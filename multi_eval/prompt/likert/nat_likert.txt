You will be given a sentence paraphrased according to specific rules.

Your task is to rate the paraphrased sentence on one metric.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.

Evaluation Criteria:

Naturalness (1-5): the quality of the paraphrased sentence in terms of idiomatic expression, colloquial appropriateness, avoidance of literal translation artifacts, and overall linguistic naturalness.

1: Poor. The sentence contains obvious non-native phrasing, awkward collocations, or retains literal translation patterns that sound unnatural.
3: Fair. The sentence has some stilted expressions or mildly unnatural phrasing but remains generally understandable.
5: Excellent. The sentence flows naturally with native-like phrasing, appropriate collocations, and no translationese features.
