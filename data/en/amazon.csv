Hey, why not release a season set and a volume  at the same time? That way season set people like my self will be happy, and the show samplers will be happy too? BTW, the one star is for the dvd single disc release, I give the show itself a solid  stars."
0,"I didnt like the Im a new medium I only started doing this stuff about  months ago, but I didnt like this book. I havent actually seen James Van Praagh work so I wont judge, but Ive lost a lot of respect for him after reading this book. First, he says that spirits dont identify themselves by their names because thats not who they are spiritually, but then while would they project themselves visually? Besides, I get hundreds of names and more importantly so does John Edward... Second he said that he heard the phone ring in a British tone and he new that that meant that Princess Diana was trying to contact him Oh, my God! Wait Jerry Lewis is contacting me right now, he saying something hold on... its... sounds like... Im umm, Im alive. Oh my God Jerry Lewis is alive and contacting me from his cell phone."
0,"Dont waste your money Garmin really missed a great opportunity with this product. If you are a really new beginner or need a refresher then this DVD might be for you. However, an instructional DVD should provide more. Downloading optional MapSource chart detail is mentioned briefly but no instruction. Instead you are referred to the user manual or the Garmin website. As I said before this was a great waste of money."

Bauer putting up with near death torture, then pulling off a huge escape without so much as limping?Okay it had its pluses but very few the opening sequence, the end and some of the thrilling action sequences. But it generally sucked. Thank god they had the time to plan season seven to make it good.Following the awesome season five, season six just wasnt up to par"
0,"Empty Treasure Chest Too bad the screenwriters ran out of energy and ideas because POTC is so original. I wished I had waited for the DVD to rent because my experience in the theater was not worth .The Singapore scene was about  minutes that couldve been shortened to  minutes and there was nothing of great significance besides the navigational maps.Jacks scene in the Doldrums was completely overlong. Again, the scene couldve been shortened to about  minutes. And whats the point of Jack licking the rock? Its a dumb shock factor.Seriously, this movie wouldve been great if there was more willpower by the crew to cut scenes down and out because theres no reason for a movie to be  hrs and  minutes long. I was so disappointed save for the battle scene in the end!. Id just stick with the first two movies and pretend I never watched the third"

0,"No secrets here Rip off book. Not sure if Jea Yu is still running his daily trading service, but this book is just another attempt to take advantage of traders who are newbies. I would love to see the authors try and trade profitably using the strategies they themselves describe.

0,"The New Terrorism More of the Same Old Stuff For those readers wanting a survey of modern terrorism and its possible courses of development, this book will suffice. The New Terrorism presents a wellresearched case that the intent of modern terrorists may increasingly be to simply cause death and damage. The authors inclusion of the criminally insane within his definition of terrorism is simultaneously disputable and thought provoking. However, the book does a poor job in thoroughly exploring the concept of WMD terrorism. This, in conjunction with organizational problems and some of the authors style choices, should place this book somewhere other than the top of potential readers buy lists. Jessica Stern provides a far better alternative in her Ultimate Terrorists."
0,"Brad Pitts MASTERPIECE BABEL is like traveling through an elaborate hedge maze to get to Jessica Simpsons high school sociology report.Pitt gives yet another of his towering, multilayered performances. The black hole vacuum he creates on the screen is so great it even sucks in the usually brilliant Kate Blanchett. Not for one minute will you believe the scenario these two play out.Kudos to one solitary brilliant moment when a deafmute attends a rave club though its relation to the film is laughable, as is this whole story thread. The rest of the movie plays out like a bad remake of TALES OF MANHATTAN, only this time with a gun instead of a hat.I can think of episodes of Threes Company that had more original, profound statements to make than this film."

0,"Goes Downhill After the Title I like a clever mix of fact and fiction, but after plodding a couple of dozen pages into this, I did not want to turn the page any more. I tried a bit further on and was rewarded by reading  pages about whether one guy was going to kill the chicken of this other guy. He finally does, and what is the result? Nothing much.My first mistake was not noticing the usual sign of overhypecomparing a contemporary work to real classics Ian Fleming and John LeCarre. The other tipoff is the author is a reporter for the SunTimes and UPI and his reviewers are fellow newspaper proletariat. Their profuse gushing over his skill raises an eyebrow since Ive never heard of this guy. In all,  cents might not be too high a price for this, but remember, youll have to pay postage also."

0,"Not one of Clancys best This was not one of Clancys greater novels. Some of the action scenes kept you rivited but, after awhile it was hard to believe one submarine could sneek up on the entire Chinese fleet and sink over  ships and subs. Also, there was a lot of repetitive sayings such as open the outer doors make tubes one and two ready etc.. every action paragraph. Finally, The book is easy to follow and I have to commend his knowledge of warfare but, this was not one of his finest writings."

The mistake I made and am warning you about is that during the introduction The Importance of Being Bachman King gives away the ending!!! Not just a Oh, and then something negative happens but Blah, blah, and then he blah blah specifically. If you want to enjoy the book as I am CERTAIN I would have DO NOT READ THE INTRODUCTION!!!!Who does that?? Yes, I get it, it has been republished so you want to add a note, but for those who would have picked up the book for the first time never had seen the movie either so I dont know if it tells the true ending the book has been ruined!!!. . . I always pictured Stephen King as a smart man. . . WRONG!So please! Add a HUGE SPOILER warning before you give the ending of a book before the story even starts!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
0,"Outlaw all postrelease editing. This is truly one the most spectacular films ever made, not suffering for having been made during the silent era. However, as correctly stated by another review of the film, the DVD version runs to mins as oppossed to the VHS mins. This is not due to DVD faster frame rate, but rather because the DVD version has had a huge portion of the film cut for no obvious reason. At one point, the Hero Fairbanks has fulfilled the prophecy of the princess and has been the first to touch the rosetree, the next minute he is seen explaining to her in an intimate scene that he is not what he seems. Having seen the VHS a number of times, I can confirm that the DVD version has been brutally cut. Do not buy the DVD version, as it is a letdown with those scenes missing thus the reason for my one star, which would otherwise have been    stars with the Rimsky Korsakov soundtrack. You have been warned!"

I have lots of experience with VB and ASP and the reason I bought this book was because I thought that I can improve upon my internet skills and also because I understood that XML was a relatively easy technology to learn. But the author in this book is just introducing the programmer to various xml related technologies without explaining clearly what is for what and what is deemed as useful for average programmer.Maybe I was confused when I bought this book!!"

I was looking at the expensive ones, but this one seemed similar and okay for home use. The package came in a reasonable amount of time and was packed wellnot the shippers fault at all. The company that makes it however, puts A LOT of strong fragrance in there. I understand having a little lavender but I was gagging a little on the volume of it and the camomile. I followed the directions for microwave heating, but it has been a couple of weeks, and I use it twice a day. It heats up well still, but my god it stinks like burnt rice now. My kids have requested that I stop using it because it just plain stinks. The cover is still clean, and it only stinks after a reheatbut buy a higher quality neck pad with buckwheat or something if you are gonna need it for an extended time. Not spa quality for sure."
0,"Garmin Street Pilot III training video I was under the mistaken impression that this video would train a new person in how to use the Street Pilot III. I purchased the Street Pilot III from Amazon.com and this video popped up as a recommended additional purchase. The video is only a few minutes long and is only intended on introducing store sales people on what it is, not how it works. I would not even recommend it for the intended audience since the first time someone asks you a question about the product you will be stumped unless you read the directions to gain familiarity with the unit."

0,"Great Movie, Poor Quality DVD I dont know who to blame, Warner Brothers for making a dud DVD, or Amazon for selling me what was obviously a returned DVD. There was a handwritten serial number at the top of the cardboard cover, and the plastic wrap covering it was very shoddy.The DVD itself was dirty, but I cleaned it and played it to see if that was the extent of the damage. It wasnt. The sound goes in and outwith long periods of silenceduring the  interviews with surviving cast members Margaret Hamilton, Ray Bolger, and Jack Haley. The rest of the behindthescenes extras seems to have been spared. I havent watched the movie itself yet, so Im hopeful that at least the movie is intact. If not, Ill return the DVD and wait for the October release of the Oz DVD package.The film is a classic, beloved by million and millions. Not even a dud DVD can tarnish this gem of a movie."

They are not there, and neither are Hamlets beautiful lines I have of late but wherefore I know not lost of all my mirth . . . what a piece of work is man . . These two friends of Hamlet brought a certain depth to him, his complaint about being played on like a flute, which helps to establish that whatever else Hamlet was, he was first of all a Prince, and next to the Crown.

The writer has recklessly exaggerated the history and the science of diamonds in such a manner that it would hardly be acceptable in fiction, but this is presented as a true tale. It is so loaded with distortions and errors, ever poor writing, that I find it amazing that the dust cover carries praise from what would, on first blush, appear to be reliable reviewers. On second blush, I am not so sure.I am still plowing through this awful thing, but am flagging questionable passages on just about every other page. That is, only the things that I know are incorrect or shamelessly distorted. It is quite clear that Times BooksHenry Holt WH Freeman never vetted the text of this book before publishing it.I was the former curator of the mineral and gem collection at the Smithsonian before retiring in  so I know a little about the subject...."

To my disappointment, this product came in a box that looked like it was badly beaten. The package was practically open when I received it. That wasnt the worst part. When I finally sat on the bench it was unsteady and was rocking side to side and forth as if the legs were uneven. I took a closer look and and one of the feet is actually bent. Its not safe at all for my toddler daughter who is lightweight because it wobbles with her.

0,"Boring JoJo is pretty, and Leave Get Out is a really catchy song, but I think the main reason shes famous is because of her young age. JoJo has a lot of vocal talent, and most people wouldnt expect that from a thirteen or fourteen year old. But if JoJo was sixteen and came out with an album this...boring, I dont think it would be as big of a hit. Also, because JoJo is younger, its easier for younger girls to relate to her In some ways. Myself, I tried listening to her album, and it was just too much RB for me. I would like JoJo much, much better if she sang pop songs. I might even be a big fan. But this CD just bored me. I get bored easily with slow songs, and thats pretty much all this album is. Leave Get Out is the only song with feeling, and good music. I think there could have been more of a variety of songs on this album, and I hope JoJo will be around long enough to make a better followup album.This review was brought to you by,GMM Gold Mew Mew"

Also, the lyrics themselves may differ from what you are used to as they have been translated differently from the original English.

0,"Voices of the Loon As someone who spends summers in British Columbia and who has fallen in love with the loons on the lake there, this is a precious cd. There is no addition of music, thankfully, so loons are foregrounded this is pure loon call. The most helpful part of this cd is the narration, which instructs the listener in what various calls mean. Now when we know when they are feeling threatened, when theyre mating, and the nuances of their communication. And it is hauntingly lovely to hear their calls again this recording will tide us over through the winter until we can return to the north and its loons."

0,"Ambitious program People have been doing crossovers for years, and therefore we shouldnt discriminate against new singers who prefer to go that path. Unfortunately, the record producers have chosen a far too ambitious program for Russell Watson, who doesnt yet have the strength of voice, the security of technique and the experience of a seasoned performer to pull it off. As a result, the singing here falls flat and some of the tracks are embarrassing. I hope there can be a better program design next time, which can then showcase the young singer in a better light."

People give good reviews for these ipods simply because they havent tried anything else, because the ipod is so popular.

0,"Disappointing... At  pages, What to Eat certainly looks appealing and authoritative. However, while Nestles book does contain some good information, it doesnt live up to its bold title. I was expecting more of a treatise on healthful foods, mixed with an equal part of what foods to avoid. Instead, Nestle focuses entirely on what to avoid, brushing off, for example, vegetables with a single, scant chapter. Now, I could see the value even in this approach, but the organization of the book a meandering collection of chapters that do not flow coherently and Nestles odd tone of not giving a very clear opinion of what to avoid or not to avoid, mars the books practical value significantly. A better book that fulfills her objective more thoroughly is Andrew Weils Eating Better for Optimum Health, which covers almost entirely the same topics, while being thoughtfully organized and much more informative."

His PHD was earned from Columbia Pacific University, a mailorder diploma mill that was shut down by the California attorney general. Im not saying that his ideas are all worthless Ive read the book and there do seem to be a few common sense pointers.

I liked the propaganda about attracting more bugs because of the true black light, and the light sensor. I had an older bug zapper, so I placed it about  feet from this new one. The old zapper worked good, as always. This zapper zapped once or twice when it first turned on, but then not much more. I dont know if it was because it didnt attract bugs, or if the high voltage wasnt working. It lit up every night for about  weeks, the after the first rain....KAPUT!

If you didnt read the fraudulent predecessor, youd be lostor maybe not since its written on a third grade reading level. Frey pulled a fast one on me a few years ago. I dismissed the writing style then because I thought we were dealing with someone with a fragile state of mind. Here, there seems to be a lack of consistency. What happened to his love of reading from the first book? It changes to drawings and paintings in this book. Im supposed to believe a struggling screenwriter turns down massive amount of money left to him from a friend that loved him like a fatherand what about the strife between him and his parents? It just melts away? I just hated this book. I read it because I bought it before the scandal broke and it was the next book in my TBR pile.

But I have to give Shaznay some credit, at least she tried to sing. The All Saints should be locked up for doing this"
0,Lewis  Clark  The great Journey West Most of my Zone  dvds open here in China without problems hence the many purchases. This DVD product is specifically marked with a Security label warning and would not play either. I just wish that such products specifically labelled are highlighted in the online catalogue before one reaches the shopping basket and thus save the hassles of product return. Maybe the delivery destination can also be used as a cross check for labelled security products. A one star rating was assigned to progress along the the review program steps although the product was unopened.Dennis Hulse
0,"Not pleasant. After unsuccessfully trying to enjoy this CD over the past several years, I finally decided to throw it in the trash  and write a review to share with you all. This may have been enjoyable as a simple TV variety show, but its unpleasant to listen to as a CD. The vocalists have such different styles and degrees of quality, that they dont belong on the same CD. The different types of songs are jarring when put on the same CD. The pairing of some of these vocalists with some of these songs is downright unpleasant. The orchestra music is simplistic, nonnuanced, and does not stand on its own it is simply at the service of the vocalists, with songs generally starting with the briefest of orchestral introductions before some vocalist starts belting out the words. I give it  stars, because the title still gives me a warm, fuzzy feeling  I LOVE the idea of Christmas in Vienna!"
0,"Very boring, written unclearly I vehemently dislike this textbook. The math is unclear or not well explained, and it makes Graphics seem like a stale, formulaic, and unattractive subject. Note, however, that I have only read the first several chapters. I dont plan on reading any more."
0,"what is all the rage about this book??? I ordered this book because of the stellar reviews here on amazon. I was totally disappointed. The adult scenes was done with no feeling whatsoever, it was told very clinically, with no description. What about the tastes, feels, smells, sounds? There is more to adult scenes than he put this there and she submitted. Blah!The entire first half of the book is boring historywar type stuff. The maid that is described as her having a thing with is mentioned in one sentence and then never again and not once does she have a thing with her! Perhaps it is a good account of harem life. But that is all it is. An account. It is not descriptive, enticing, or even entertaining. It is written like something from a textbook. Yawn! If you want to know how it feels, do not bother with this book...im not even sure why I gave this two stars."
0,"Did nothing!! I read great reviews on this one and decided I would give it a try, but sad to say it did nothing at all for my frizz! And barely anything for the shine. It was disappointing, I wouldnt recommend it at all."

Allow me to save you a couple hundred dollars learn to count your breathsbreathe in to  beats. Exhale for  seconds. Do this for  minutes and it can lower your blood pressure maybe  points on top. But drop it below ? I havent experienced that."
0,"A book that easiy can be forgotten. There was a big disappointment in this book. It told me nothing new the subjects covered have all been covered elsewhere, and very few Indian stories from the time of the battle are retold. Also, the physical size of the book, x, is a mark against it, making it clumsy to handle and read unles you have a flat table to rest it on. On the plus side, though, it contains many photographs of the combatants, some which are rarely seen."
0,"Very Mediocre Book If I was looking for a book on Meditating, Zen, etc...I would have simply bought a book on those items. Being a North Dakota native I would much rather read a book on Roger Maris anyday.It wasnt a terrible book, but it wasnt great either. The only thing that kept me interested was how MJ and Scottie took to Phils different philosophies. I haven read any of his other books, but maybe they are a little better. I would highly recommend reading Rick Majerus Like on a Napkin over this overhyped book. I guess if you are into spiritual type stuff you may enjoy the book. Phil has definetly been pretty darn succesful so I guess hes doing something right!!"
0,"ehhhh not quite..... Length  MinsMy review is simple..just look at the picture on my vid of the what they have on the products container...even worse is once you put in several bills, it wont stay folded! Funny, my leather wallet does...and whats best about leather is that it formsmolds around to the contents inside after a while...Maybe there is no replacing leather or leather wallets...only exception is a zip enclosed type of walletcoin purse, that way you can fit it very easy when ever you go to amusement parks, beached, etc..."
0,Ug! Painful! Worst book I have ever read!! If you are a male clothes horse of the s you might enjoy the VERY DETAILED descriptions of every outfit that every character in every scene is wearing right down to socks and sunglasses. I found it distracting and not relevent to the story line.
0,"Not really bundled The product as advertised Requires full version of Descent Freespace  The Great War this is quoted verbatim from the CD case it was shipped in, which is not bundled in like this page would have you believe. The game was completely unplayable until I purchased that from another source, obviously."
0,"Not Applicables greatest performance yet! While the movie as a whole is lame, this is undoubtedly Not Applicables finest movie. It is truly amazing to see how far he has come since teen Dude of the Dead."
0,Cello great. recording BAD Cello and piano playing is wonderful sound recording is terrible. I cannot believe this recording made it to the marketplace. The sound engineer must have placed the mike at about the level of the sternum on Starker. You can hear him inhaling in many of the recordings ...... very distracting. What a shame to spoil what would otherwise have been a great performance.
0,"Constant False Alarms Great idea, but very poor quality. The constant false alarms make it useless. I installed it  off the ground, out of direct sunlight. Right now, I have it on my desk, pointing at a wall  FOOT away and it is still continuously going off.Piece of junk."
0,"Good Idea, Poor Conversion From Idea To Words The idea of the book was very intelligent and interesting, dealing with rights and wrongs, accomplisments, actions and there consequences. But the book, to me, was written poorly. When reading the novel, my mind always wandered becasue of the dragging on of events. It used difficult language, uncommon words, and was saturated with too many words. The  page novel could have easily been shrinked down into an  page story. It was repititive in its ideas and difficult to concentrate on. Its not the worst book Ive read for school, but I would definelty not read this book in my leisure time."
0,"returned it. The item did not work in my location, so I returned it in its original package as per instructions. I hope that I get the credit back as I used my credit card to purchase it. I returned it last month."
0,"Poor quality Upon trying this on, the first thing that became clear was the cheapness of the zipper, which feels like its going to catch and break at any moment. Secondly, the poor quality of the vinyl used makes noise with every move you make. And third, the lapels wouldnt fold like they are in the picture, even after I tried to weigh it down with books heat would not be an option for the material.There are better quality costumes out there at similar pricing, try one of those."
0,"junk Used this maybe  times. Unit ran dry a couple nights ago it has a shut off. Used it last night and it shut off after  minutes. I use RO water so there was no build up in the heat element. Triple checked to make sure it was hooked up correctly. No go. BTW, I was getting about  hours on a full tank on high and about  hours on low. I can return it to the manufacturer at about  shipping plus give them a check for  handling. For something I spent  on five weeks ago? Right. I see it is now ...."
0,"one tiny notch above junk The FT is one tiny notch above junk. I got it working as a wireless laptoptoprinter cable, but no thanks to the instructions, as it doesnt work at all if they are followed. The network access point function and the web manager wont activate without a pairing PIN, the instructions say nothing about pairing, no reasonable guess works, and there is no hardware reset or bypass. Phone service doesnt connect to a person it asks you to leave a voice message and promises to get back within  hours it has been  days. Buy ANYTHING else!"
0,"Cant get crispy crust Weve had this baking stone for several months and make pizza xweek. Its definitely a step up from an aluminium pan, but no matter how hotlong we preheated, we were not getting a crispy crust unless we put the dough on the stone plain.. and cooked it for several minutes before adding toppings.As an experiment, I tried a cast iron pancake griddle I had rectangular... I got crispy crust the st time."

0,Terrible Absolutly the worse hose that I have ever had. i bought it because it was  and I wanted a lighter weight hose to unroll from a hand reel daily for watering plants. The hose swelled up with multiple bulges and leaks within the first week. I threw it away within two weeks. i did not return the product because I did not want a replacement. It was poorlt constructed.
0,"Pretty Bad I had expected a lot more from this movie, but it let me down. It was boring after the first  minutes or so.But then, thats me. I expected a lot more from Prometheus too, but it was too much like Aliens. Cyborg. Pop out of your gut monsters."
0,"Great Band But The Record Label Has Poor Taste... The cover of this CD features a burning shark. Someone in the marketing department at DeadlineCleopatra Records obviously had his head up his ass to even think that this was even remotely funny. Considering the tragic fire that happened Feb. th,  when Great White was playing a gig in Rhode Island, and the fact that PEOPLE DIED in it makes this shameless attempt to cash in on others misfortune even sicker. I personally will never buy anything that has the Deadline or Cleopatra labels on it."
0,"Buy another game So this game has great potential, awesome storyline, awesome characters, such a great base. But the gameplay quickly takes it all away. Only one superpower, very little in way of changing hits, and everytime you fight a boss you get whipped because you cannot do anything. Want to do something more worthwhile? Go buy the new Xmen game"
0,NOT IMPRESSED I bought this book thinking it would be something like the Betty Crocker kids cookbook I had when I was little. I was really disappointed. I wouldnt even call it a cook book. There arent many true recipes in it. Betty Crocker could have done better.

0,"Distracting typos and mistakes Regardless of the writing itself, which seems to be ok, this version of the book has so many typos and mistakes throughout the book that it was constantly distracting and irritating. Id find another version or buy the book in hardcopy rather than tolerate this poorly transcribed version."
0,"Do not recommend This book falls short in its scholarship and demonstrates a lack of insight intothe subject. In addition, it has many instances of poor writing and grammar. Not enoughpictures for the money. Poorly constructed and prepared index. Not recommended."
0,"Writing ones belief doesnt make it Truth... Truth and fear are mutually exclusive. Could have been said in  pages or less. Forced erudition. Fraught with the vibration of ego. Subtle fearmongering generously dispersed throughout. To use an expression from the book, its tainted  big time."
0,"I did not like the paperback form of this book  I like hardcopy  the price was too high and it took a long time for me to get The information in the book is great but what I do not like is the paperback covering of the book the hardcopy covering is much better and looks great. I order this book for a gift to Newly Weds but it looks to cheap that I do not want to give it as a gift...Also, it took so long to get this produc in the mail not sure what was the hold up."

I bought a case of this stuff at Amazon figuring how bad can it be? I was wrong! This stuff is DISGUSTING!!!You always hear about a product having a bad after taste, but this stuff gives you the vile taste first. Ive tried mixing it with honey, milk, butter and even lemon juice trying to kill the bad taste. It doesnt work!DO NOT BUY THIS DISGUSTING PRODUCT!!!"
0,"THIS BOOK IS FOR BEGINNERS ONLY!! I was unable to enjoy this book as it was more for beginning savers only. More seasoned savers will find this book very basic and repetitive. There was nothing in this book that I did not already know and seemed like it was written for a girl that is still in college, just moved out of her parents house, or fresh out of college. Do not purchase this book if you have been saving for a few months and researching online as most of this information is dated."
0,"Very informative about the liberal agenda If you ever wondered about why liberals behave the way they do, or advocate big government, then this book is a must read. The book describes history in light of social justice. Social justice is defined as redistribution of wealth and political power from those that have it to those that do not. History is defined by deviding it into those periods in which progress was made in redistributing the wealth and power, and those periods when progress in those areas were not made. Anything towards that end is described as good, and vise versa. In my humble opinion, this book is scary and should be a must read by everyone who plans on going into a voting booth. The book gives you a clear idea of why liberals want bigger and bigger government and ever increasing taxes, but directly from their game plantext book."
0,"The s were really pathetic As a now baby boomer.I must of been about  when this came out.I never knew how poor an actor Kurt Russell actually was.This movie is like a really badly written Disney movie.Awful lines,silly effects,bad acting,predictable plot.A real waste of ..

0,"So far its been a waste of my money... Purchased this book around Xmas. Month and a half have passed and I have not been able to make one good use out of this book. In my opinion, this is a college text book for students who know knowing about Linux and want to learn Administrative concepts. It is a worthless book for handson administrators as well it is worthless for people like me who know enough and need to explore advance topics."
0,"not at all what i expected Okay...I was so disappointed. I was all excited to hear iiee by Meegs and Jessicka bc Coal Chamber and Jack Off Jill are two of my favorite bands but I didnt like what they did with the song. I would have to say that there are a few songs that I can listen to Cornflake Girl, Winter, Crucify, God Caught a lite sneeze made me laugh. I love Tori, and I love the idea that people want to do covers of her songs and I understand that when you do a cover you should make it your own, and it shouldnt sound exactly like the original but come on. Im sure that if I wasnt a fan of Tori,and maybe had never heard the originals that these songs could be great. Or if I bought the cd of any of the bands that are on the tribute maybe Id like some of their own stuff. I would buy the CD with caution...it was quite something to listen to for the first time."
0,"YUCK! In general, I like coconut. This was awful. At first it was really watery and progressively became more concentrated even though I shook it several times. The packaging was pretty neat, but that is the only positive thing I have to say which is rather sad."
0,"Reading James GARBARINO would be much more valuable Dobsons approach is simplistic, dualistic and limited. He, like so many, yearns for the good ole days which never were for most people in this country, at least those who werent white males or economically privileged. Ive grown up with his kind and the world is far more complex than they wish it would be. They ascribe to all the shoulds of fairy tales and storybook religion, not enlightened, mindful, compassionate, thoughtful spirituality. Dobson, Falwell, Bennett, Robertson, Bauer  all the same types and perspectives  these are not the people Jesus would consider spiritual leaders or people to be emulated from my perspective. Any reader would be far better served by the works and insights of James Garabarino, Dan Millman, Geoffrey Africa, William S. Pollack, John Stoltenberg among others who are far more thoughtful and informed."
0,"A response... To Wolfgirl I wasnt looking for earthshattering passion, just a good book. And this wasnt it! Yes, there are plenty of great writers around, some of them who even write subtle romances, some of whom write some excellent humour. But, judging by this book, Barbara Sherrod is not one of them. I read a lot of Regencies, as you might see if you check my review page. This is one of the very few books I couldnt even bring myself to finish. And when Ive paid good money for a book, that isnt something I do as a rule.Sure, were all entitled to our opinions. If you liked this, great. However, I still cant recommend it and I stick by my assessment of it as tedious."

Just trains. So, if youre child likes trains I would think they would really like this book. But, its not that fun of a book to read. Just pretty good train pictures."

0,"REQUEST TO ALL REVIEWERS Can we NOT retell the entire book when posting a review??? More than once Ive ended up not buying a book  not because of a bad review, but because after reading the reviews I already knew the beginning, middle, and ending of the book! This is silly and extremely inconsiderate.A review is where you give your opinion about the book andor the author. Thats what we want here. Cliffnotes is where you rewrite the book, giving away details and plots and endings.Thats NOT what we want here. Its just common sense. Please."
0,"Not really Linda This was not written by Linda Lovelace, but by Chuck Traynor. He makes it sound like it was Linda, but if youve read Ordeal, youll understand that the real Linda did not believe anything which was in this book, nor did she consent to the pictures which are part of it. Not recommended at all."

0,"Unneccesary rancor  circular logic It seems that she is saying that Kids today are screwed up because their parents get advice from experts. Parents should stop listening to advice from those experts and, instead, follow her advice.My own personal opinion is that every kid needs a responsible, involved parent who takes the time to understand them  discover what it takes to teach them what they need to know to become responsible adults themselves and to lead a good life.If the advice that the author has regarding parenting works for you to teach your kids what they need to know to be responsible adults, then follow it or use the parts that work for you  your family. I think that the parenting advice in here could have been presented without putting down other parenting methods that most certainly do work for other parents and families."

I live in Florida, and to this day, I cannot get the home receiverboom box to receive any signal, unless I go outside. Even in my office, which has an open bay window facing west which is the exposure the company suggests for Florida, the product is unable to acquire a signal. The car kit works fine. When I called the company to complain, they could offer no advice at all, told me to put the antenna outside, which is very impractical at home, when my air conditioner is on, and impossible at my office, where my windows do not open.

0,"Too many errors, factual, historical, literary... Its hard to take this work seriously when its so full of errors. The author became a selfproclaimed Brazilianist overnight and it shows.

0,"clever, hip, NOT SCARY Kevin Williamsons script is almost as scary as an episode of Felicity, Dawsons Creek, or any other work of his hes put on television since the release of this unfrightening fright film. Come on Craven, lets get back to the basics. The ending will not hold up to close scrutiny. The only thing this film did, was open the doors for alot of BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD socalled horror films like Halloween H, I Know What You Did Last Summer, Halloween Resurrection and I Still Know What You Did Last Summer."
0,"Wanted to love this but... I really wanted to like this book. I enjoy Baldaccis writing style, but it seemed like he tried a little too hard with this one. Think about every cliche and far fetched idea u can imagine, and try to sell it as a Christmas story. Look, i understand the concept of a Christmas book. Something sad happens, then something nice happens and you feel better. However, this book seemed like too much went wrong, and felt like it had no soul. It certainly didnt warm me up at all. The characters lacked any depth and i felt no empathy towards any of them. There are plenty of better Christmas books out there. The only saving grace was that its a very quick read. If you want a warm and cozy Christmas story, look elsewhere."

Just before hurricane Irene I serviced the system to get it back up and online, unsuccessfully. The BATTERY alarm is still beeping, as I type, even after cleaning the terminals and fillingup with distilled. I likely need more acid, and this is such a pain in the rear end."

0,"A Blooming Waste Im not much of a reviewer, but I do know how to warn people. If you get this book you will not find out how to read a book, you will not find out why to read a book, you will learn more than you want to know about the random blathering of an outdated, selfabsorbed, academic eunich. The book appears to be Professor Blooms chance to espouse every opinion he ever had and espouse them as gospel requiring no proof or support. He tells me that I should read to discover myself, then he gives a bunch of plot summaries and oblique references to Chekov or Borges. I dont know if I found myself in this book, but I came to my senses after about  pages."
0,"Dangerous to use The Product is designed very well... Except the one area that is most important. The cutting edge. It is made of bad quality metal. The blades dull very verry fast, making it difficult to cut with. My attempts to sharpen the blades show the blades are not made to sharpen. The metal is too soft. When using dull cutting blades user can get more hurt than sharp blades. When using dull cutting blades, more pressure must be applied to cut things resulting in an uncontrolled jerk movement then the item finally cuts which could result in user getting cut.It is amazing this item was not forced to be recalled. I guess not many stores will carry this item because of danger"

Ive bought the DVD sets, all of the CRIME STORY series, and the quality is terrible, practically a blurred picture, not really worth the purchase price.

The quality is worse than your memories of the show."
0,Water I think the good doctor could have condensed the book down to a few pages to get his basic premise across. The rest is fill where Dr Batmanghelidji acclaims himself against a hostile environment of nonacceptance of his ideas by other medical practitioners. He is to be congratulated in being courageous enough to go against the lucrative practice of other physicians who are better known for prescribing useless or harmful drugs to treat conditions which would respond to changes in lifestyle.I enjoyed the book but found myself skimming to find the the real meaningful information I was seeking.

0,"Great Idea, poor quality product. I bought this set thinking, Wow! This is fantastic, I dont have to worry about having an extra colander. Plus, it costs so little!! WOW!!!! I always hate cleaing a colander and since I just moved, I couldnt use my roommates colander anymore. This was a perfect product for a pasta eater. Or so I thought. The first couple times I used them, they were fablous. I found it fun and exciting to make pasta. I washed it a couple times in both the dishwasher and by hand. After a bit it started to develop rust wherever the paint was scratched. You are thinking, Bah! No big deal, Ill just use wooden or plastic utensils. Sure, go ahead but on the small pot the way they keep the lid on for straining is by two little metal nubs that you line up with the grooves on the lid, then turn it tight. Well, those little metal nubs scratch the lid, not to mention just putting on the lid seems to scratch the paint or whatever coating it is they have on there."

They arent teaching...its more like rote repitition. On top of this, there are several critical typos and since you dont know the what and whys, they are that much harder to uncover. This could have been a great tutorial if IBM didnt assume it was writting to supertechies. Next time guys...EXPLAIN THE STEPS!"
0,"A Sad Recreation Overall, this movie was not impressive. The characters seemed to be too stereotypical for my tastes, with the eccentric inventor, the hapless but cute girls, and the clutsy but wellmeaning guy.Gone is the mystery of the Doctor and Susans origins. Gone is the darkness of the script. I know, I know, the original series was a bit lame, but thats because of the budget. The script by itself was suspenseful. This recreation had none of that.In fact, the only thing I find likable about this was the TARDIS interior. It was an interesting change."
0,"turd Ive had  or  of these things. The first one to fail was due to the very short strain relief. The wire burned up just like so many on the internet. I wasnt tough on it, but youll have to take my word for it. Heck, the cord has only been unplugged from its outlet maybe a dozen times. I never roll it up and jam it in a bag, but it failed anyway.The replacement, and all adapters since have been the newer T sytle connector with the slightly bigger strain relief. These have all experienced the broken springs problem. Im headed to the apple store to buy another one of these things for my  macbook tomorrow. I hope the macbook air style magsafe works better than the old ones did."
0,"Mm... not quite.... No Postscript support! So no printing under OSX or Linux without jumping through some serious hoops.Colors are REALLY funky. Images are not even close to being accurate.Other than that. Its a great printer for someone just looking to replace a monochrome printer and who only print under Windows. If you have the space for this monster. BTW the support Lexmark claims for OSX and Linux is a straight up lie. They support OSX ., will not work with .. and no Linux support at all."

0,Poor Cheap Plastic Gimmick I saw what I THOUGHT was the same set and WmsSonoma and then found these online. I bought them from Amazon since they were much cheaper. They are all plastic and arrived damaged. The clear plastic portion was broken on the salt mill and would not attach to the top portion. The pepper mill was cracked as well. They are very light weight and cheaply made. Get the real ones from the retail store. They are solid aluminum and real glass. I did. Amazon was pretty good about the return after two phone calls to get my money credit back.
0,"Long, Bloody, Boring Movie Mel Gibson has done it again, but THIS time he bloodied Jesus Christ for personal gain! Yikes, the movie was bad. But then, I didnt go into it believing it was anything else but a MOVIE. Made by Actors, Screenwriters, etc., and a product of Gibsons bloody mind. As for a deep, religious experience, Im not too lazy to open up my Bible and read the word of God. Thats moving and uplifting for any soul. This MOVIE, let me say that again, this MOVIE, is so violent its just sad. So the Pope endorsed an R rated movie. It figures!"

0,"Atypical mystery novel I was looking for something more like an Agatha Christie or M.M. Kaye when I picked up this book. In contrast to those books, this had littletono suspense. The characters are warm and the setting is interesting, but the book reads more like a series of short stories about Botswana and its people rather than a mystery. In themes, its sort of a cross between The Color Purple and a Harlemrenaissance book called The ConjureMan Dies, but much less interesting than both. I finished the book, there were some amusing vignettes, but overall it leaves much to be desired."
0,"Bad Disc I got this series in peices some seasons from retail stores and then I decided to order one of the last seasons I needed from here. I got it only to discover that one of the discs the last one in this season three in fact doesnt work. So I could not watch the season ender which was really frustrating.I paid for a paper wieght it seems.The series itself is ok enough, but its hard to get a complete view when the discs dont all work."

0,"Increasingly Unbelievable The book started off really well, decently detailed, very possible dialogue and a good plot. This goes on till about half the book, even the parts about Scot Harvath trampling on the crime scenes, having superhuman strength so as to overcome his numerous injuries is acceptable. But when he escapes each and every assassination attempt, walks into premeditated gunfights poorly armed, lack of detailing as to his preparation which I would have expected to be a must as its in the genre of factual based thrillers, all this just made it mediocre. If you want to read about a onemanarmy but with a more plausible storyline, better detailed plot along the same concept of danger to the US president, read Transfer of Power by Vince Flynn."
0,"A Comprehensive but poorly written book On the plus side, this book hits all the bases. The code examples are well chosen and concise. The information seems accurate and up to date.Unfortunately its something of a hodgepodege. The lead author does a poor job of organizing the book into a coherent whole.It refers in passing to concepts which are not covered until later in the book. If this were my first XML book, I think I would find these quite confusing. At the local Borders I spent some time looking through Learning XML by OReilly  admittedly a less comprehensive and advanced book and was struck by it s better, clearer the writeing."
0,"No Puck  soft porn pretends to be Shakespeare! What a disappointment! I am a great fan of Shakespeares A Midsummer Nights Dream, and have many different film versions of it. This version sounded like a combination of the classic comedy tale by William S. and a bit of the old naughty. Well, it did have some naughty  simulated sex with a small bit of T and A. But where the Puck was Shakespeare?This type of adult movie is pretty much outofdate. It is soft porn, or Rrated, with a few OKlooking women topless. The ONLY reference I could find to A Midsummer Nights Dream was that Justine SLEPT, and had sexy DREAMS.Plus the movie made no sense. There was no continuity of the various scenes. It was just a crappy script created as an excuse to film naked women."
0,"Poor quality device I bought one of these for myself and the MB version for my wife. We both used them at the gym for about  months before both of them had issues. My wifes doesnt work unless she uses a full battery every couple of days...did the flash update and that still didnt help. Mine the volume sticks on high even though the volume switch isnt stuck. Got them at best buy but they no longer carry them probably for a reason. These were supposed to be made for running  gym activity...but definately were not. Also, the earphones are a pain to work."
0,"Not Good! As an established black Insider Im always having to defend my peoples work, however it is becoming more and more difficult everytime Another Black film fails to entertain. What I try and inspire in the community is that if your trying to be a writer or a director you should be original and provoke thought. Forget trying to throw in Over the hill actors who have No box office appeal. This film over all was just bad with no positives to mention. It was cliche, slow and a waste of time!"

0,"Battery Killer The battery is such a big headache. This camera only works when I put in new or freshly recharged batteries. If Im using the video taping feature, it will quickly start complaining the low battery.If I leave the new batteries in the camera, the camera will not work because of the battery the next time when I try to use it, even its just the following day.Whats really odd The usedup batteries from this camera are actually usable in my old digital camera.

Although it can be a bit drying at times if thats all you use, I find I have to switch up the shampoos every other month to prevent that. But its Vegan and great for your hair.But I ordered this shampoo, this very link, and got a huge bottle of conditioner instead. The labeling is very misleading it says shampooing and conditioning but its def a bottle of conditioner. I barely use any conditioner, this will last me more than a year.. and wasted my money"
0,"Why we can say the author is a procommunist... The Words of Mr. Unko Tamezo is basically true. Most of Mr. Yoshimis books are published from Otsuki Shoten Pub. and Iwanami Shoten Pub., both well known as procommunistic publications. Esp. No anticommunists want to publish their books from Otsuki Shoten. Please remember Korean people is totally in the dark by the Korean government. All both compensations were completed by the JapanSouth Korea Basic Treaty . So, their acts are a sort of duplicate billing."
0,"Difficult to see words Im not sure why everyone loves this book so much. There are at least three pages on which there is extremely dark lettering on a very dark background. Whoever made the decision to mix these colors made a terrible mistake. Its to the point where you literally can not read it comfortably and there is no way my son will be able to try to read it by himself... he wont even be able to see the words! Maybe if the next printing has light colored text on the dark backgrounds it could be better, but as it is now, this book fails at its main purpose it is impossible to read."
0,"Four Month Failure  It Worked Until It Didnt I purchased this product in August , and it worked very well for a time. Hot beverages stayed piping hot for hours and hours. It does seem to seal quite well, and never leaked to the OUTSIDE.Then yesterday, I realized that the outside of the container was hot immediately after I poured in morning tea, and then was cool by the afternoon. Somewhere inside, the vacuum seal has been breached, and the whole thing is shot.Pretty pricey tool just for four months of hot tea, and I would not purchase this again."

0,"Quit after a week I bought this as my first true espresso machine after using drip coffee makers for years. I didnt want to overspend without knowing whether I could really make espresso or not. After doing my research on coffeegeek, I decided that the Ariete would be a decent compromise between price and quality. Long story short, it died after five days about  shots or so.It makes a decent shot and warmed up quickly. I was quite impressed with the looks of the machine and how quickly it warmed up and was ready to pull a shot.I never got the chance to replace the pressurized portafilter with an non pressurized version but that was the next step I was going to take before the machine quit working.Despite my bad experience with the machine itself, Amazon did a fantastic job of taking care of the return, customer service get a A"
0,"As good as it gets I have used portable jigsaws and sabersaws for most of my forty years as a general contractor. Last year my Bosch barrel handled jig saw of some  years service was stolen, along with  worth of other tools, from my truck toolbox. I tried other jigsaws and also the Bosch D handle jigsaw but was very dissapointed with their performances. I was reluctant to spend the extra money on another Bosch barrel handled jigsaw at first, but I am very happy to have popped the extra few dollars for the control the Bosch jigsaw gives me. In addition, the toolless blade change that was missing on my old Bosch jigsaw makes the purchase of the new one even more satisfying.Kudos to Bosch on a great tool for anyone who is using a jigsaw for any task requiring the extra control the barrel handle gives the user."

0,filthy I was shocked by the condition of this used book. There was coffe stains on the pages. The cover literally had food or something stuck to it. I had to use cleaning products on it to wipe off the crap on the cover and back. The book itself is wonderful but I think the sender must live in a garbage house. I was a bit afraid to use the book not know what other germs could be on it.
0,"Dark. Depressing. Unrelenting. Truly a LONG  SLOW read twisted descriptions mean evil characters. No good to be found here. This is the last time Mr. McCormac wastes my reading time.

I love the fact its bagless and it has great suction but the filter is a chore to get out and it fills every time Iuse it. The debris collects in a very easy to remove andreplace container but it is a VERY small container and if I dont vacuum every day I have to empty it after each room. I would recommend another vacuum with a larger container and a better designed filter."
0,"Poor Quality  Numbers Came Off First Use I bought this expensive meat thermometer thinking that with the cost would come a quality item you get what you pay for  not.

What a total disappointment.A meat thermometer is useless without the numbers indicating the temperature."
0,"Kill me now If you are going to watch this movie for any reason, watch it for the dancing. just be ready to have your remote in hand to fast forward through everything else. Because everything else is COMPLETE garbage. Ive read about how some of the fights in the movie between the dance team were actually real fights, and instead of making me think oh wow, it makes it so authentic, all I can think is How horribly unprofessional. I mean really, the actors cant even control their rage while shooting a movie? Thats the kind of stuff you see happening on a high school campus, not on a movie set.Amazon asked me Under ?, and for a reason. I have a feeling this movie can only be tolerated by children  and under, and anybody who enjoyed it who is older, well, I dont know what to say."
0,"Too Much Filler Very Little Substance  of this book is filler material  the st  chapters gives general overviews about STM, the Appendix is like the last  of the book. Absolutely zero coverage on how to implement custom parser functionality needed if you have a device that doesnt have builtin support under MARS. Useful only as a basic starting point reference, but not worth the price tag. Indicates that another book on MARS will be produced  maybe that is why the content has been watered down."
0,Extremely revolting! I have read several Dean Koontz books and I can truthfully say that I have liked all of them except maybe Fear Nothing. Then this book had to come along. First off it was way too long. Several sections could have been lopped off especially the longwinded part when Spencer was in a mad river huddled in his car. And secondly what made me squirm was towards the end when one of the characters has sex with her own father! And he likes it! This is disgusting in its filth and beyond depraved. ...What is this world coming too?

For instance, hes not a huge fan of the Nylabones durachews cause theyre so tough I think he likes to feel like hes getting something out of chewing. He kind of likes Kongs, but not that much, unless they have peanut butter in them.A lot of people wrote about how durable this thing was, but in my experience, its not at all. After about  minutes with it, hed already chewed through a piece of it, so I took it away from him. The only thing that was going to happen after that was that he would start tearing off pieces and chewing on them, just like hes done before to other toys. Guess Ill just keep looking out for a durable rubber toy that hell actually chew on."

0,"An album destroyed by a managers iron fist. The Clash were the greatest rock band ever to play on a stage. Their songs, albums and general outview on society have influenced countless amounts of bands from U to Rancid. However, this album very ironically titled was a major blemish on The Clashs nearperfect musical record. Mick Jones was ousted in  and the new members went about carrying on The Clashs early sound, playing live shows that emphasised volume and speed  a way The Clash hadnt played since . Cut The Crap was removed from Joe Strummers hands after the demo stage and completely ruined the album with electronic drums, outofplace samples and mob vocals. Because of a egotistical and nutty manager, The Clashs good name was blemished forever. I recommend that you have a listen to the postJonesHeadon Clash, but dont get this album. Get your hands on a bootleg from  instead."
0,"A Powerful Lemon Yes, its a powerful piece of machinery for the price. Video editing, AutoCAD, basic Mental Ray renders in Alias Maya, highdemand games this computer could do it. Then, three months out of the box, the display went dead. Poof! The nice man at tech support told me Id have to ship it to the States Im in the UK on business for five months to get it serviced. Great! Shortly after that conversation, the main fan started rattling. So now I have a heavy, very noisy laptop connected to a monitor. Desktop replacement indeed.Seriously, this thing can do what you want it to do its beefy. The Cool and Quiet Technology is interesting to see in operation. But it feels cheeply made. The plastic body seems ready to crack at any moment.Good computing for the price, but poorly executed. Tethered to a monitor, unable to bring the computer to meetings and such, I cant help but regret the purchase."
0,"bugggy! I bought this game thinking that it looked good, I tried playing it on my mhz windows  and it kept freezing up. the sound was awful, although you can change the music during gameplay which was a cool feature, the music stinks! The gameplay consisted of mindless violence that went nowhere! No plot, no story. The game had a couple of buggs that Rockstar should have wored out before marketing this one. I would not buy it again if I had a choice. Buy Max Payne instead, now that game Rocks!"
0,"do not buy! I tried to hook up this KVM switch and struggled with the cable placement like everyone else talked about. And then powered it on and it started beeping. I had a wired keyboard and mouse plugged in. Didnt matter, still beeped. So I double checked my cables, and still it beeped. Then I switched the mouse to the keyboard side and it stopped beeping, however the computer now interpreted the mouse movements as keystrokes and every move of the mouse would type jibberish into any available text box. So now I have a nd mouse plugged into the keyboard port to stop the beeping and my main mouse is plugged into one of the alternate device ports. This product is so incredibly bad.

0,"This book was horrible, even for first year teachers I will be a first year Bio teacher this fall and so I went ahead and bought this book. In addition to the poor layout, the first  pages were useless. The only good thing about it was the sponge activities in the back of the book but even then I would probably only use them when we have a sub or as a fun activity to fill time. Going back to the layout, the author would put page after page of forms or examples in the MIDDLE of explaining what was going on. For example, you would start to read about a technique, or whatever, and then its  pages of example forms some related to what you just read, others related to something else, and then it would go back to discussing the technique.Everything else in the book was common sense and taught in my graduate teaching courses and my grad classes taught it much better.I wouldnt suggest this book to anyone."
0,"Not the item in the picture!! I wanted the item in the picture with the deep nylon pockets to hold the water bottle.

Within two weeks, the buttons started popping in and out of the machine and the machine would randomly freeze.

0,Uncensored my foot In big letters on the back at the top it says Uncensored and Outrageous and in the small print describing the special features it says on select episodes. This is annoying and misleading. I want the uncensored version of each episode! Also annoying is that half the episodes are full screen and half are wide. This show is still great but this collection seems like an uneven thrown together hodgepodge.

Dont waste yours on it either. Im sure there is probably another product out there that will work better.

0,"Not the best quality If you go online and look up the artist C.

I guess this isnt a bad price, but if you want a copy of the real drawing, you can probably find one at a similar price."
0,Bad ending ruined the whole movie. I thought this sounded like a good movie so I went and rented it. It was good up until the ending scene. It made me sad and pissed off all at the same time.

If you plan to watch this movie please rent it before you spend the  bucks buying it.

Instead, since this book was released, the chiropractic profession has grown tremendously and is taught and practiced all over the world. Today, many medical doctors are treated by chiropractors. Furthermore, many medical doctors and chiropractors share practices. You be the judge."
0,Not Durable The light source is the main problem wthis toy. The light quality to project is poor at best and on the learn to draw discs red ones  just move anything a millimeter and your artist will be howling because now the entire picture is out of focus and you have to jiggle it back in place to get the same size so you can finish the picture. Its not worth  maybe  at best.
0,"Waldorf and Statler would have a field day with this one! How could they do this to the Muppets?!?! I was overjoyed when I heard of the Muppet game, but sadly I shouldnt have been. This is one of the worst games for the GBC. The control is awful, the graphics are barely passable and the characters look nothing like their normal selves. Kermit and Animal are so tiny that you cant make out any body language. Theyre just green and red blobs moving about. The music is really awful too. When it boots up the music is barely audible, then once the game starts you get a repettive bore of a score. Dont even mention the story line and action of the game itself. Its just all so basic and executed so poorly. The Muppets hold so much promise for a terrific game and to see it wasted is painful. All we can do now is hope for a better effort on the Game Boy Advance."
0,"One of the worst movies of all time Bokeem Woodbine did good work in THE BIG HIT, DEAD PRESIDENTS  GRIDLOCKD but after them he has only done crap, besides his movie NEW BREED these is his worst...Its actually one of the worst movies of all time, and who was the guy who named it BLACK MALE? Bokeems race has nuthin to do with the movie, and the big role is played buy an unknown British actor whos about as good as Steven Segal at acting...Lousy script, everything sucks!"
0,"Mediocre To be fair, I havent finished this novel. Its not as if I have no free time, I do I just couldnt stay interested in the characters at all. Chapters here and there are wellwritten and drew me in, but the overall quest of the main character is boring and cliched, and there is nothing in the novel to make me like him. Right now I have no real reason to want to finish the book, other than to fill up moments of sheer boredom."
0,"Not What A Paint Technique Should Be Aside from the out of date, cheesy and lame styles that are in the book, the techniques are very general and dont really teach you how to do them. Dont waste your time."
0,"Great content, terrible delivery I was thrilled to see this release. These were historic games even if youre not a die hard Giants fan, as I am and the ability to keep them forever was fantastic. However and it is a HUGE however when they arrived and I played the first DVD I was surprised to see that the set I received was in oldstyle  video format remember the square screen tvs of the th century? So I contacted Amazon thinking I ordered the wrong format, yet was blown away to find out that this is the only was it was released!!! Come on now, you cant buy a  screen TV anymore, EVERYTHING is WIDESCREEN! WHY RELEASE THE MOST EPIC SERIES OF SPORTS EVENTS IN ???? The games were even recorded in widescreen! They INTENTIONALLY crippled them.I returned the set. Disgusted."
0,Very Poor Quality. Purchased for my wife. Tried to carefully remove the module to install the batteries and the outter portion began to break. The product is not physically designed to work like it is suppose to. This was as waste of money and I would not recommend it to anyone.thank you
0,"Simple Totally uninspired. They put Radiohead to a string quartet but theres no personality to it, theyve just drained Yorkes voice away and replaced it with a replica on strings. If only they had brought their own vision to the work instead of trying to reproduce it on different instruments. To coin a phrase there aint nothin like the real thing."
0,teambuilding  not I am not the least satisfied with this book. I think the exercises in it are lame. I was hoping for several ideas to perform in the office over the next  months but honestly I cannot find ONE worthy of trying! Im sorry to say that this book is a complete waste of money and time.
0,Not classic Ludlum! starts quite well but needs to be about  pages shorter. I got very bored whilst reading this book which is a first for me whilst reading a Ludlum book and its much too predictable.
0,The Time Machine I think due to the age of the book it was very hard to hold my interest in the story. Actually the best part of the book is the last  or  pages. I wont reveal any of that in case you really want to read it.
0,"Youve got to be kidding me!!! I picked up the first Wheel of Time book back in . Book after book, I have been astounded by what Robert Jordan is able to accomplish with a pen and paper. The Path of Daggers, however, is quite possibly the worst Wheel of Time book ever. Except for a few interesting developments with the Ashaman, nothing happens in this book. You could have read Crown of Swords, then skipped the first  pages or so of The Path of Daggers without skipping a beat. The next one better be good, but we wont know for another  years!!"
0,"Terrible This film was absolutely terrible, apart from the shrimps, i couldnt stand it, it does not have a patch on the shrek films, or any of the pixar films. Truly terrible, a rip off of finding nemo, but not a very good one."
0,"Old plot  The action scenes could not exploit the skills of the stars  The action scenes could not exploit the skills of the stars. For example the fighting between Jet Li and Dolph Lundgren was a big disappointment. Its too dark. I could hardly see anything. The plot has been repeated multiple times before. In short, its a waste of all the talents of all the stars such as Stallone, Jet Li, and Dolph Lundgren, Jason Statham"
0,Cheap dvds We have  dvds players and some times they will work in one. The next day they wont work in that one but will work in another one. One time we stopped it in the middle of the dvd and came back to rewatch it an hour later and it said invalid disk. We hadnt even taken it out of the player and could not get it work. Its not our dvd players because it does not do this with other dvds.
0,DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM This TV is garbage...the warranty is ony valid for  days. my kids tv is barely  months old and it is all messed up. It turns off by itself after a few seconds. Disney Tech support will offer me a list of places to ship the thing to be fixed...ALL AT MY COST. So now I have a nice  paper weight. Do not waste your money. the cuteness is not worth the hassle.

0,"Doesnt work with the latest iPods I ordered these headphones with great anticipation. I had read a review of them in PC Magazine, and thought they would be the perfect solution for my work music needs... I move around a lot in a large cube, and like to leave my iPod on the desk.Imagine my disappointment when I got the headphones, only to discover that they will not work with either iPod I own  an iPod Nano and a GB Video iPod. These headphones only work with the older type of iPod that has a little extra plug next to the headphone jack.I was able to use them  sound only, no controls  by plugging in the included extension cable. But since the main reason I wanted these was to be able to pause and unpause music directly from the headphones, I reluctantly sent them back.So  fair warning to owners of the newest iPod models These dont work. Wait until Logitech comes out with a revised model."
0,"Lured in by Judith, lulled by the rest... After hearing Judith and The Hollow, I was sure that I was going to love this recording. Well, I have to be honest and tell you that those two are NOT representative of the rest of the release. Judith was a great move for the first singleas its aggression and power will have most Tool and Maynard fans running crazed to the record store. The rest is a collection of immaculatelyrecorded, hugesounding and averagetoboring songs. I have listened and listend to Mer De Nomsand can find no reason besides the two I bought it for to continue listening further. Be warned..."
0,"HOHUM REPEAT REPEAT REPEAT I read this book hoping it would be interesting, and for the first chapter it was, but it was the following chapters that bored me to death, the reason I say this is due to the fact that every chapter is a repeat of the previous chapter, you learn how Tim did things his way over and over and over again. Fortunately, this book did leave out for the most part, the I love Faith, I love Faith syndrome that Tim has been going through over the past. The book is a nice have if you want it just to have it, if youre looking for a good read on country music, try one of the older books on Waylon, Willie, Merle, or anyone that has actually had something to say."
0,"Poor Quality, I was expecting more. The problem with this book is that the author seemed to take the exact questions from his Oracle  practice tests and copy them into this book. I even saw numerous questions that said In Oracle... shouldnt it say i?There is a reason Oracle i has its own set of tests, there are new features and addeddeleted objectives. Case in point, in the first Network Administration practice exam there are about  or  questions on Oracle Intelligent Agent. Unfortunately Oracle Intelligent Agent is not covered on the actual i exam. Also I found two or three questions in the practice exam that were dead wrong. All this in just  minutes of reviewing the book in the store.I dont recommend this book to anyone that is serious about getting their OCP. Stick with the Sybex books and the STS examsif you really need the extra practice. I did all my studying with just the Sybex books. Good Luck."
0,"give us all a break Its disturbing to find such a shameless and shoddy imitative work on the library shelf. Kelly borrows the Junie B. Jones series kiddie grammar and at times cloying voice, without any of its redemptive humor, insight and characterization."
0,"How do I give no stars Rhino and Atlantic should hang their heads in shame. I just finished listening to this CD that I unfortunately wasted my money on. While there are a few good selections on it, most are a waste and disrespectful to a true genius. When I got to the final selection, America the Beautiful, a song that Ray Charles made his own many years ago, I almost threw up. What a travesty to the beauty that he brought to this song and to the memory of one of the true geniuses of American music. Again, Rhino and Atlantic  hang your heads to try to profit off trash like this."
0,"MTV fans like it, real fans dont For some bands this would be a very solid album. All the blink  wannabes would make their quick buck releasing an album like this. Its full of simple and catchy melodies that are easy to sing along to. Sounds good, right? The problem is that No Use For A Name has been in the scene almost as long as anyone, releasing quality punk rock the whole time. After all that it is an insult to release an album so watered down with shallow lyrics. Dont get me wrong, I do listen to this and enjoy it. But I can find the same enjoyment from the riddlin kids, bowling for soup, or simple plan. Atleast those bands are being themselves. Who knows? Maybe times were tough for NUFAN and they needed a quick buck. But when I put in a record from a veteran punk rock band I want to hear some real punk rock. This was a disappointment."
0,"Caveat emptor While Dungeon Lords is on shelves, it is unfinished. I dont mean the usual unforeseen minor bugs and occasional quirks. I mean Dreamcatcher has, quite deliberately, released a game that is a minimum of  months of intense work away from being a viable product. Some of the features didnt work from the CD install, so Dreamcatcher REMOVED them in a patch. Other features such as the map are documented, but STILL not implemented.The bugs are too numerous to catalogue here, but they are gamebreaking. The issues are too severe for Dreamcatcher to not have known this product is nowhere close to completion, much less ready for retail. So I must urge the reader DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT."
0,"Dont read the beginning or the end. This author actually believes that she can tell you all about your life just by what age you are and she can predict what kind of story you will write, just by knowing your age. Wrong! There is also an entire section telling to basically quit your job, ignore your loved ones and devote yourself fully to becoming a millionare writing in Hollywood which in reality, most of you will never make a penny doing. This book is entirely unrealistic, but not because of the premise of the title.What I do like about this book is she pushes you to quit procrastinating, gives good writing exercises, and gives you your basic outline without being too specific. Not really the book I was looking for."
0,"Emo happened in   Its over now Yea, so heres another upandcoming group, Taking Back Sunday. Ok, who had it? People, arent you catching on yet? One lame band makes a record how? I have no idea, and another band sees the popular response to it, and light bulbs go off. Hey we can do that. Thats what youre getting here. This needs to stop. If youre not a musician, stay out of the studio because kids hear it and dont know any better. Theyve gotta have something in the CD player of the sports car that daddy bought for them. Bravo music video corporation! Theyve successfully marketed a mediocre sound as something more than than. If this kind of stuff moves you, I just dont know."
0,"Shamms is universally despised with good reason! If you have even the slightest experience with computer graphics you will find this book like all the R. Shamms Mortimer books to be useless! Not only does he appear to have no real skill with the product his examples consist of page after page of mindless repetition. Ex heres how to make a man with a fish head, and now heres how to make a man with a dog head, and now heres how to make a man with a horse head, etc, ad nauseam. Instead of giving master advice on how to make the most of this tool as part of a greater software toolkit Shamms simply plugs pieces together mindlessly and passes them off as lessons. There are maybe ten useful pages in the book and ALL of them are almost directly from the Poser manual. Avoid this book at all costs."
0,"pressing issues When I hear my university colleagues condemn vanity presses, I often object, and I do so because of books like The Parthenon Code. Surely hobbyists such as Mr Johnson deserve an avenue for presenting their work to the public. The rigorous review to which juried publications are subjected demands, perhaps, an unnecessarily burdensome familiarity with scholarship in the appropriate fields of study, to say nothing of a careers worth of work in the academy and environs. My only regret for this book is that Mr Johnson has not yet quite mastered the conventions of scholarly discourse, where  in the words of the great Dorothy L Sayers  a bland and deadly courtesy is more devastating than rudely deriding the works of scholars who have devoted their lives to the formal study, teaching, and illumination of, in this case, the classics and the Bible."
0,"a positivistic slant This text is a text it looks and reads like one, which limits its audience. It also struck me as partial, with a positivistic slant, and, even though originally published in , oddly outdated. The index has no listing under Vygotsky, a major oversight, I would think in a text on learning, since todays journals, at least in the area of literacy, repeatedly refer to his ideas and influence."
0,"vs.  It is interesting to read the other customer reviews and see how some can actually see this version  as the better of the two or really any good at all. I was not aware of the  version and cought this version  on television and thought it was mildly interesting. Then I watched the  DutchFrench version and was really sorry that I had even seen the  version first. It totally ruins the interesting way the story weaves  and the way the  version ends is just so perfectly Hollywood, it makes me want to lose it. Whereas, the  version ends perfectly cold. I would like to know why in the world Sluzier would remake his own great movie and make it into a bad Hollywood film?!?!?"

0,Even the crickets were sleeping I love romances and the cover is more intriguing than the story. The readers have to work through all the mire of information about the characters lives which didnt interest me enough to finish the book. There are very few books that I have left unfinished but I am sorry to say I just couldnt go on.
0,"An insult to rock. Keep out of my genre, grandpa!This guy thinks he can come in, take respected rock songs and go hey, I can make this soooo much better if I convert this into my genre! Fat chance. He murdered Smells Like Teen Spirit because he knew nothing about the song. He merely read a lyrics sheet. The song is all about teenage angst, anger and depression. Its full of emotion. He takes it and reads the lyrics slowly while a jazz band plays in the background. This means that he turned the song into an empty shell. The lyrics meant nothing because HE didnt know what they meant.Others such as Jump are exactly the same.Dont buy this. Get the actual songs or, if you were looking for a parody, buy Wierd Al Yankovic!"

0,"Careful with play gym attachment! The play gym cross bar baby Einstein attachment on this product collapsed on my  month old! I had used it before with no problems and thought I was careful in putting it up but the clips keeping it on must have come undone and it collapsed on her. She was not hurt, but could have been if the heaviest part had falled on her. I actually like the regular pack and play part of this very much  easy to put up, relatively light, nice primary colors  and will continue to use that but I will not use the baby Einsten attachment anymore."

0,"Please dont ruin a great book A fan of Pride and Prejudice may be reeled in by the quirky description of this movie, but do not be fooled. Anyone one who claims to love the story as much as the main character does would not allow the foibles to take place. Jane and Collins get married??? If she were as big a fan as she claims to be she would have taken a bullet before that happened. The first half of the movie I enjoyed it but then it goes quickly downhill. Send Elizabeth back, have Michael make a proposal scene worth her acceptance, but please oh please dont make another movie like this one."
0,"Horrible I was looking forward to getting a chance to play the game. When I first played it it was alright. I then noticed bugs. There are so many of them. When you save a game it sometimes loads instead of saving and locks the game up. Also you always have to keep a savefile when you are selecting your crew and ships. The reason for this is after you start your mission there is no way to go back and change your crew or your ship selection. I also found out that you cant control your ships fire. The computer atomatialy controls it unlike kilgon acdemy in, which you basicaly control everything. I was very disappointed about this game and I dont recomend it to anyone."
0,Do not buy if you have more than  DVDs to store This seems like a nice case until you start putting the DVDs in. After about  they pinch together so much at the back you cannot easily close the case to zip it. I did get  in there but I had to squeeze it together so hard I was afraid of damaging the DVDs. Im sure they would warp if I left it closed that way. Amazon was great of course and refunded my money.

0,"CreamTired Giants Its really sad to see these guys just going through the motions. Nothing in this DVD set or the associated CD set even comes close to the old Cream recordings from the s. The most glaring and obvious example of this is Crossroads. Compared to the classic Wheels of Fire version, this new recording is yawn inspiring. Eric Clapton and Jack Bruce seem to have a hard time getting interested. All of the intricate interplay between guitar and bass on the earlier recording are just a memory. I guess that either Jack Bruce or Ginger Baker or both of them were running short on cash. If you want the real thing, skip this depressing effort and find a copy of Wheels of Fire."

I am seriously unhappy with this purchase. It doesnt matter how well this item works if it cant stand up to normal use! The blades of the fan snap off, rendering the pad useless. CHEAP MATERIALS! EDIT OK I exchanged my laptop pad AGAIN and it broke after about  hours of use. That is THREE of these cheap things!! This time I am getting my money back. And using it to invest in a better cooling pad, I think, because I really could use one that actually works."
0,"Save this disc for when you are in a silly mood Cher is bigger than the writing on most of her hits. She is a genuine charismatic performer.

0,"Absolutely horrible movie I watched this movie originally due to Ellen Page, who is one of my favorite actresses. This movie was the worst feature I have seen in a long time. Ellens character goes on some sort of crusade to torture a pedo including castration. Her character goes from bad to worse as the movie goes on. As always, she does an amazing job in the roll however by the end of it you hope the man who was supposed to be the villian will win. Most movies I buy I buy with the intention of watching more than one time. However, the one time I watched this was quite enough, and I truly could not make it through it again. Thank God Ellen has moved on in her career because this film could have truly damaged it."

0,"The Worst Book I Have Ever Read Now, to be honest I found the first  of this novel very engaging if not somewhat naive, but then I arrived at the last part, A is A, and everything went downhill fast. I expected an incredile conclusion full of action and adventure, maybe a trainrobbing scene with pistol shooting and car jumping or a huge civil war in the valley among all the creators, but all I found were shallow characters spouting off a bunch of dull endless monologues, the majority of which seemed to imply that being a greedy selfish jerk  sorry, a selfactualized person  is the most moral path a person can take. In the end the good guys willingly let millions of innocent people suffer and starve to death for the sake of their muddled contradictory principles. I found nothing redeeming about this book except that it makes a great paperweight and works well for smashing house spiders. Cheers"

I dont understand why it it not metal because that little nub of plastic is the only thing that holds the outside juicer attachment in place. Mine just sheared completely off during the nd use.

0,"novelty I bought two of these for my kids pocket V.Smiles. When they arrived, the kids were very EXCITED. I wasnt so much. For the price, you get what you pay for but the sections to hold the cartrige, dont actually fit the cartidge on one side because the divider have been sewn in the wrong place. It only fits two games, we also have headphones, if you put in the cords for the TV or car charger, the head phones dont fit. After seeing these, I took one of the linch boxes and found that they are almost the same size but the lunch box fit the v.smile, all the gaes, headphones and car charger with room to spare. Now Im wishing Id got them lunchboxes!"
0,"Didnt even bother going from cassette to cd on this one Ive been a fan of Exodus since the beginning and I am even a fan of the newer Exodus releases. I had the cassette tape at one point back when it came out and got rid of it eventually. With so many great releases by this band I wouldnt even bother with this one. It sounds like thrash lite or thrash by numbers...and some of it is just not thrashy. There doesnt seem to be any energy to the songs. Garys great riffs and crunchy sound are there, but not served in a manner that I care for. Also, when Zetro tries to sing it gets awkward and unlistenable. Im amazed that more people arent ragging on this release although not too many are praising it either, most people probably just ignore it!There is a reason that Exodus never plays ANY of these songs in their shows. Think about that."
0,"AWFULDEFECTIVE Window Shrink!!! We purchased three  boxes of the Duck Brand Window shrink. Though we have used this product in the past, we believe we received three defective boxes from the retailer who sold us these on Amazon. We have used this brand for the past four years. This time, all the plastic pulled away from the tape. Obviously there was a problem with his batch and it is sad that it was sold to us. We had to rebuy all new plastic after having put it all up in our entire lower level. We will never buy this product from Amazon again nor anything from the seller!!!! No Good!!! This deserves zero stars for a rating!!!"
0,"Not your sweet Grandma Humor and beauty? Rebellious, cynical, and depressing seem to me to describe these selections more accurately. Oh, I suppose a few of them are all right. But this is definitely not like the light stuff my grandma found so appealing in Erma Bombeck. After reading about half a dozen of these pieces, Id had quite enough, thank you."

0,"Looks good, works cheap Sorry everyone, I really wanted to rate this high, ... It came with no antenna, standard. Without an antenna, it picks up few neighboring countie warnings, and lousy radio reception. The radio stinks, sounds cheap, like a ...  transistor I had  yrs ago. Hard to program I work with computers, hard to operate. The alarm works half the time, probably due to no antenna. Save your money."
0,disappointing I have seen a couple of the Jeff Dunham shows this one did not live up to my or my husbands expectations. I was so excited about receiving the CD that I invited people over to see it. You could actually hear the lack of laughter.
0,"Cuts off in midsong, hard to get working. Im not sure if this is a product issue, or due to the shipping, but it turns itself off with just the slightest bump. I only brought it because we arent allowed to have our mp players at work but are allowed to have a cd player. If youll looking for something like that, cheapper isnt better, go with something a little better if youll looking for something more long term and can getuse a MP player, do the research and get a MP player that fits youll needs."
0,"Bo DVD Although Fumio Demura is a legend, this DVD does not do him justice. Buy his book. The book BO  a karate weapon of self defense is much better. The worst part of the DVD is that there is no section breaks scene selection where you can skip to the next scene. For better instruction get the DVD from Turtle Press Jang Bong Fundamentals  Patterns DVD or even the chinese staff dvds they teach you more."

0,"Dont waste your money We used our previous spacesaver BD coffee maker for maybe  years  loved it with glass carafe. I bought the new one  have only been using it a week  hate it. If our old one wasnt just flat worn out, we would still be using it.I concur with all the other reviews I have read. Why go  change all the features that seemed to be working for something that is a total inconvenience. Im very disappointed in my choice. I would have thought better from Black  Decker. If I could return this product TODAY, I would, but unfortunately I purchased it in another city, which would cost me even more to return it. So Im stuck with this Albatross of a coffee maker."
0,Simply does not work... Santa brought this for my daughter this year and unfortunately it does not work. When the USB device is plugged into the computer a web browser is opened and directed to a page not found error. I tried it on several computers using Firefox and IE to no avail. After some research it seems were not the only one having this issue. Its sad to think how many children will be getting this for Christmas only to find out that it doesnt work.
0,"Math isnt for infants, but this book is I removed this from its envelope and gasped when I realized it was only the cover  the entire mass of bound pages had fallen out. Used books rock. After I remedied this with Elmers Glue, I set out on a mathematical journey. Except it wasnt very mathematical, this thing is really colorful and childish. I believe Prentice Hall has a penchant for publishing the most ridiculous, simplified drivel. Most of the pages are taken up by these erroneous rambling storybook things that go way out on a tangent. Yes, theyre Excursions but they dont have to be so mindless. Maybe Im just taking the wrong math class. Ill try College Algebra with a different book next year."
0,"Grooming spray for tangles I was hoping to find a product that would make brushing easier and less tangled. I have a toy poodle. This product didnt do that but it had a nice fresh smell. I love the way she smells naturally so wasnt too keen on having a spray that had a scent but this scent was okay, not too much or overpowering. My groomer told me to use dog conditioner on her while bathing and that has worked very well for the tangles. This product just didnt work the way I had hoped."
0,"A poor recap of other Kelly work This is a brief recap of other Kelly work. There are several other better, cheaper, larger books that do this, often with much additional information.

0,"A CD that is Covered With Sores I cant believe people waste and ruin their lives on this garbage. And I thought Slipknot was terrible. I might as well form a goremetal band and hire an amatuer drummer, two guitarists who know about maybe two or three chords, and an average bassist. As a vocalist, I will write gross, sick, and perverted lyrics, and make silly grunts, grumbles, and gurgling noises while saying only half the lyrics. As a band, we will write sick and repulsive subject matter just to shock the public and make people feel sick, make gross and graphic cover artespecially horrible ones agianst women to do just the same, make nothing but sick noise instead of music, and send violent messeges through our music in order for our fans and listeners to commit all sorts of acts of violence, and walla! You have another goremetal band just like Cannibal Corpse. And dont forget another school shooting."

0,"A book with no meaning The silly story and pictures are clearly influenced by Dr. Seuss, but since theres no meaning or point to the story, it completely fails to copy any of the quality of a Seuss book. When the author couldnt think of a meaningful rhyme, he just picked things out of thin air like talking about an odd sock wood being A place where goblins And ogres meet To talk about socks and Wiffy feet! The book appears to be a missmosh of unrelated nonsense poems done by a child and strung together without thought. My  year old boy found this whole book meaningless. Maybe a child of  or  might find the nonsense amusing, but unfortunately there are a sufficient number of complicated words e.g. vaguely,meringue,absurd that would surely bore that age group. Im not sure how this book got published. Dont waste your money."
0,"Be Ever Hopeful, Hannalee I actually had to be forced to read this book ten pages at a time in english class two years ago. I LOVE reading and LOVE history, but couldnt get into this book.

Then, after so many complaints, they did some serious and effective problem shooting.It looks like the same ugly problem is back.When they work, Verbatim discs are the best. These discs are a bad return to the days of errorridden production.Avoid and look for other media for storage."
0,"The most biased book, Ive ever read. I am taking a class where this book is required. It takes no time at all to realize that the author has a hate america agenda. The source information is pretty good, however, its how he interprets....The worst being that he described one of the most influential men in american history, as a rich white guy....That would be Benjamin Franklin. Thats all Zinn had to say about this founding father. After this, I had no respect for any ideas this self admitted anarchist, had to say."

0,"The Next Generation with a notso Next generation quality We were really bouyed with our last purchase of the Star Trek, TOS, but the Next generation packaging has totally let us down. Displeasure clearly emanates from following reasons Disc seperators of very poor quality and starts breaking even if you try to open to retrieve the DVD, in fact some of them had gaping holes immediately after opening the package Picture quality higly mediocre and hazy, gives impression of a shoddy job of DVD conversion some discs have starting trouble and they stop at some places Sound quality averageOverall package is dissappointing and clearly not worth the premium that is charged,"
0,"A missed chance Faith is obviusly looking to be recognised as a great singer not just a Country singer. The problem for me is very much as the first couple of reviews mentioned. This album is over produced and detracts from the great voice Faith has. She does not need all of that and I think that is why her earlier recordings allowed the voice to be centre stage.I would be very careful before I bought another of her albums if this is an example of where she is going, especially with the price of CDs in the UK"
0,s video on DVD The quality is very poor on this video.The use of Elmos name is simply to sell it as he does not appear in the actual skits. He introduces them and thats it.I would save my money and buy an Actual Elmo video.
0,"What a mess! I used to own this thing, or should I say Beast. The concept is great Precisely measured grounds from pottopot. However, what you dont see on the box is the mess it makes when you pull out the plastic receptacle. Grounds spray out when the lid is removed. More grounds fall out when you try to dump them into the coffee maker. Add to that the fact that you have to tap on the bottom because the oils in the coffee cause it to clump along the sides. Its even worse in the winter when its dry with a lot of static. Coffee goes everywhere. Its more mess than its worth."
0,"Straitforward, trivial variation on the theme of Psycho This unbelievably boring, uninventive thriller that borrows too much from Hitchcocks Psycho shower murders, double identity of the killer, death of the main heroine, etc. is quite possibly Brian De Palmas worst movie that I have seen so far."
0,"Very Dissapointing! Ranges from poor to mediocre, nothing great. Some Repeats. As owner of Every single ChillLounge music CD I am aware of, this was the biggest dissapointment in a long time. Chillout  thru Chillout  was very good in comparison. This CD is not a complete disaster, however, I could not find one song worthy of a  star rating. Quite a few  star songs however, lots of  star songs. Some of the better songs were repeated on older Chill discs or present on other series of lounge discs.I think the people that rated this  or  stars dont own a lot of loungechill and are probably a lot easier to please. Im very dissapointed. Maybe this genre is all dried up!  Oh well...I highly recomend any of the CDs in this set before this one. In fact, Chillout sessions  was SUPERB!!!"
0,"Losers! I cannot believe someone in this world spent hisher money producing this piece of junk. The show was awful although hilarious! why do anyone wants to buy this horrible CD?

This is sad as in pathetic. The world is definitely ending. Hahahaha!!!"
0,"Looks nice, but hard to use After reading through all of the comments here, I cautioned my father about the threads breaking and the knob falling off. We live in AZ and its almost October here, so the temps arent as high as they typically are. It kept the inside cooler and looked nice, but it wadded up when we got in the car to go somewhere. We spent quite a bit of time straightening out the pleats while trying to not break the thin nylon string that enables it to fold. We had to actually start the car and turn on the AC because by the time we got it folded back up, the car had become hot. I wouldnt buy this product again."

0,"Dont buy. Doesnt work. First, one needs to understand that this antenna is just a windup cable that is  feet  meters long. Its nothing else whatsoever.So where does laying out a  feet cable qualify as an antenna? Ans no one can say for sure. You may get a boosted signal, you may get nothing. You wont even know if the cable has broken internally due to pulling on it to hard.Its also extremely annoying to wind and unwind  just pulling doesnt unwind it  you need to manually unwind and the wind it again.What a joke."
0,"An arrogant jerk! After having the misfortune of buying this book? and reading the first paragraph I had to toss my cookies. The author comes across as a totally arrogant jerk.

0,"Confused and Mental This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The only good acting in the entire movie was Seth Green, who was really good. The other actors were stiff and who could blame them. The dialogue was unreal. I mean NO ONE talks like that! The plot was ridiculously thin and confusing. The director tried for deep and meaningful with funky shots and sequences but never made it. There was never a resolution to any question brought up in the film. Why was this happening to the lead character? I dont know. Why was he trying to perform this ceremony? I dont know. How did it go wrong? I dont know. What was the point to anything? I dont know? What happened to him or his nemesis at the end of the film? I dont know! I was bored silly by the movie and I really wanted to like it."

0,Cheap I was looking for a cheap breadboard and I guess this fit the bill. When it arrived the box holding the precut wire was broken. The wires were all mixed together and many bent. The top right corner of the breadboard assembly itself was bent out of shape. The banana plug connectors were not installed and if I didnt have the tools it would have been difficult to unscrew the nut from one connector to be able to install it on the breadboard assembly.Ive got the wires organized now. The connectors installed. The rubber feet stuck on. I need to get some super glue to fix the wire box. Hopefully the breadboard itself has more quality and I can afford to pay for a better product when it needs to be replaced.

0,"Ban this this film isnt scary, it isnt well written or shot well. I agree with some of the other reviewers that the scenery stole the show. The house and surrounding countryside are both beautiful and unnerving. The story itself, twins returning to mother russia to figure out what happened to thier murdered mother and what secrets lie in the house, never quite reached a level of clarity and i found myself quite bored with its momentum.To tell a horror story right, even without a clear ending, you have to be able to spin its details in a way where the viewer cant tear thier eyes away and where the characters at least are interesting. This didnt achieve any of that in my opinion. It ended and I was just angry that i wasted my time."
0,"A frustrating read. I just want to reiterate the reader review titled So much potential, so poorly realized. This could have been a good book, but the author does get out of her own way.Frustrating and disappointing."
0,"Hmmm... Disappointing...Its a good album in its own right, but its not anything near what i would expect from the Hopesfall i knew previously. It has several good songs, and nothing is particularly awful about it, it is just so mediocre and samey and just not the kind of development or even same level of music as i hoped these guys would produce with their new album. If youre a hopesfall fan thinking of buying it and hoping for something as exciting, unique and downright interesting as The Satellite Years i wouldnt bother."
0,"shirt was aweful This costume was a good price however, the gauze style shirt was aweful. I ended up buying something else last minute. So much for the general sizing. I am  and  lbs. I generally wear a small to medium. This shirt was so small it would fit a child. The elastic was super tight. In addition, the vest was so cheaply made I threw it away after one wearing. It barely held up for the occassion. The skirt, however, was comfortable and fit well. I realize it is just a costume, but nothing like being uncomfortable all night at a fun party. I would not recommend this costume."

I was expecting a clear, hopefully letterboxed, DVD along the lines of the wonderful Margaret Rutherford Miss Marple DVDs. This DVD presents a barely visable picture  murky and blurry. A major disappointment. Please dont miss an opportunity to see this film, but dont bother with this disaster of a DVD, since you wont be able to see the film.I wish that I had heeded Mr. Murphys review which is  accurate."

Though I could do without all the nanananana background over the last minute or so.And beyond that, there is not a single thing on this CD worth hearing, relentless mediocrity, as if one were trapped on the state fair circuit, hearing bighaired bands from the s eternally playing their semihits while roller coaster and dodge em cars add to the aural clutter.Two stars for one miracle of brilliance."

I have had more dropped calls with this phone than with any other tmobile phone I have ever had  it even drops calls when I have a signal and have not moved. People can hardly ever hear what I am saying. To add to this the other day it turned itself off and would not turn on for over a day. I have had to go back to using my old phone after a few months because I could not rely on this phone to work or stay turned on.
0,"cooning on camera While some people still wonder where Waldo might be, others might wonder where and why Ice Cube turned out the way he did. Instead of evolving in music, culture and film he turned his focus onto sophomoric humor and bombastic slapstick with we are the world dialogue that adds up to nothing but a neoversion of Birth of a Nation. All the cardboard characters in Barber Shop get crafted into stereotypes that do not add up to much but minimal spurts of bathroom humor. Ice Cube weaves in and out of serious topics about ownership, realestate, white collar crime and Anglo fantasies but these addressed get redressed and celebrated for their errors and mistakes. In my conclusion, there is no redemption to the immoral of the story. Nothing here is worth the price for this dvd. I would suggest Spike Lees WE CUT HEADS film  as a real, funny, sad, contemplative, sophisticated film that captures the essence that is lacking in this lackeys flick!"

0,"Disappointing This was not in the same class as the first two Mummy films. The story line was decent but the acting was poor. The chemistry was missing between the actors and it was very disappointing.They need to find the first Evie and bring her back. She added much to the first two movies. She was an intelligent klutz in the first films, which added dimension to her character. This one doesnt fit with Fraser very well.

0,"Lord of the Flies at Sea Debauchery at sea. I was hoping for maritime history surrounding a story of voyage and discovery. Instead I was held hostage by a group of characters nearly devoid of anything resembling morals. There was nothing nautical about it save the setting. There is none of the spectacular sailing footage that one would expect from BBC and certainly could have played a part in this story. The setting is a nearly vacant ship with an unruly crew and lustful, drunken passengers. There is nothing gratifying about this series. Shame on me for not paying more attention to the author. Once I realized it was William Golding I expected nothing more than Lord of the Flies, and these expectations were met."

0,"Dino Wolf in Dire need Dinowolf is actually a released in  film called Dire Wolf  which is more accurate in that there was such an animal but definitely not in the time of the dinosaurs  and not related to dinosaurs, but hey...My problem though is more with the fact that none of the reviews have any note of the things Fred is normally noted for and IMDB has no commentaries from anyone about it. Weird for this kind of film. I am going to take as wild guess that that is because most of the natural audience did not see this and the few who may have really had little to say. This implies no nudity female  and who would, with no offense, really wish to see Gil naked. It also implies special effects not good enough for comment, though possibly not bad enough for same either. Overall I have to go with my impression that I have no reason to buywatch this film. So I wont. Those who do, enjoy!!"
0,What a morbid and poorly thought out product Just the concept makes me sick to my stomach. Is violence something something to joke about? Arent enough violence perpetrated by spouses and exspouses already?? Amazon should pull this off their shelves since this is a tasteless poor stab at humor. Pun intended
0,"Its a waste of money even for beginner Sure this book is only for beginner or outsider of Cosulting business. But then, for the price of this book, I would rather buy a much cheaper book but with more useful information and ideas  such as Consulting for Dummies. The book is full of motherhood statements and it is more liked written by a grand mom and she called herself consultant But come on, Consulting is a highly skillful business that require structural, systematic yet creative thinking. Overall, I think this book is a waste of money for experienced consultant. While for beginner, the reader will risk the wrong impression that its this easy to win a consulting work  highly unlikely in a complex and competative world."
0,"Good idea. Poor product. Make sure you are able to return this product. It seems to work for some people, and others it doesnt. I followed the instructions, and got a clear channel, but the static was incredible. I could barely hear my music. I returned it within days.Another con is that it uses a special kind of song to change the channel. This means you will not be able to use the shuffle feature for all your songs, because sometimes these special frequency changer songs will pop up into your music."

0,"Paint your TV and watch it dry insteadits more interesting Okay, repressed guy who missed out on dreams retires into boredom. Wife dies, so guy wants to find meaning of life. May have found it.Took me  seconds to summarize the whole plot. Took the movie two hours to do it.Nicely nuanced performance by Nicholson, which is the only reason to even consider this movie. Beyond that, though, this thing is dull, dull, dull.

0,Not Good for Fringe Reception I am in the area of fringe reception for my favorite FM station in Boston. I use a Bose radio but I could only get the station by using a rabbit ears antenna with maximum horizontal extension held at  degrees to the signal. So I know there is signal in the room. But this antenna couldnt find it. It should based on the write up but it doesnt
0,mm cultural pearls bracelet As a previous customer of Silver Speck I purchased  sets of  mm cultural pearls and a Genuine Amethyst Peridot Citrine Crystal Chip Bracelet. I have been so pleased with my earlier orders I was not suprised that the chip bracelet was stunning and loved by my daughter on her birthday.It was then with much suprised to find the cultured pearls were mm not mm as advertised. I wrote to Silver Speck and received a reply from Brenda that the pearls were mm but if I was unhappy that I could return them and my account would be credited with in  days.I wrote back that the time involved and cost of mailing was not worth the cost and that they indeed were mm and sent a photo of the pearls next to a set of  mm pearls laid on a metric ruler.She replied the same as before.I see no reason why they should not pay for the shipping as it was their error? mistake.It is a sad way to end an business relationship.
0,JUNK!!! DO NOT BUY!!! The mounting screws which came with the set to mount the dartboard to the cabinet are too small. The depth of the holes for the darts to sit in are drilled at uneven lengths so the darts do not all sit at the same height and the backing to the cabinet fell off just as I am taking it out of the box. Total waste of money.
0,"So Disappointed I purchased the HARVARD DICTIONARY OF MUSIC KINDLE EDITION with some really high expectations. I suppose in book form, it would be great. I bought the Kindle format, and it was horrible. The search function searches for every occurence of a term in the entire dictionary which is of no use because I will at times have to click through pages and pages of occurences to find a definition.Amazon should build in some kind of process where it will go through a heirarchy going through words or terms as keywords first then occurrences. For example, if Im searching for the word tetrachord, Ill get  results. In those results, I still need to find which is the definition and which are occurences throughout the dictionary. NOT VERY HELPFUL.As a music grad student, I was really exited to have this resource available on my Kindle. In hindsight, it wasnt so great a purchase."

0,"Find another Fryer!! I have never writeen a review before, but felt I had to with such a terrible product. I purchased this fryer in March  and had used it about  times when it suddenly stopped working in June in the middle of frying french fries. I thought the outlet lost power, but after checking several different outlets, it still didnt work. My mistake was reading reviews on this piece of junk AFTER it broke, instead of doing my research beforehand. Had I read up on it, I wouldve seen that everyone is having the same problem and Rivals customer service is not helpful. The store would not return it, since it was  week past the  day return policy and I dont care to get another Rival anyway. I would much rather pay the price for a new one by another brand. If you want a deep fryer that lasts through making dinner, you wont want to purchase this one. But, if you enjoy your food being ruined and going through the hassle of unhelpful customer service, then this fryer is for you!"
0,"The clip design is horrible, doesnt hold rollers in place! My rollers came with cheap plastic clips that were designed to hold the rollers in place... only they dont hold the roller. These clips are absolute garbage and do not hold my thick, wavy hair at all. Im  years old and have been using rollers for FOREVER, I have never had a problem with another other type of roller set. I have yet to use any with these plastic clips, rather than the traditional metal U shaped pins and needless to say, I will stick with the traditional pin sets from now on.In addition to the clips not holding the hair well, they leave a weird ridge or dent in the curl. It looks ridiculous.Conair, get with it... stick with the traditional U pins, theres a reason theyve been used for years they work!"

Even though it didnt fit very snugly to the ceiling not flush, the metal base hangs about  an inch it was quiet and looks classy. Ive only had it installed  weeks now and the motor gives off this LOUD hum that comes from cheap electric motors. In the past, my fans have made most of their noise from swinging back and forth, and thats what I was worried about...but now I know that cheap motors can be very noisy even if they dont swing from being imbalanced. It really bothers me because its in my bedroom...if youre sensitive to noises while you sleep, you may want to spend a little more and get a higher quality fan.PROSAttractive colorsEasy to installDualsided blades for different finishesReversable motor for winter and summer operationCONSNoisy electric motorNot the best fit"

It is nearly impossible to read, it lacks crucial information and explanation of the topic. The exercises are endlessly longwinded, and are not helpful in understanding the material. The presentation, i.e., font and layout are objectionable and make it all the less desirable. This is an expensive book that offered no value whatsoever to my work at learning this material. Others in my program expressed similar views of the book. If possible Id give it no stars."
0,"This game is awful NBA k screws you over every chance you get. Whether it be ridiculous shooting fouls, your guy randomly running out of bounds, every single bounce going the computers way literally...whenever theres a loose ball not only does the computer get it, but the ball bounces towards the computers player, ridiculous shots made by the computer with three hands in their face and your chance of making a wide open shot is less than , including lay ups, or obvious blocking fouls being missed your guy gets shoved back across the half court line and no foul is called, this game is not worth k sports paying you to play it. The only way you can enjoy this game is to simulate through your seasons and not play a single game. All the talk of this game being realistic is farfetched at best, and you are in for unnecessary stress if you buy this waste of money and time."
0,"Follow the Leader is strange and disturbing... KoRn, is, if you ask me, a strange and freakish band that can only be enjoyed by people who are seriosly psychotic. The first twelve tracks have nothing on them, which makes no sense. Then they start of well with the catchy song Its On!, but Freak on a Leash is just weird, with the singer in the background making sounds like hes having a seizure. Got the Life is OK, but Dead Bodies Everyhwhere is just plain disturbing, with dark, eerie music playing in the background and what appears to be childrens music playing in the foreground. It sounds like music for Village of the Damned. Children of the KoRn is awful, and so is every song after this. Im glad I didnt buy this album, I just listened to one of my friends CDs. If you like bands like Metallica, Green Day and Lit, I dont think youll enjoy this."

0,"This Book is Worst than Illness I found this to be the worst text book I have ever had to read, the test questions it offers, are based on one sentence out of each chapter rather than concepts.It has no underlying themes rather than any one of an ethnic minorityMUST have poor health which is of itself racist and discriminating. I would completely disagree by saying that I know plenty of healthy people who are of minority statuses.The book is extremely boring to read and I agree with the first review, it just very repetetive and does not explain any concept in its own words."
0,"Cast of players with bios greatly needed For the Washington and Arkansas outsider, this was a very difficult book to read. In striving for accuracy and detail, the authors lost me with continual references to names. I managed to read approx  chapters but grew tired unfortunately, for I was greatly interested from creating my own list of characters and the parts they played. I will probably persevere and finally finish the book, however it was disappointing in this regard."

0,"Will not Save your life...doesnt work I have a newer Knighthawk and a very old plugin carbon monoxide detector. We had high winds and power went off last night. When the power came on my old unit sounded the alarm. I took it downstairs where furnace, water heater and Knighthawk were. Knighthawk was registering , ppm. Older unit sounded alarm when I plugged it in. I could smell gas from water heater, the pilot had blown out. Shutdown gas and aired out house, old unit quit sounding the alarm once the house was aired out.This is scary, if the power had not come on the Knighthawk with it battery backup would never have sounded the alert and I might have died. There should be a way to test these alarms accuracy, pushing a test button does nothing. Does anyone know of Carbon Monoxide alarm that is not made in CHINA?"
0,"Waste of Time and Gallons of Ink!! I now have tried for the SECOND time to try to make this product work with their DesignPro program. Is is far from intuitive and it literally took me hours to finally prepare my cards for printing. Then the fun REALLY began! They give you a template to use to line up your printing, except they DONT tell you that the alignment will change when you finally put in the product and hit Print. The first go round I wasted many sheets and gallons of expensive Canon ink to finally get some usable cards. I STILL had to recut them them with my chopper cutter to clip away white edges. Now, after this second try, I feel better because I have dumped all of the wasted sheets and remaining product in to my recycle bin. Never again!! Ill either find a product that actually works, or Ill have my cards done by someone else. It would be much less expensive than wasting my time and ink with this product."

It was NOT delivered in the original packing box as pictured above. Yes, it was bubble wrapped for shipment, butit did NOT make it work any better.. This was probably a refill cartridge because there was NO pull tab to activate it refill was NOT stated when I purchased it.. And, when I finely installed it in my printer  it did NOT print. So, I took it out   shook it to mix the contents and reinstalled it. Still did NOT print. I noted when I shook it, that the contents did NOT move or make a sound. It felt like Iwas shaking an empty cartridge.I would NOT recommend this seller S.W.I.T.."

For those who bought the CD in sincerity William Hungs mother, I pray that perhaps the CD player malfunctions .... That said, I must say the Bonus DVD is terrific. It is well produced and lets the viewer get a taste of the man behind the popstar. He is even more endearing than his track Inspiration lets on.

0,"I sure got some issues with this CD Many of you may not listen to this rant and rave because I wasnt that big a Korn fan to begin with, even though I thought that their first CD was a good enough listen on its own terms.  albums slowly decreasing in quality later, we have this putrid piece of sludge with the same annoying Ihatetheworld moaning and absolutely no rough edge that was present in the first two albums. These guys are starting to become squeaky clean, hoping to convince the world that theyre real musicians. WRONG! They just dont have the talent to write real songs that are as good as the guilty pleasures of Korn and Life Is Peachy. The worst culprits are the aptly titled Trash, Lets Get This Party Started and Dead. I suppose the creepy Hey, Daddy is worth listening to, which means get the mp, dont bother with the rest of this dreck."

I use it to pick up crumbs in the kitchen and to clean the car seat of a few dog hairs from my ShibaInu, no heavy duty job!,  forget it, crumbs remain on the kitchen floor and the dog hairs get stuck in the brush area, the inside where the filter is remains clean. I had this vacuum hanging on the wall and plugged in. It starts out with fair suction but immediately the power starts to fade until it completely stops. I dont know how they have the nerve to label this vacuum CyclonicAction Cordless. I will never buy another Black  Decker product again.

0,"Two books for the price of one? Nope, just one book. Last week I downloaded the free version of Alices Adventures in Wonderland. All the poetry was missing from it. I didnt realize it right away until I got to the chapter with the Mock Turtle. So, I came across this version and it was very appealing because I thought I was getting both books for just  cents. At first I was mostly satisfied since I saw the poetry, but the formatting of the book was weird. There would be a line of text and then the next line would only have a couple words. Also, this download only has Alice in Wonderland. This review is supposed to be for Alice in Wonderland  Through the LookingGlasss, but after you download the book the cover says Alices Adventures in Wonderland. Somebody made a huge mistake somewhere and now I have to go buy Through the LookingGlass."

0,"very mixed This recording is typical of the thrown together casts which got classical record companies into trouble. The vagaries of style and diction between the Padre Guardiano and Leonora in their dialogue  for example  makes you wonder if they are indeed supposed to be singing the same language. Carreras copes heroically with his dimishing resources and Bruson handles his undersized voice very capably. Sinopolis conducting, hasty, ill tempered and poorly organized, is particularly sad when compared to Serafin, Marinuzzi or Schippers on other more or less complete recordings. Overall, Levines RCA cast pulls together for the best Forza in stereo."

Lost in her anger is something that should be painfully obvious to readers  future waves of immigrants in the same boat that her own family was in several decades ago would likely be denied entry into the United States if we were to enact the xenophobic and wholly unAmerican measures she proposes.It is really sad that Malkin is allowing herself to be exploited by the right, and that she gives the right cachet. One can just hear closet white supremacists like Rush Limbaugh gloating now, ...she is Asian and even she thinks that we should shut the gates..."
0,"Not a very good Book to learn to draw in Anime format First off, I have taken a look at the book in a store. My first impression is that it was bad. One, the artwork looks very amateur like, more like a bad attempt. Many of the book he has produced are ones on how to draw american cartoons. Not to insult the guy, but it doesnt look anime like. I would not dare recommend this book to any one who want to learn how to draw in the manga style. I would sugguest buying the How to Draw Manga Compiling Characters or the other How to Draw Manga. I suggest those because those are PROFESSION MANGA ARTIST. Please dont waste your time and money on Harts books."

0,"Not deep enough or broad enough I recieved this book as part of a start up kit on batik. The billing on the book was that it was a good howto on the batik process. I found it to be remarkably lacking. There was no advice as to how to deal with the more common problems mentioned in the process, and the process, itself was extremely lacking. There were a lot of pretty pictures of batik work from a modern standpoint  but they did not fit in well with the subject matter and seemed more like a look what I did. There were very few pictures, for example, of the various steps of the process while the artist was in action.I suppose at this low cost, you get what you pay for."
0,"What? I first heard of this book on the VH Legends Syd Barrett and Pink Floyd Edition. I expect a book which discusses the daily life of a drug addict. I was very dissappointed.Aside from a few circumstances the book was little to do with drug addition. Instead, the book spends most of its time discussing homosexual experiences of a drug addict. The book is largely incoherent. However, it has been suggested that this book is best read like poetry. Even if this were the case, I fail to see any logic behind the book. I guess you would have to be ... well on drugs to understand this book.You can live your life knowing you missed nothing by not reading this book."

Seriously, this thing could not possibly be flimsier and be made of metal. The saw is so flimsy it bends in ones hand.

Obviously written to meet obligations to a publisher. The only solace will be for aspiring writers, to see that even a pro can make a mess of things."

0,"Very disappointed in this product I have always bought the cheap couple bucks tweezers, but the little stubble regrowth in my eyebrows drives me nuts. I wanted a tweezer that would grab those little hairs. After reading the reviews, it seemed as though these tweezers would do just that. However, that was not my experience. They dont do any better job than the  tweezers from Walmart. I believe there is a more needle pointed version of this tweezer, but I wont be investing any more money in them. Overall very disappointed."
0,"One sided Westren View Bernard Lewis does a hard job of interpreting the decline of Muslim civilization through the lens of historyBut he has failed at many places like prejudice and narrow minded western historian.He is correct when he blames the Muslims for the present mess, and fails totally to see how the westerners in th and th centuries pushed them in present plight and more clearly how the then British pushed them after first world war and how the Americans exploited, the situation to fight the proxy war with communism fanning the internal disputes and propping the poppet regimes suppressive to the local people and crushing the peoples movement in Muslim land.The vision of Mr. Lewis is the vision of people who wears all the time green glasses and sees green forgetting the colors. The book is good one sided western view."
0,Small Panasonic camera bag The quality of the bag was good but the size was too small for our use with a DMCFZ. We wanted a smaller bag but couldnt exclude the battery charger. This bag will only allow an extra battery and lens cover. If they would have provided a charger slot and a top strap the  star would become a  star. As it was it became a return item.
0,"lasted about a month I bought it  months ago, but didnt install it until about a month ago. I listen to audiobooks, which means leaving the unit on pause for hours at a time sometimes maybe not a great idea, electricitywise, but its never caused a problem for a CD player before. The unit simply turned off and doesnt turn back on now, and theres a CD trapped inside. I called customer service, who told me that a transformer might have blown and that its out of warranty which was fine with me, it would not be worth the hassle and cost of shipping it just to get another one of these lemons. They had no ideas as to how to get the CD out, other than call a repairman no thanks, Ive got a hammer. They did say if I send them the unit plus , theyll send me a new one. Not likely!"
0,"Love story disguised with redemption This was nothing more than a poor rendition of a love story that focuses on sex but has God speaking to the main characters. Can you imagine Hosea as super man? This is so formulaic that it was difficult to read you knew early on the outcome. No surprises everyone lives happily ever after. Psychologically, there are some flaws in this but she did get it right on some level and that is Angel needed to be set free. I only read it because of a friend who wanted us to read it for book club, but all of us are laughing and worrying how to tell her how bad it was. Please, there is better literature out there that has God interspersed in it. If you want redemption, then read the Christian Bible and you will understand how to be redeemed!"
0,"Space Odyssey Space OdysseyI liked the movie, I am sure at the time it was ahead of its time, I like the cavemen sequences, but I really Like the parts with Dialogue! Hal should have been killed with a virus or something. but no sadly no. I think this movie is more appreciated from someone who might have been at the time under some influence,there is no debating this movie added importance to Cinema history and that the Soundtrack is superb.And if you compare this movie to any movie coming out now as far as originality goes  Would win. The fact that the movie is so slow moving and long perhaps deters alot of people,thats not to say its a bad film.BY NO MEANS."
0,"Broke after about a week! All my son asked for from Santa for Christmas was a new Frogger game. He played with his fathers original Frogger handheld game and it stopped working almost a year ago. He was so excited Christmas morning. We were not super impressed with the mirror and not very bright display, but we realized that as long as the top had a bright enough light shining through, it worked okay. After about a week or so, the joystick stopped working. The frog only moved to the right. It would turn on and light up, but the frog would just jump into the right corner of the screen. Very disappointing!"

0,"It was Just Too Simplistic Based on reviews I read, I eagerly obtained a copy of this book. When I got home and perused it, I was vastly disappointed it didnt measure up to all its hype. Why? It is too simplistic! When looking for information regarding numerals, all it carries is a small paragraph about numerals in dates. I was also looking for uses of the apostrophe. Again, it only contains very limited data. In continuing to look through this book, I have not found a single answer to my questions!A person who already has style basics under their hat should not spend their money on this book. Instead, they should gravitate towards a larger style manual, which gives much more detailed information. That is what I have done. Many of these are available."

0,Save your money... Save your money and watch for free the same material but in much greater detail on the Internet by doing a search for the movie Zeitgeist. It was on YouTube last time I looked Slight warning though  only the st Chapter deals with religion...the rest discusses  so at least watch it for the st ChapterI was disapointed in spending the amount of money for something that was done for free and better quality. I am at least grateful to Amazon because they had it for alot less than the films website did.I am mainly posting this review with a nod to another movie because I think this topic is important to discuss and Zeitgeist does a better and more detailed job.FYI  My account is my real name and does not infer anything

0,"Disappointment leads to first review, ever Im one of the ones who preordered this book and waited impatiently through the recurring delays for the release of this book. I had high hopes that Martin would not sucker his fans into having to buy yet another book after this one to get to the end of this story. This seems to be the trend with fantasy authors these days, and frankly, Im getting fed up with it. This book needed some heavy editing, and if it had been edited, maybe yet another book would not have been necessary. I was very taken with Martins writing style in the first three books, and I found it refreshingly different, but when its strung out, it can be excruciatingly boring. I will not preorder the next book, but will wait for good reviews before buying. Caveat emptor!"
0,"Great concept, lousy execution When my trusty Sony Dream Machine was doused with water, recently, it still functioned well as an alarm clock, but the snooze feature had apparently given up the ghost. I found this clock online and it reviewed fairly well. The features were what i thought I needed and the Smartset feature was very appealing as i would never have to reset the clock again.Unfortunately, right out of the box the time zone setting was incorrect for the stated default Eastern time zone and I had to set it up manually. No big deal i thought and the clock worked very well...Until this morning when it would refuse to display the time, sound the alarm or even play the radio. All of this after only owning it for  weeks. I thought the warranty would be helpful, but at a shipping cost of ., it apparently is another way for Emerson to make money.i have since taken that . cost and applied it to the purchase of an updated Sony Dream Machine!"

0,"The Tarot Workbook There is interesting information here for beginners. I was looking for the symbolism of pairs, the numbers and suits, for example. There are sections revealing info that is not usually in beginner books but it is all concise and simplified. I keep it as a reference for these things and re read it. Thoughtful overviews, beautiful layouts so you easily get a sense of the meanings of important things with Information easy to find. I downgrade this book because the meanings contained for the cards do not have meanings significant to my queries. I try to use them but usually turn to another source to get the gist of the reading."

0,"Disappointing My book group in San Francisco was excited about this book but upon reading it was pretty disappointed  and we rarely all agree. Myself, I thought the book was an inconsistent rant. In one paragraph the author muses about being a speechwriter for an admired politician but when he calls her a foreigner in Iran, she writes a contradictory multipage temper tantrum about how horrible he is. It is difficult to connect with an author whose own beliefs seemed so subject to mood change and immaturity."

0,"Disappointing After all the hype and expectations, this tome was an utter disappointment. The entries are leftovers from Michael Grays research for other Dylan books, namely Song And Dance Man which I also own but have never waded through, and he doesnt seem to have edited it or put forth any additional effort. Many of the passages have incorrect information or mere guesses. I was in a book store in Berkeley returning from a recent Dylan tour, and they were selling it for . They had stacks of them. This was really a disappointment since I paid full price when it was first released. Anybody who gushes over this book in a review here simply does not know hisher Dylan history."
0,"Doesnt keep coffee hot Id give it two stars, but for the price and the poor job the thermal carafe does keeping the coffee hot. I normally make about  cups in the morning. After  minutes the coffee is not even drinkably warm. Frothing feature works, but its more trouble than its worth. Capresso says its not aware of the thermal carafe problem, which I do not believe see epinions.com and will not exchange the machine for a different model. They said they would send me a new carafe, though I dont think that a new poorly designed carafe that doesnt live up to its manufacturers claim hot coffee for  hours will solve the problem. I use a Cuisinart thermal carafe machine now .. I set it to make  cups at AM, and it is piping hot, even if I dont drink it until  or  AM."

0,"Revolutionary Girl UtenaThe Movie  not like the series. Having been a fan of the entire series of Revolutionary Girl Utena I would advise any likeminded fan to avoid this movie. Granted the artwork is beautiful and a serious collector would likely be interested in owning it. However, many things have changed from the original series. The relationship between Utena and Anthy has turned dark and calculating and the other stories are too rushed and somber for this film. Plus you only get to witness a few duals with very little sword magic and the ending will leave you completely wondering why you wasted money on this and why the director wasted his chance to make a movie based on his truly wonderful series."

0,A COMPLETE RIPOFF Bought a dual rearseat dvd player for my specific make model vehicle. Bought the install card for  from the dvd company at the same time at checkout and thought that would be it. Called the installer I got through installcard and he said his rates are hr. and if he went over how much I had on the installcard than I would be responsible for the difference. Of course if he went under I wouldnt be refunded any though. Called installcard and they said take they couldnt help me. If you buy this ripoff card all you are doing is setting the minimum price for your install when no guarantee it wont go over. Do yourself a favor and run like crazy from this company.
0,"What is this? I really enjoy Delerium and have thoroughly enjoyed the solo project of Fuller Conjure One. This cd however sounds like bad pop music. I cant say that the cd is entirely a waste there are a few songs that are very good. Other than that at time I am wondering what happened to this band that I liked. A bunch of different artist singing about love replaces the mystical sounds that kept you engaged to this other world sound on previous records. Some of the songs are so bad that they remind me of bad disco. Its a horrific experience for anyone expecting another good cd from Delerium. There are still three good songs on here though. So if you want to waste your money for very few good songs buy this. I cant say enough bad things about the cd, even if you like Poem this is nothing like it. They could find beter artist on American Idol and have a kid mix in a basement and sound x better. It just leaves me thinking what happened???"
0,Nice But Fragile This maker has a nice quick brewing time and overall good coffee but there are other problems. The swing out basket snapped off on mine and now occasionally flings the hot ground out onto the floor while brewing. The spring also is broken due to a poor design. The coffee also stay hot for only an hour before it needs to be microwaved. Not for a person who makes coffee every day.
0,"Worth maybe  or , at most. I wish I would have paid better attention to the reviews, hopefully you will. This book is at most useful in one or two spots. It has no explanations of grammar or usage, and mostly just lists words and phrases with little organization. There is no way to find a phrase on the spot, you just have to browse the whole book to find what you need. It also provides information that is useless. It actually has a list of words not to say to people. The author includes multiple ads throughout the book promoting his other books, which I seriously doubt are any good if this one is any indication. Its obvious to me that this book was made to advertise the authors other worthless writings. I paid ten dollars, but its not worth more than three or four at most. I wont even be taking it with me when I go.Sean"
0,"Unbelievably tedious I can see where this book could be a good classroom tool, because it teaches the reader a lot about words. But I found it unbelievably tedious and we finally stopped reading it. I was reading it to my son, who is only , but very bright. Neither of us could stand it.My older son, who is , seemed to like it better, but hes very pedantic, which seems to the kind of person this book is geared toward."
0,"Curvelle Not Worth It I actually purchased several months of this product because I saw it got rave reviews from WOMENS First one of my favorite magazines. The aftertaste is just gross I could taste this horribly bittercitrus flavor after ingesting the pill, even hours after taking it. After  months of using Curvelle, I decided to quit taking this stuff. I didnt lose any weight, I didnt notice my hunger decreasing, I felt jittery, and my stomach was upset after taking it. Plus, the cost for this stuff adds up and you could probably get a decent gym membership with the monthly bill. Again, every person has a different body and reactions, but Curvelle simply didnt work for me, and I imagine it wont make some of the promises it advertised."

NOWHERE on the cover does it even state that this video is not for beginners, and after reading the reviews by others on this website, it obviously is only for the very advanced.

Now I am stuck with the purchase. Oh yea, the claim with detailed explanations is a JOKE. Just read the other reviews.

I got this game becase I like playing games on my PC and since I also love playing pool, it seemed to make sense. Beautiful graffics, especially for a  year old game and the game plays smoothly on my a year and a half old gaming rig. There are a lot of game types to pick and fun to play for someone who has little or no knowledge of the games but for a seasoned player, it might seem like torture when even a simple shot takes almost a minute to line up and still miss despite your best efforts to make sure the shot was correctly lined up. The same shot in real life would be in the pocket in about secs. In my opinion, this gameshould be for fun only cause it does not compare to playing the real game. Also, I do not see how this game could possibly improve someones real life pool game..."

0,"Well worth the money. As a beginner in learning Persian, this book has been a lot of help. I like the simplified approach, the flash cards, the repetetive exercises and the activities that emphasize the  words. This book also helped me learn the complex Persian alphabet which is so different from the English alphabet. Granted  words is a small vocabulary in any language  but it is  words I did not know before! If you are above a beginner in Persian, this probably is not the book for you."

I wish I hadnt even bothered to finish it and am happy I borrowed this from the library so I didnt waste my money on it.I will definitely be bypassing this authors books from now on.

0,"Not worth it Wanted a mic that I could clip onto my Qs and stumbled upon the Zalman. My main use for it is Skype, and to a lesser extend, online games. While the mic does clip onto my headphone wire securely, that is about all it does well. The mic itself does not pic up sound very well, I felt like I was always having to yell into in. The sound quality is also pretty lacklusterfuzzy speech and lots of background noise. To top things off, after a about  months of light use the mic randomly became ultra sensitive and as was reverberating sound like a mofo, even with sensitivity set to the lowest. In light of this I threw it away. Some people say you get what you pay for however before this mic I used a  desktop mic that lasted  years, while the Zalman only lasted through  months of use. Buyer beware."
0,"not worth your money I bought this because I didnt want to spend an arm and a leg on a toy, and Ive always had success with bullets in the past. But its very poorly constructed, and it broke after two months of using it sparingly. It seems like most inexpensive vibes on the market today arent made to last, so I ended up just caving and putting some more money a Lelo, which Ive had for a year and it still works great. I figured it was better to just invest in a toy that will last rather spending the same amount per year on toys that will break after a month or two. Better for the environment that way and reduces my own frustration."

0,"A terrible effort No problem at all with Jonny wanting to branch out into something new, but this entire album rates as awful. Jonnys voice is strong but the arrangements and the musicality are shockingly bad. Its like Picasso changed careers and became a tax consultant. What sycophants at AM Records are telling Jonny that this passes for good music? A waste of .or any amount."

0,"Not recommended for quilting, tension issues Got this machine as a gift. My first project went really well, a couple of denim bags. My second project, a quilt, went well through initial piecing. But when I started to combine the pieces, the machine had issues feeding through the layered seems. I would have to pull the pieces. So I got the even feed foot, which helped some. I did get it all pieced together, then I started to try and quilt. Its been a real struggle. I cant keep a constant tension. I would test it on a sample, start quilting, and then have to pull out an entire line due to bad tension. Test, quilt, success, quilt, fail, rip out, and repeat.I would recommend this for two layer, maybe three at most and not for very thick fabrics. I absolutely would not suggest for quilting. Im in the market looking for an upgrade as I really enjoyed piecing together this quilt and I refuse to let the tension problem on this machine to cloud my enthusiasm for sewing.hope this helps someone."

We have  bottles and always clean them as the instructions state and are very meticulous washers. We also dry them thoroughly as instructed as well. I was so disgusted and I hope our little girl hasnt suffered any problems due to the mold. I am writing to the manufacturer tonight."

0,"What a disappointment I bought this tv in January of  for , for the tv, the stand and a five year warranty. In December of  the screen went dark. It would not start with the remote. If I disconnect every electrical outlet for several days, it will start up again, but will only last for a couple of days, as long as I dont turn it off. What a huge, huge disappointment from Sony. I was going to buy the  sony XBR LCD but I am quite afraid that I will experience the same disapointment with longer term use. I am now thinking I will never buy a Sony again, especially after reading about other peoples problems with Sony TVs. I think I will buy the Samsung  LCD vs. the Sony. Even with the shutoff problem that requires firmware fix. Sony, Shame, Shame, Shame, on you."
0,"The commentary? Oh please In the middle of Les Nessmans classic turkey day reporting from the Pinewood Shopping Center, I decided to turn on the audio commentary. I was treated to Hugh Wilson and Loni Anderson. Personally I think Hugh Wilson was drunk. He told a long boring and completely incomprehensible story having nothing to do with what was one of the great episodes in sitcom history.And where was the editing? Apparently all the editors were brain dead from inserting Muzak onto the station turntables so I guess they missed what was going out over the secondary audio."
0,"A huge disappointment Spoiler free reviewLet me just say that I am a massive Scott Pilgrim fan. Ive read the series several times, and have lend out the series at the drop of a hat to anyone I think might like them which is everyone?.Sadly the th and final installment is frankly quite bad. It isnt very funny, is unrealistic in a boring way, and concludes only after layer after layer of pointless and yes, boring complexity.My biggest problem are the twists that retroactively ruin a lot of the greatest parts of the earlier books. Not only is the ending a boring rushjob, but I feel the author was almost trying to spoil the books that I did love.Ill keep the book on my shelf, in case a friend wants to read it, but in the future when I reread the series Ill simply stop after book ."

The other one stayed inflated, but the black patches on the side must have retained heat from the sun and became soft because it bulged and looked like it would pop at any moment. One of the oars broke with normal use. The one bright spot was the pump. It was small but worked fast. For the price this was very thin plastic and a total bust. Thank goodness the dealer took them back with no problems."
0,Zero Stars? This book suffers from an unbelievable storyline  How do a CPA and a washedup supermodel wind up at the FBI academy?  and the plot goes downhill from there. It also suffers from poor editing which leads to major contradictions in consecutive pages. This is the first Fern Michaels book I have read...and the last.
0,"Not What I Was Hoping For I have always enjoyed watching Julia Ormond maybe because my grandmothers parents were Ormonds, born in Sterling Castle, so when looking for films she was in I came across Beach Girls. The other reviews all made it sound so wonderful, so I purchased it. Much to my disappointment, the movie is more about the teenagers than Rob Lowes and Julia Ormonds charactersindeed, I would consider their story line to be secondary to that of Chelsea Hobbs character. But I will admit that when they are on screen I enjoyed their performances and story, and the photography is very good.Update July  If this review was not helpful to you, I would appreciate learning the reasons so I can improve my reviews. My goal is to provide help to potential buyers, not get into any arguments. So, if you only disagree with my opinion, could you please say so in the comments and not indicate that the review was not helpful. Thanks."
0,"big disappointment What is it with lame holiday books? I like the Stephanie Plum books a lot and eagerly awaited this one. What a disappointment! Evanovich must be taking lessons from John Grisham, whose lame Skipping Christmas was a big stinker last year.

0,"I am amazed I am amazed at the insipid depravity that passes for art these days. I rented these latterday underground films expecting to encounter Kenneth Angerish weirdness, yet I was greeted with poorly directed, uninteresting and rather pretentious pornography. Kern is the first person I have encountered that can actually put me to sleep with his films about rape and murder. I recommend this to anyone who would enjoy seeing Lydia Lunch disrobe every five seconds, anyone who wants to see..., anyone who is willing to sit through two hours of Film without encountering an original plot where applicable and anyone who is amused by shoddy acting and incompetent camera work. I gave it two stars because You killed Me first was moderately amusing."

I purchased this router because I felt that having the added range would be beneficial  WRONG!!!This router is wonderful to setup from the box and when it decides that its going to work, has great range. However, the router kept disconnecting from my wireless devices pretty regularly. I was no longer able to take my laptop throughout my house as I used to because it would disconnect. I contacted linksys and the only option they gave me was to change the channel, which I went through all of them to no avail. I have since gone back to using my old router which works wonderfully.This technology is still way too new and Linksys needs to work out the bugs in it before releasing it to the public."
0,"Sweet mother of God Ive not read Karl Mays other work, though I gather the main characters of this book  Kara ben Nemsi and Hadschi Halef Omar  appear in several other novels and are much beloved by people Ive never talked to. Nonetheless, this book is just bad in so many ways I couldnt know where to begin.I almost find myself recommending it, as it has passages of some of the worst prose I have ever seen rendered in the English language. It truly is a thing of wonder. I dont think you really want to try it, though, as this book is tremendously long and slow as well. Given the choice, I would choose to be mugged and beaten rather than read this book again. But, sure, give it a try."

0,"Small Wonders I am a liberal and proud of it. I do not hesitate to vocally oppose the occupation in Iraq and the stupid turns our foreign policy has recently taken. I generally agree with all the views expressed in Kingsolvers book. BUT, I still didnt like it. It is offensive when a skilled artist like Kingsolver uses her publishability as an opportunity to stand on a soap box. Just write and reflect on the things you know. There are many experts who dedicate their lives to other issues world politics, economics, the environment, etc. When we want to learn about those issues, those are the books to read. Kingsolver is a fantastic novelist and personal essayist, this does not make her a socialpoliticalenvironmental expert."

0,"Escape Into Boredom This book appears to be autobiographical, with a scifi twist. Unfortunately, the writing and the scifi angle are both childlike. The author is narcissistic, selfrighteous and judgmental. Hes also an unabashed homophobe at least hes honest about that, and probably a misogynist. The writing is monotonous and filled with cliches, not to mention countless grammatical errors. The reading is slow and painful. If there is one saving grace to this tome, its to remind us of the conservative nuts in our own back yards."

My brother has dogs, so there was no way his daughter was going to be able to play with this...the dogs would just snatch it right up. Im serious...do not buy this if you have dogs!!The ball only makes noise when you rigorously shake it, so its still not worth it even if you dont have dogs. You can buy a cheaper ball with better colors for your child to roll around. since rolling it makes no noiseOverall this ball was a big waste of time and money.I highly recommend spending your money on something else. You will most likely get a better result.I have a  year old and I should have just bought my niece a toy that I know is fun and what to expect from it. I just wanted to get her something different. It didnt work out in my favor!RETURNED!"

If the creators of this show are so afraid of allowing outside writers to mess with their canon, then they should not have greenlit this book series to begin with. Save your money and watch a rerun."

Half asleep, I had to read lines and sometimes paragraphs over and over again, and in many cases even when I managed to stay awake through this grueling novel, I still couldnt not quite understand what the author was trying to say. Im not saying this book is terrible, I just dont think this book was for me. You must understand I was required to read this book for my English class, and I dont usually agree with what I am forced to read."

0,"This book is horrible. I cannot believe the hype that surrounds these books or the associated franchise. These novels are written at a ... reading level  the vocabulary is poor, the sentence structure is completely dull and monotonous, and there is no literary flourish.While Edward does the occasional chivalrous, heroic act, his behavior seems overall overprotective, condescending, and stalkerish. Ask yourself this would you think it romantic if after your next first date you found the guy hiding in your bedroom to watch you sleep? Or would you call the police...? I certainly hope my future daughterson does not think Edwards behavior is endearing or acceptable.That being said, Twilight is a very quick read and the story itself is somewhat creative. Onethird through I completely altered my expectations which then made its inanity rather amusing. Read with a grain, or shaker, of salt."

If I am not unplugging it in order to reset it so that it will turn off or on, I am banging my head against the wall while attempting to get it to play factory DVDs and CDs.

0,"Sets a new standard for tedium If youve ever wondered what a Victorian set piece is, look no further. This one is so creaky its got cobwebs on its red velvet curtains. I knew Stoker was an embarrassment to British literature when I first tried reading Dracula.

This is a great game, its just a shame that EA has decided to include SecuROM with it, and in doing so, treats its customers as criminals and limits their ability to play the game.I mean, if I decide to swap three hardware components in my computer, each on will count as a different computer and I will not be able to install Spore anymore.WTF?!?If I pay for the damn thing, I can install it as many times as I want!When will people understand that DRM is just a stupid idea, born from retarded brains that only see dollar signs and cant think two seconds ahead?Beisdes, it seems that the game was available for download on a lot of places a few days before it was officially launched, so what people should do was to download the game for free, send  to Will Wright and a letter to EA letting them know how stupid they are and how many potential clients theyre losing because of it."

0,"Not Good for the TREO  I had a Covertec for my Samsung i PDA and was happy with it so I bought one for my Treo . Heres some problems I had. When you slide the phone in the holster it always causes the power button to become pressed.. The thin cross bar covers the application and menu buttons so I cant press them while the phone is in the case.. The microphone is covered by the case despite what the picture looks like on the sales literature.. Getting the case on and off the belt clip is not difficult but its not nearly as smooth as the case that I bought from Verizon made by Xentris.. I have tried to contact Covertec and their web site does not list a phone number. I have sent them emails and filled out the online customer request form, all of which have been ignored.I will never buy a Covertec product again and the sole reason for that is they will not respond to my customer service inquiries."

I am a big Robotech Fan, watched it as a kid on TV, I own the TV series but this game doesnt live up to it. Its incredibly boring. If you are looking for a shooter move onto to anything else. If you want a Robotech Game buy Battlecry. Or watch the shows and use your imagination! Youd probably have a better time."

Yeah  its a bummer that they didnt include Hearts of Darkness, but putting Redux and the original together was irresistable although I much prefer the original.I was ENRAGED that some idiot decided to put half of each movie on  disc, instead of the original on one and Redux on the other.All I can say is  WTF!!!If you prefer to sit back to enjoy films in their entirety, do yourself a favor and dont buy The Complete Dossier.Its such a shame too, the packaging was insanely cool."
0,"I really give it a zero There is heretical theology in this book. God Jehovah is three in one and one in three. The Father, Son and Holy Spirit. There are not  persons in the Godhead as this book claims. I had both his books on the Holy Spirit and trashed them in the garbage. By the reviews here praising it, I think a lot of people need some discernment and a course in theology. Maybe, though, they didnt even read the book. I did and have sworn off Mr. Hinns writings as worrisome, having to watch every sentence to see if I agree with what he says. I dont have the time."
0,"Nice Try None of the hard work on this film matters when the music is so lousy. The cheapo but colorful visuals are fine, the cast is too. Has so much time passed since good music was written that nobody can tell anymore when something is bad? The Nineties may have killed any ability to judge. Used to be Europe was the source of cruddy music  if you think ABBA is bad, for example, listen to what the Swedes were listening to BEFORE they came along! It will actually make you appreciate that band. There are scraps of decent melodies that start here and there in Repo, but they never gel into effective songs. No matter what you think of Sarah Brightman, she can actually sing too bad they waste her here along with all the rest.

I have a bit of a penchant for romance novels, but I was anticipating something at least a little deeper, and a lot less predictable. While Kyrian is a good character, and the author is very creative, I felt that the book went nowhere.If youre looking for a touch of sweet sentiment with some semikink, this might be your cup of tea. However, if you want some depth and more story outside of the romantic angle, read some Laurell K Hamilton. She does it better."
0,"be aware I bought this book for my  year old son. I found the majority of the book acceptable, entertaining and informative . However the book also had sections geared towards older teens I assume. I was surprised to find information regarding who should bring the condom on the date and other sexual issues. The book states that wether or not teens should be sexually active is not a topic of this book but if you are sexually active it is beyond rude to....and goes on to list a number of sexual situations.I was hoping to share this book with my son as I think he could benefit from it. However, Ill be putting it aside until I feel we have discussed some of the sexual issues addressed by the book and he is mature enough to handle it.Its too bad because I think hed be more likely to want the other information now while he is excited about starting junior high and wanting to be treated as an adult.I"
0,"A waste of time and money I made the mistake of paying perfectly good money for this perfectly bad book.I love to read, and am always reading something. I took this novel with me on a hiking trip. Books are extra weight, so I didnt bring along anything else to read. About onethird of the way through the book, I decided Id rather just not read anything, than to continue with this lunacy.I have been a fan of Stephen Coonts since Flight of the Intruder, and made the mistake of assuming that he was somewhat interested in continuing to write quality books. This book isnt. I like high tech. This book could have been researched by spending two weeks vacationing in Hong Kong. I like believeable characters. Coonts has lost touch with what real people are like. I like believeable plot. The only thing believeable about this story is that Hong Kong really can be found on a global map.Excuse me if Im much more careful before spending any more money on another Coonts novel."

0,"Too much Chocolate makes you sick The LG VX Chocolate is a sleek looking phone, however, that may be the only upside to this utterly unreliable device. Using a new technology of touch sensitivity, the phone is difficult to use and constantly dials numbers while it should be locked. It is a mystery each day how the phone will respond to the owners touch. Sometimes, the slightest brush will produce a cornucopia of responses, while other times the phone simply ignores everything. The speakerphone is barely audible, and one is better off putting a regular call on the highest volume. After a while, my send key started malfunctioning, so it was indefinite whether or not I could actually make a call. The phone is not even structurally sound as, after only four months, the phone literally started to break in half. The phones negative aspects are so overwhelming, if there are redeeming features to this dicey phone, they do not even matter."
0,"Not what they say! This DVD has the music of the Platters and advertises the Crickets and Lenny Welch. There is nothing by Lenny Welch on the DVD that I received and only two songs by the Crickets. Platters are OK for the few songs they have on the DVD but not great. I would not buy it again, it is over rated at two stars, but the music brings it up from one star. I consider it a waste of money."
0,"Interesting songs, bad sound Sure, its  years ago already, but I just found this in my stack of seldomlistened to CDs and checked it out again.... This is one of those albums where you, the listener have to struggle to make the songs transcend their recorded sound. Ridiculously awash in reverb, this album seems to have been produced and mixed with a very superficial understanding of the soundstyle of the classic music from where it draws inspiration. Perhaps Im being too harsh... On a positive note, Alex Oropezas guitar work is outstanding, and many of the songs leave a lingering impression, which I remix in my memory to make sound better."

0,"Professor is just as loony as the book I had the misfortune of having Mrs. Hammadou herself teach me FRN . Her exercises in the book are dull, and the problems that she assigns were merely busy work. The book itself thoroughly useless and instead of backing up the lesson plan, it would simply be a source of daily homework which was long and tedious.As you can imagine, since Professor Hammadou was teaching the class out of her own book, she was convinced that every single exercise was worth while and enriching.I have a pretty good background in French, some of the diction that she uses in her book is not regularly used by French speakers. Her sentence structure is often awkward and clunky. Her own expertise in French is questionable if you have heard her speak."

0,"BluRay Substellar Obviously this movie is one of the all time bests. However, the Blu Ray leaves a lot to be desired. The picture is very grainy, and very minor enhancements only really color over the original DVD. As much as I love this movie, I cannot advocate buying the Blu Ray if you already own the SD DVD."
0,"This is not an authorized biography! I have heard Vidal speaking about this book, and it is not authorized the author refused to show it to him before publication, and he considered trying to block its publication. Since it came out, he has refused to read it, but has made numerous comments about the authors shoddy research, citing several examples of inaccuracies. The author also continually lied to the press about Vidal, saying that Vidal had asked him to write this biography, which he did not do, etc."
0,"Bad Sony is not an oxymoron This is the only Sony product I have ever been disappointed in. I bought it both for the Sony brand name and the VCR feature. I wanted to use it mainly to play old tapes and time shift tv shows and buzz through the ads, and maybe watch the occasional rented dvd. The vcr playback is crummythrough a glass darkly and fuzzily. The picture quality in the one dvd I played was okay but not wonderful. Its not even tall enough to use as a footstool. I cant even throw it away the trash collectors wont accept electronics. Im really disappointed with Sony. Think Im going to buy another Sony anything real soon?"
0,"Avoid These guys never made a real impact and this CD justifies it. The music is laughable and the lyrics ridiculous. If you are into thrash look for Sepultura, The Haunted or the old Metallica albums."
0,"Weak and Disappointing Thought this would be like A Year In Provence or some of the other books by great cooks, travelers and livers of life. Instead, it is a meandering collection of reminisces of a Jewish family in New York City. There is almost nothing about food and cooking, and what there is doesnt satisfy at all. There is also a lot of mundane and even disgusting stuff about dress and illness and jewelry and gossip and such. If your life is like this, you might like it. But if you are looking for good writing about interesting people making the world a better place with fine food, look elsewhere.Not recommended."

0,"Streetwise  Atlanta  Bad Formula I LOVE Streetwise maps, but they are best for tight, walkable cities like London or Montreal. Their detailed formula is great for the pedestrian. The trouble with Atlanta is that its so spread out, all of the interesting neighborhoods that a tourist may visit are not necessarily close together. So what you get is a large map on one side thats not detailed enough to be useful and honestly still not large enough to encompass all Atlanta offers and a map of Downtown, which is woefully inadequate since Downtown is only part of the typical Atlanta experience. Its just not a useful map."
0,"Really lame and really violent First off, I wanted to see this when it was in theaters, but I never got around to it. I bought this movie from Hollywood Video a few weeks ago and I was very disappointed. this movie was .highly unbelievable and .incredibly violent.It took too long to get to the climax. I saw a different ending from the one in the theaters, but i heard about what happened in that one. All I want to say is that Im glad I didnt bc that is too violent, and I am sure I would have been offended to the utmost.Save your money. This tripe should have never made it."
0,"I Cancelled My Subscription to HBO In this day and age, grubbing for profits at the expense of the customer has become routine. However, customers have buying power and they should learn to use it to relay the idea that this type of business practice doesnt work. I will not be buying this Part  of Season Six DVD set. I own all five seasons, and buying the fifth season was difficult to rationalize, but I wanted a complete collection. I draw the line here. I cancelled my subscription to HBO and will not be purchasing this wickedly retarded halfseason set. The executive who made the decision to split this season up is an idiot."

PLEASE listen to their version and not this one... download if necessary! The song is beautiful, but not in the style in which it was rewritten for Ruben."

Hardly the inventive killings of the old school Fth days. Wheres The Gore? As a writer Ive been disappointed with the plotholes these socalled writers left in the last  movies. Theres NO plotline continuity whatsoever that the older movies had!They should have stuck with the Crystal Lake Mythologies instead of the ...plotlines of   and X. Kane Hodder as Jason is awesome, but since he wont be playing him in Freddy vs. Jason that will probably stink too. Jason X had some moments but overall, not that great."
0,"Dont waste your time and money. The reason I bought this book was the title Counter Sniper. As a former rifleman, counter sniper is the most difficult task. This book has zero info about counter sniper. However, the info about sniper operation in this book is very basic at least nothing new for me. That just total waste my time. Some other sniper experience history books would be better reading material if you are into this subject."
0,"AVOID THESE VITAMINS! If you have ever smelled that vitamin smell, these have a really strong odor. What is worse is they taste just like they smell. Neither one of my daughters ages    could taste any other flavor other than the vitamin flavor.

0,"Boring Finishing this book is an onerous task. The uninspired plot frequently bogs down in scientific minutia. The overuse of clichd adjectives also becomes tiresome quickly. On top of that, the characters are undeveloped and onedimensional. I was deeply unmoved by the whole thing and do not recommend this book to anyone. To quote Mark Twain, it is chloroform in print."
0,"I stored this book in the dustbin The concept of the book was facinating no more children and how would mankind react on that, so I bought the book without knowing what else P.D James writes. I like SF and occasionally genres like Maeve Binchy or Rosamunde Pilcher, so dont call me a SF addict. I even believe I am a genuine reader, since I never skip pages or read the final pages before I really get there. The world described is thourough but some things are to easily stepped over how can somebody in an dying civilisation go on holidays in Europe for several months when maintenance is restricted to roads only. And the few events in the books are rare and hard to find. I tried to finish this book two times,  years ago and just last week. Last week I threw it away, the book is really BORING, there is no way PD James makes me turn a page, I forced myself wondering when will it really get started. At rd I put it away  again. This time I put it in my dustbin."

0,Inferior sound The DVD side is Dolby . which is a highly compressed sound format to be used as a sound track for DVD video to fit it all on the disk. Put it in the computer and check the size of the files compared with the cd. How could it sound better? So much of the musical information is missing. If you are mainly using the DVD disk volume for audio then you can use DVD audio which uses more volume than any cd can take. Using volume as a guide Dolby . is inferior to DTS which is inferior to cd which is inferior to  PCM which is inferior to sacd which is inferior to DVD audio. So why is Sony pressing these inferior formats .... because they now realise it is a good idea to have video and surround mixes in their music disks. But they do not support DVD audio as it is in competition to their SACD format and so you are given an inferior sound format instead.
0,"Good stop motion includes Pterodactyl!! Surprised to see a stop motion Pterodactyl in this one. Great scenes of attacking dinosaurs killed violently by bloodletting gunfire. I found the story to be boring but the dinosaur scenes were green tinted, exciting and also greatly scored. Not sure who did the music but it was first rate!! Better than Unknown Island but I still prefer The Land Unknown or The Land That Time Forgot for a good, cheap dinoadventure. Gee Wally, that Eddie is such a creep..."
0,"Collagen Breakdown in a Bottle! So many people are enticed into thinking that essential oils are good for the skin. Well, in truth, they are not. Essential oils such as those contained in these products are toxic. Essential oils cause collagen breakdown in the skin, which leads to premature aging. They also are proven to cause cell death, phototoxicity, and dermatitis, just to name a few harmful side effects of essential oils. Before I was informed of such hazards of using essential oils, I tried this line. Sure, my skin felt and looked great, but what about the hidden dangers that were going on with my skin. This product range also has a complete disregard for sun protection, which in fact is the only way to prevent aging and to retain your youthful appearance. As I always say, If it works for you, then use it. However, I cherish the health of my skin and body too much to use essential oils."
0,"Beware size discrepancies!! We ordered this product in a size  and when we received it, it was marked size  but it was easily a normal size . We had to pay to ship it back and exchange it for a smaller size, when there should have been an advisory that the skates run extremely large. It cost  dollars to ship it back for the exchange in addition to the original cost of the skates plus shipping. Other than that the skates are true to the description and are very cute. Therefore the skates actually cost  instead of  including shipping."

0,"Fairly good when new, now dead  trash? Ive had and used the Scumbuster for about a year now, mostly for bathroom cleaning. When new, the unit charged up and ran well, though it was small and fairly slow. My battery life was only about  minutes before it was useless. Not really enough time to thoroughly clean the tile AND grout lines in my wall, completely tiled standard  tub.It did well around the pool tiles, though again, battery life would not last long enough to complete the job.As the unit got older, battery life kept falling off and today it no longer works at all. My unit does not have a replaceable battery, so now its trash?Nice idea, just not powerful or longlasting enough to do the real job it was made for. Perfect for toilet bowl cleaning, not up to the longer tasks of a complete tub surround or pool tile. I also expected it to last longer than a year before having to throw it out. I wont buy another one."

The sellers of this Motherboard was ok, but the product itself was a very big mistake. When the mother board came here, some friends saw it... and they told me This motherboard presents a lot of problems with the chipset and with USB ports. I just wanted it works, and didnt want to have more problems with my computer. I cantt return this item now, by the politics of importation in my country. Never worked well. I just bought a Gygabyte, waiting for it in one month at least.Dont buy it. Buy Asus or gigabyte if you have amd proccesors. They msi people must to know that this motherboard have problems, if all my friends know it, and they do not design nor produce it. The price reflects that fact. This motherboard is not cheaper just for the size, or perform. Is cheaper because it has a lot of problems.DOnt Buy it."
0,"Its wrong. In my opinion, a man should not write a novel featuring a female protagonist in the first person narrative neither should a woman write one as a man. In either situation, the author just doesnt get it  its worng and it just doesnt work.I found most of the narrative insulting, the characters motivations laughable, and the dialogue postadolesent juvenile.In the Johanna Brady series, Ms. Jance shows her talents. In the J.P. Beaumont series, she falls flat.Would not recommend this, or any other book in this series."
0,"Too Confusing, Too Fast Perhaps I just learn differently, but for me, this set does not work. For one thing, the c.d. has people shouting off Irish words in such quick succession that there is no time to repeat what they are saying.

I didnt even finish the first episode of Oliver Twist!!! I thought Little Dorit sounded really cute but I was VERY disappointed... When I started watching it I was so bored I never finished the whole series.. Maybe it was gonna get better but it wasnt worth keeping to find out!!! Wouldnt recommend these to anyone!!!!!
0,"A misfire from Marie This album doesnt work because Marie Osmond is essentially a pop singer who records countrypop, not a genunie country singer. But the production is twangy and Marie sings in an affected twang that isnt very convincing. This was her first and only album with Jerry Crutchfield, who worked with Tanya Tucker. Listening to this disc, it sounds like hes recording Marie with Tanyas leftovers. Skip this one."
0,"Cheap in cost and quality I bought  of these for counting reps when doing physical therapy exercises. Theyre great for that purposewhen they work. I was glad I bought so many at once since  of them stopped working within  weeks of use. One of them got hung up on the  in the units column column on the right. The other would not count up unless you pushed the button at a precise angle. I didnt return them since it would have cost almost as much for shipping and handling as the units were worth. Unfortunately, there isnt much choice out there unless you go to an electronic counter."

0,Not good for the price I bought this product about  months ago. It died. I dont know what happened. I just went to plug it in one day a couple weeks ago and it wouldnt even light up. I also feel that the other comments were a little misleading...it only has  stations that it can use and if you live near the city its not a great idea. I live in Charlotte and its a pain. Its easy to use but I wouldnt recommend it. I usually had to try all the stations every time I would travel an hour to three hours away.
0,"Product was not in condition stated When I bought this book second hand it said good condition.

0,"Lost potential Live My Life, Please Believe It, and What Side Are You On are the highlights of this album which seemed to lack solid production. All of Jerzey Mob and the Outlawz display flashes of brilliance and raw talent, but a couple songs seem to fade out and the last track was cut short. Outlaw Recordz should have held back on this release. If youre an Outlawz fan, youre gonna want to hear what they and the Jerzey Mob have to say, but there are other Outlaw Recordz albums better than this one. Hopefully the next Jerzey Mob album will be more polished."
0,"Substandard product from a technically challenged company. This substandard product has such weak wire connectors that they both broke the very first night my daughter used it and she is a tiny little  year old. After much frustration I realized that the company doesnt show the wire connectors to the sensor because THEY BREAK.According to the companys customer service department, if I wanted a replacement, I had to pay a  restocking fee and  shipping. HIGHWAY ROBBERY. I was hoping my replacement would work, but alas... the wires broke again. I even used tape to keep them in position but no luck. Its worse than one can expect. The mats are useless. I cant believe they still use telephone plugs which break in days. MALEM YOUR TECHNOLOGY SUCKS. The only thing it is good at is giving families less hope that their angel can get cured.I have never been this angry on a company or product. Nothing is right here.

0,"Time for a rant The reason I gave this item  star is because if you buy an ipod you have no choice but to buy a  case with it.For a product selling at this rate, it is ludicrous for it to not include a GOOD that works! case or pouch to protect the item from damage. Lets face it, ipods are great, but they are very fragile.When you click add to cart remember that it is going to be at least  more than the price says, unless you want a screen you cant see through due to scratches which of course the warranty doesnt cover. And Im talking from light use, e.g. in a sweatshirt pocket."
0,"Ludicrous Give me a break. If there was a book written about all of the injuries and even worse, deaths, caused by the medical profession there would be countless volumes. To pick out a few examples and portray them as the entire truth is totally unprofessional and demeaning to the medical profession. There is a reason why chiropractors pay the lowest rates for malpractice insurance of any of the allied health professions. If you are truly interested in the possibility of chiropractic as a means to becoming heathier read the book by R. Martin or Chiropractic First."

0,"EDITING, SORELY NEEDED Mary Mackert weaves an interesting tale of life as a young, polygamist bride. This book is enlightening, from the perspective of a girl who actually chooses to marry an older man and poof.I gave this book two stars because the lack of editing makes the book excruitiatingly painful to read! The grammatical errors and outandout typos are distracting and make it difficult to escape into the novel. This book wouldve been far more entertaining had it been PROOF READ before publishing. Because of the errors, and the large typeface, I felt like the book was overpriced and not worth the read."

0,"Beware of buying I purchased this backpack in December. It was nice at first, but then stitching started coming loose and the inside pocket has a big hole in it only lipstick went in that pocket Due to Amazons return policy  days they were not able to help me with the bag. The Amazon Support was wonderful. They did help me find a number so I could call Prada.Prada would not honor their quality of the backpack because I bought it at Amazon. If I bought it in a store, they would fix it for me. The first person I spoke to at Prada Corp. was rude and condescending. The second person I spoke to was much nicer, but once she found out I bought the backpack on Amazon, she was a little bit condescending.The moral of the story is, I wont buy Prada from Amazon again due to being stuck with a substandard product and no way to ensure Prada will fix it."

This one was unnecessary to add to a bad story. And cmon, how could you cry in this movie! If you want a real horrorscifi, check out Poltergeist."
0,"What is this complete and utter insanity?!?! What is this complete and utter insanity?!?! This Set  was supposed to include Woody Allens VERY best little film Broadway Danny Rose!!! Shadows and Fog and no Broadway Danny Rose?? Shadows and Fog is an excruciating waste of time. September? Another Woman? Alice? And no Broadway Danny Rose? The only picture worth bothering with in this Set  is Crimes and Misdemeanors which is not only one of Allens most brilliant movies, but just generally brilliant. What is the deal? What is the problem? Where is Broadway Danny Rose??"
0,"Not the best potty I really liked the way this potty looked, so I bought it for my daughter. I waited a week for it and was so excited when it finally got here and that was the end of my good thoughts. The height ring kept falling off everytime we moved the potty and so did the grippers. The grippers just stick on the bottom and the potty just sits on the height ring. The back compartment slid off if you tried to pick it up and the interior shelf was bent. Also, the top to the tank compartment was bent and didnt sit on the back of the potty well. The free liners seemed more like a hammock that would not do a good job of catching the potty. I quickly took it back apart and returned it."

0,"Yikes This book was donated to our preschool library. It was happily accepted because of the well known work of the author. A parent whose child borrowed it from the library returned it because of the violence it shows in the form of Deadly Dan, the contracted killer. This book is not suitable for young children, or really children of any age. It should not have been allowed to have been published with that story line."
0,"Horrid Horrid product cheaply made, a head that reminds one of something found on the sidewalk, soft steel points, not very sharp to begin with, blunt after just a few uses. After these came, in a frenetic search, I finally found my old box of pins Moore pins is the name, not Gem or Advantus now there is a name that should have warned me off. Compared to Moore Push Pins these things are an abject failure. Sorry I ordered them, not really worth returning  Ill donate them to the local Salvation Army store. And, now, it is off to order the right stuff  the Moores do come in s, just that Amazon  its partners only carry s. Try an artists supply store for the large boxes."

0,"This book is Crap!!!!!!!! before purchasing this book, I thought this was going to be a very good book because it was by Alias, I was totaly disappointed and wrong mostly because of errors and lack of explanations on some of the tutorials. This book freaking sucks!!!!! The author is not clear on some things and does not give very clear examples of what to do. lesson  pg.. It seems he assumes you know what to do even though this book states it is for the novice too.Oh well,Im going to think twice about ordering another alias publised book."
0,"Good Book! The thing that disappoints me is. The fact that this Shrek is the same as the movie. I found a few goofs in the book regarding one left out word. And, another word that should of been left out. The only thing I would say is. This book is a good version of the movie. I would recommend the other Shrek."

0,"If I had seen this in a theater, I would have walked out. I can only echo the other onestar reviews here, so Ill keep it short. This is the most boring movie I have ever seen. Had I gone to see this movie in the theater, I would have gotten up and walked out. Im glad I just rented the DVD. The script is dead, the plot pointless, and these fine actors look utterly bored. I was especially disappointed because I really liked the first film."
0,Narrow I read other reviews saying these shoes are narrow  so I ordered EEEWW. The shoes I received are not WW and not even W. I dislocated several bones attached to my cuboid many years ago. I need wide shoes. If I squeeze my foot just a little it hurts. It is important to some of us that the shoes we buy are labeled correctly. And another thing  a W should be wider than a W. My point is that a foot does not just grow long. It grows long and wide.Oh by the way  the shoes look well made.

0,"You get what you pay for I ordered this system because I wanted to put new speakers on my existing surround sound system. Reading the reviews on Amazon, I expected the subwoofer to be weak it is, but I expected the speakers to be good to excellent. They are fair. This is actually the first item in my multiyear history as an Amazon shopper that I am going to the trouble to return. The speaker system I ordered for my computer sounds better. If you just need a cheap system thats better than the speakers on your TV, this might be good for you. Otherwise, shop around and maybe spend just a little more."
0,"LOUD LOUD LOUD!!! I have used a much older Beehive style Oster blender and it was strong and quiet. This one is unacceptably LOUD for indoor use. It is as loud as an electric chainsaw. It would definitly wake up anyone sleeping in our household. The motor seems powerful and the blades sharp.Update.  Dec Found a better blender on Amazon, less than half the price, slightly less loud, but with  speeds instead of  you can have more control over the volume. Costco has them in all colors including chrome. With a plastic base similar to the beehive style. Oster BLSTMGW Cup Glass Jar Speed Blender, White."
0,"Good cast, but film miss the mark. This film had a lot of potential the plot was jump started and became a moving target never making its point. The good cast held this film together and nice scenes in Mexico were goodbut the film never seem completed to me. The script must of been chopped up from the original or something, in the end this film makes for a remake in the future with a top action director to get it going instead of wasting time with facial cream a nice touch but overkill in film and other useless scenes."
0,"cats were not interested in this Our two Siamese kittens, who were  months old when we got this toy box, were not very interested at all. Big disappointment. We added a few pieces of dry kibble inside the box and there was only mild interest for a few moments, then they walked away. We left the box out for a few days but they ignored it. We put it away for a month, tried again. Absolutely no interest. We added a few kitty treats to the inside of the box and put a couple cute toy mice sticking halfway out of two holes. No interest. We put the box away again. Now the cats are  months old, we tried one more time. The cats could care less. Will be giving this to a friend who has two rescue kittens, maybe theyll appreciate the toy box."

They were not polished or shiny. I contacted the seller  times and never received a response. I filed an Amazon AZ Claim and was refunded. I do not recommend this product or the seller.P.S. Unfortunately, you have to give an item at least one star. Too bad, because sometimes the items do not deserve any stars!"
0,"Menards is cheaper and better quality I bought a few pair of these here and noticed the wick is not really adhered properly to the frame. When I used them up I went to Menards and noticed first that Menards sells them for over  a pair cheaper. I bought a couple pair and when I got home, noticed that not only are the same wicks from Menards almost half price, but also better quality. The wicks were glued in properly and seem to last much longer than the ones I bought here on Amazon!"
0,"A bad copy...not a tribute When I first saw this CD the question that came to my mind was why a band with only one official album have a tribute CD already. Then when I listened to the CD the question switched to why did the band permit them to do this tribute.This CD isnt a tribute, its a copy. Every one of the songs on the Fallen CD is copied, including the bonus song Farther Away thats a bonus track on some import versions of Fallen. Plus they added a terrible dance remix of Bring Me To Life.I would be fine with that if the remakes were good, but they arent. The songs on the CD range from bad to REALLY bad. The lead singer tries really hard to match the vocals of Evanescences real lead singer but most of the time she fails. Some of the songs sound like a bad Las Vegas lounge band trying to cover an Evanescence song.They call it a tribute, I call it an insult. Do yourself a favor and just buy Fallen."
0,"What the hell? Quit foolin around, Ja. I didnt like this album much. The album starts off pretty good, but then goes another direction and goes back where it started and so forth. Track , Dial M For Murda, shows his raspy hardcore type rapping. Then it suddenly turns when Track ,Livin It Up, starts. The next song is not bad. Then it goes to the dumbest songs, Always On Time w Ashanti, and Down Ass Bh w Charlie Baltimore. Worldwide Gangsta is one of the best songs in the album, and is the next track. The song is a freestyling type song with Black Child, Cadillac Tah, Boo  Gotti. After that, the album goes all the way down to the lowest it can possibly go. The only songs I like in this album areDial M For Murda, Worldwide Gangsta, and So Much Pain w Pac.If I were you, I would buy Venni, Vetti, Vecci, Jas first album, instead of this one."

0,"Another slipup in the series Just when the series was beginning to come alive, The filmmakers took several steps backwards with this one. A troubled teenage girl with telekenesis accidentally raises Jason Voorhees up from his watery grave that he was put in at the end of Part  and this pretty much restarts the mayhem and terror at Camp Crystal Lake. I thoroughly agree with one other reviewer on here that the girl that Jasons after in this movie bares far too much resemblance to Carrie. Gore is plentiful, As is sex and nudity, But this movie generally lacks interest and appeal. Definitely amongst the worst of the heap."

An arrogant golf stroke leads her into the woods rather to find her ball, she discovers a brass jewel case. Knowing her father is on the lookout of a ring of jewel thieves, Nancy is soon underway upon another adventure. The revision of this book, considering it was written in the s, which is to most fans known to be the era in which the worst books were written, wasnt all that bad. Although the internal art work is just TERRIBLE as in most Nancys around this time, the writing is average. Although the original is ten times superior to the revision, Id still reccomend it..."

If they cant get this right, I wonder what other problems might lurk. It seems to function OK once this defect is corrected  up to about  watts. You will have to connect directly to the battery for more. I replaced the cigarette lighter plug with one from Radio Shack and it works fine."
0,"one track mind This is a wonderful original of the s classic, but who in their right mind puts  minutes of recording on a CD and makes ONLY ONE TRACK? If you miss any portion of the show, you have to start the whole thing from the beginning, theres no going back. Each of the pauses could have been made into a track break so that you can listen to the story at your own pace and not have to start over with the same drone if the kids, telephone, doorbell or any one of a million other distractions come about to prevent you listening to the whole thing, totally, in one sitting. Do not get this unless you have one full hour of completely dedicated time to listen, with NO distractions. Otherwise you will listen to Orson Welles and the orchestra about a million times before you can get the whole show."

I absolutely love the Bebop sessions, but I am completely disgusted with the fact that Bandai and Amazon discontinued the Complete Sessions Collection.

Still for backpacking I wanted something small so no problem.I made the mistake, however, of not trying it out before the trip. At the campsite, I filled the pot with water to boil for a dehydrated meal. Thankfully I filled it with water first before i put it on the stove. When I picked up the water filled pot by the handle it tipped over and the water spilled everywhere. Imagine if the water was boiling hot!!! I would have been in a desperate situation with second degree burns in the middle of nowhere!! I had to laddle the boiling water out of the pot with a cup because it was so unstable. The mess kits with clip on pot holders are the ONLY way to go. The fact that this is marketed for kids makes it even more dangerous!"
0,"Horrible Butter Chicken Sauce, decent BBQ sauce As many here reviewing this product, Im too a Butter Chicken nut. I order it every time I got to Indian Restaurants. I too make my own Butter Chicken at home from scratch, and even went to an Indian cooking class to learn the secretes of this recipe. And I too, sometimes just need a quick sauce. This was one of two available at my grocery store. This thing smells and tastes like BBQ sauce. A decent one. But it is nowhere close to a respectable Butter Chicken sauce."
0,"Its not butter, its margarine The ingredients list on the package says margarine, as in trans hydrogenated fat. So not like the ingredients listed on Amazon lists butterand not like the traditional stroopwafeln  health reasons aside, they taste so much better with butter! Im assuming this is true for all the stroopwafeln Stroopieshipped by this company  there seem to be several different sizes. To their credit though, they are going to look for real butter stroopwafeln to stock, and send me some for no charge. Ill let you know how it goes!"
0,Dissapointing I had high expectations for this book which would have been fulfilled if there werent blank pages scattered throughout the book in the sections I was most interested in. It looked like the printer hiccuped and just missed pages here and there throughout the text. I had just gone through another bad experience with a text book through amazon and didnt at all want to go through that again so I just ended up keeping the damn thing.
0,"Disappointing performance The reliability is awful. After only  months Im going to throw it away as it is incapable of reading most discs all the way through without bad hiccups. The remote sensor also seems terribly finicky about the remote angle.While it is region free and the playback quality is good, the short lifespan earns this player only  stars."
0,It could have been better Mechagodzilla would have been better if he was the villian and Godzilla was the hero. Rodan makes an appearance and so that is good. Rodan is too small in this one and it felt like it was the same as the previous movies. It is kind of boring and dull.
0,"Gave me bad dreams I vividly remember looking at this book in the school libraryback in and had several nights of bad dreams afterwards. It isnt necessarily scary for most people, but for a child who has not been exposed to sinister images it may be quite creepy. I was raised in a home without television, thus I had very little exposure to scary images as a young child. If the child or children you are considering this book for are uncomfortable with creepy stories, then I would recommend passing on this one for now. Many of Molly Bangs other books are wonderful."
0,"An unbelievable waste I can enjoy good horror, schlock horror and even horror so bad its good horror if only for the film merit but Attack of the virgin mummies has none of these. It is nothing but a skin flick and a bad skin flick at that.The idea is that millennia ago...oh heck it doesnt matter. These horrorskin flicks can be good if they try but this doesnt even try. Its a bad excuse to have the most Nordic looking Egyptians EVER standing around naked with virtually no setsposing as they call out to one another just so you can change shots to the next girl calling back. Shot on video tape instead of film it has a tacky, s feel in all the wrong ways for its look. It doesnt even work as a skin flick.I hoped it would get better but it didnt and I will confess I couldnt even make it to the conclusion. I saw no point and will never, EVER in my life wonder what happened at the end. The cast and directors clearly didnt care why should I?"

But, did not work with Canon IP printer.Even after I got it set up with Windows XP and HP C printer, it didnt consistently work. So, I disconnected it and bought an alternate product. The alternate product worked with Vista or XP, and with both HP C and Canon IP printers, and installed in  minutes with the instructions provided, and consistently works.I would not recommend buying the Linksys print server."

0,"This Trash Deserves NO STARS What a piece of junk. The Darkness claims that theyre going to save rock. Its big talk with little show its big ambition with little talent. If I could get past Justins singing voice, would I actually like the cd? No. I wonder if his vocal antics werent merely an attempt to divert criticism from the rest of the band.They claim that they model themselves after the classic rock acts of the s and s. I shouldnt point out that s rock was, generally speaking, far superior to the hair metal junk that came out in the s. s rock is classic rock. s rock is hair metal. Thats an important fact that they should get straight. If they really think that they can save such a diverse genre of music, then they are using arrogance as a wall behind which to hide their obvious lack of talent.Its laughable when ridiculous jokes market themselves as rock icons, rehashing things that have been done before and long since forgotten."

0,"Mac User beware Is Norton Antivirus reliable? I think that can be answered with a yes. Well, there are not so many Mac viruses around, so that statement is not validated in my own experience. What neither Amazon nor Symantec really tell you on first glance is that Antivirus . is NOT compatible with OSX .. So I ended up buying Systemworks for a steeper price then the Windows products no less and it did not work. Two lengthy conversations with Symantecs service center in India later I knew that I had to dish otu another  for the upgrade to Antivirus .  you can get reimbuirsed for your purchase but it seems to take a lifetime. The Utilities package was unable to repair one of my disks wken I needed it... who knows why. Otherwise it seems to function OK under ..

0,"and  tips dont fit. I ordered this set on ebay, but from the same company as here on Amazon see www.mykitchco.com. The syringe itself isnt that bad, usable. I needed an icing syringe to use for decorating tartlets and small cakes at home.

And those are the sizes I need to make flowers on the cake, and I cant use them. Ive contacted with the company today and asked to replace those  tips. Lets see what happens. I didnt want to return the whole product, because its usable. I woudlnt want to buy the same brand anymore, and cant really recommend this product, since it doesnt have quality of inspection, hence the problems with the tips! I didnt know at the time of purchase this set was made in China. If I had known, I wouldnt have ordered."

Sure, hes gorgeous and hes got a great body, but going up on that stage and simply flexing your muscles JUST DOES NOT cut it. Wheres the pathos? Wheres the sense of drama? She sings her recitatives like shes reading a grocery list. If I wanted a list of arias, I wouldnt have bought the opera. And you know what? Her high notes arnt THAT great."

0,"Package I ordered this radiator using data from cars VIN and operator manual, and the Amazon web site identified the correct model number. The item arrived on time, but upon removal of the old radiator, the new item did not match the old radiator. The fitting for the ECT temperature probe was missing at the bottom inside of the new radiator. I verified the correct item was ordered at the web site and had to return the item, which was done by Amazon at no charge. Thankfully, the local auto parts store had the correct item in stock to complete the repair on the same day. It appears the wrong product was packaged in the box by the vendor. The model number on the Amazon shipping box matched the model number from the local auto parts store box. Bottom line compare the old radiator with the new one before you start your repair job. It is difficult to see this ECT temperature probe fitting when installed, so look closely."

Unfortunately I was disappointed and only use this one as a backup. I do like the color!

0,"Poor quality sound The sound quality of this CD is so poor that I cant bear to listen to it. There is a lot of distortion. If I try to listen to the CD using headphones, then the channel separation becomes a problem I hear one guitar and the singers voice in one ear, and the other guitar too loud in the other ear. If I put the CD in my CD jukebox, then I cringe every time one of the songs on this disc is played, because it is recorded at a really high level, and that, combined with the distortion, hurts my ears."
0,"intelligent, but lacks intellectual discipline... Reading this book is like having to listen to your stoned parents bragging about how modern and cool they are for having a tevo, while you are busy hooking it up for them because they still cant figure out how to use it. Although de Zengotita brings up some interesting and important points, he has an incredibly convoluted and, frankly, smug writing style which unfortunately seems to be passing for intellectual rigor in the academy these days. A bigger problem is that he hasnt made the effort to organize these insights into any coherent theory or even anything coherent, period. The result is that we are left snippets of insight coupled with the vague notion that hes onto something really important, and frustrated with his refusal to exercise any intellectual or editorial discipline so that we can be more clear about what exactly that is."
0,"This book required more patience than I had Having seen a number of good recommendations for this novel, I looked forward to reading it, but alas I couldnt get into the story. I say this regretfully since I dont easily give up on books. It doesnt help that the narrative takes its time to get going, with this Brother talking to that Prior using a stilted, high language. Even the words themselves feel slow.Not necessarily a bad book, just not for me."

This seat is SO tiny!!! My daughter, although in the  for height and weight, at  months old she BARELY fit!! Another reason I picked this seat was that it was for ages  years, but unless your kid was born  years prematurely, I dont see how they could comfortably fit past  year or so. I understand the seat probably couldnt really be TOO much bigger, but to claim this is for up to a  year old is crazy. I would have loved this last summer when she was  months old!

0,"not worth the effort had high hopes for it, based on what i know of target but its more cream than white, diffcult to assemble very fragile, had to buy superglue to fix it when i broke it trying to assemble. i am not a stupid person, but i really fed up assembling this thing. turned out it would cost half the price of it in shippng to return it, so i superglued what broke, and try not to look at it too closely as it looks pretty cheap.try something else."
0,"Kind of a letdown. I was given to understand that this album was a bigband cover of all the songs in Paul McCartneys Ram, which has long been one of my favorites and Im not a huge McCartney fan at all. But its not really that. Its more of a lyricsfree version of the same album. You still have the Spectorish ethereal chorus in the background, and guitars, ukeleles, and other instruments that youd not ordinarily find in either an orchestra or a big band. I think Id have enjoyed this CD all the more if it had really been an orchestral or band transcription, instead of a neitherfishnorfowl as this is."
0,"Poor writing, formulaic, insults readers intelligence This was my first MH Clark book. I read a lot and enjoy most genres, including suspense. There are so many excellent writers today that I cant imagine reading another of hers. I imagine this as the kind of novel an artificialintelligence computer program could generate when fed a standard formula. Dialogue was stiff, wordy and unnatural even the teenagers speak careful, precise sentences. The story and characters were highly contrived, implausible and irritating. Theres no attempt at thoughtful pacing page after page spent on dull events while the most climatic events, including the ending, get a few sentences. Theres so much better out there, folks break out of the rut of buying the same hack author over and over and give a new writer, and yourself, a chance."
0,"Dont know what was in the package I received this product wrapped in a thick plastic bag and then a couple of mailing bags. When I unwrapped it, it had leaked all in the bag because the cap was broken and the was no seal on the bottle. Someone could have poured anything in there and I wouldnt have known what it was. The product might have been good but the sender really screwed up. Dont buy anything from these people."
0,"Not my cup of tea This is a well written book, a pageturner I like the details of Elaines past and am interested in what viewpoints formed her as a person. However, I also think it is quite depressing. I read it a couple of times, years ago. When I saw a positive review on it I read it again, and each reading makes it more depressing. Her outlook is bleak, and I really dont see anything positive or uplifting about it."
0,"WHAT A DISASTER! I bought this CD in order of listening to something from Brazil. This is the worst thing Ive ever listened in my life. And the bad thing is one information I had from friends of mine in Brazil, Both Ana and Seu Jorge have avoided to say during shows that the song  isso ai its just a version I guess composed by a musician called Damien Rice, as if they were the composers, this is the worst thing one artist could do. They said that DURING A TV PROGRAM CALLED ALTAS HORAS, WHILE ANA WAS SINGING THIS SONG, APPEARED BELOW ON TV, THEIR NAMES, AS COMPOSERS. WHAT IS THAT, THE MOST OUTRAGEOUS THING TO DO, SIMPLY DONT BUY IT, ITS A DISASTER!IF YOU WANT REALLY GOOD MUSIC FROM BRAZIL DONT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THESE POOR MUSICIANS, BUY TOM JOBIM THE GREAT MASTER FROM BRAZIL."
0,"Spend the extra on the German version I bought this becasue it was cheaper than the German version Tap Tap Nagelspiel and regretted it once I got the package. While you get a lot more, the pieces and the hammers are plastic  I was expecting wood. One of the hammers broke the first day. My children still enjoy it, but the wooden version is much nicer and I do not expect this one to hold up as long. I ended up just throwing the hammers out and using the one from my previous Tap Tap set."
0,"Dont know beans about barbeque The author of this book obviously doesnt know much about barbeque, or much about beans either. It is amazing how he gives high marks to some places, like chain barbeques, that have very substandard fare, and doesnt even mention real barbeque places with good food right down the road from them. The reviews of barbeque joints in this book are not to be trusted by serious barbeque lovers."
0,"Who is this Horowitz, anyway? How do books like this get written, much less purchased? This book is hard to get through unless you buy into a vast conspiracy on the left to infiltrate the minds of college students. What is interesting to know  and that Horowitz neglects to include in his rag organizations pushing the Republican agenda are far more prevalent on our college campuses than Democratic organizations. The classroom simply doesnt promote that ideology and thats the missed point when addressing the hubris of this book. If it doesnt walk in lockstep with Horowitzs worldview, then it must be liberal. When he writes about the overwhelming bias of rightwing talk radio, television and rabid pundits like Coulter, Hannity and OReilly then hell have a legitimate gripe. Otherwise he is just stirring up a bitter pot of nothing much.Frankly, one star is too much for this propagandadriven drivel."
0,Too flimsy if you have wind... Had high hopes after reading the reviews but this pole only lasted about a month before it bent. We have strong gusts on occasion but I would have hoped to get at least a year out of this. Thats not the case. Spend more money and buy a more durable pole if you have ANY concerns that your home or yard is windy.
0,"From a flutist I do like it that Ms. Larson plays on a great deal of different flutes. I wish more people would do that. But the down thing is that on her Vocalise her playing so much of the time sounds like A Sax! How does she do that?! I would not want my flute students to get that kind of sound in their ear. I have them pick up Elaine Shaffer, Paula Robison, Alexa Still and Katherine Kemler. That is real flute playing! I dont mean to be insulting, but this is what I hear."

0,"De ja vu all over again If you read Princess you would be wasting your time reading this follow up book. Nothing has changed in Saudi Arabia or in Sultanas life and in the long run  after   who cares. What is most not believable about the narrative is that she, Sultana, contradicts herself repeatedly. It is almost impossible to believe that her husband, and her husband alone, would allow her to conduct herself in a manner that goes against everything the arab male stands for  a female with a mind and will of her own, even a wife, that he would allow this female to dictate to him even in his own home, no less. Sultana does not always get her own way but I cannot believe she never suffered physical and a great deal more mental and emotional abuse than she says in this book. Not convincing. Again  who cares."
0,"Print Quality Poor I am on my second R printer...and still the print quality is very, very poor!! It took at least  months with multiple, multiple phone calls and three sets of ink cartridges for Epson to finally diagnose a problem and send me another R printer... I have given the new printer many many chances to print out a decent picture but it just cant. My R sits just above my hp  and I print out the same picture on both printers using same settings....and of course my  hp wins every time....at least  more vivid pictures, and much closer to the actual colors on my calibrated monitor.The only thing going for this Epson is its wide format...but still I have had nothing but disppoinment and poor quality from this Epson."
0,"Childrens Bedtime Book The book is nice but very sleepinducing. It wholesome enough for children, so it would make good bedtime reading. While the overall flavor is similar to the Laura Ingalls Wilder series, Run with the Horseman is less successful than that series at eliciting an emotional response from the reader. I never developed an affection for any of the characters."
0,"What, no zero star rating? This just in, FunCom changes their corporate name to UnfunCom and their game to Arbitrary Online. I have played this game for little over a month and a half since its release and I have to say that this game is the worst game that Ive ever played in the history of bad games. Ive played through four updates, which have made the game less and less playable after a long amount of server downtime. There are many obvious bugs that make play tedious, and there is no major goal to obtain as everything in the game is completely relative. PvP is horrible, there are no trade skills as promised, and I am not the only one who feels this way. Check the FunCom message boards for more."
0,"This game is terrible  not recommended This is a terrible game. The previous reviews were glowing, so I thought I would try it out. However, as soon as I opened the package, I knew I was in trouble. The graphics are a nightmare looks like it was created  years ago and the commands are burdensome walk one space east, walk one space south, shoot, etc. If you like retro games maybe this might be fun for you but for me I prefer older games like BattleMech many times over before I would retry this game. After I bought the game I noticed that many of the glowing reviews were written by the same person, bumping up the recommendation. My recommendation stay away from this game but look at the BattleMech series."
0,"Not technical enough. Yes, there are some diagrams, but poorly presented relative to other books on lighting. So the Lighting part of the title is misleading. There is plenty of pontification on theory and what makes a good photo but not too much on the photos actual execution. Nothing on long exposure, stops, ratios, etc. So if you want a book on improving your creative eye or how do properly art direct the room, this book is for you. Dont get me wrong, the guy does great work. It would have been nice to see how."
0,"no English subtitlesclosed captions!  One star for this DVD because of the lack of subtitlesclosed captions. Its incomprehensible to me why a studio would do this, unless its a misguided and callous attempt to economize. There must be millions of movie fans who want subtitlescaptions for different reasons, so Im not sure how the studios think they are economizing by ignoring the wishes of a large segment of the market. I like to watch movies at low volume with the English subtitles turned on so I dont have to strain to catch all the dialog, while my wife is a nonnative English speaker who needs subtitles. Certainly there are many cinephiles with less than perfect hearing. So it would seem to be counterproductive for studios to release DVDs like this one."

0,"Wont fit blues I dont know what they used for a test truck, but it would not fit on mine. I followed the installation instructions and it just wasnt working out. I am a heavy DIYer and have replaced many exhaust systems in my time. Dynomax needs to retest this system on my truck. The left tailpipe that crosses over from the muffler kept hitting the OEM muffler heat shield. The right side wasnt much better.Also I could not locate the tailpipe hanger holes in the frame as Dynomax install instructions said they supposed to be. After fighting with it for a while trying to make it work one way or another. I removed it and put it back into the box and sent it back.I have installed a few Dynomax systems on various vehicles with no problems at all. This one just didnt cut it.I purchased a Flowmaster single exhaust pipe system and installation was a piece of cake.I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS DYNOMAX  FOR YOUR TRUCK.AMAZONS return policy on this item is excellent."

Both me and my wife bought Macbooks at the same time and have encountered NUMEROUS mechanical problems with both.Ive sent my computer in twice, for problems, the second time I got a completely new computer but still have to put up with problems. My wife has sent hers in twice as well.We are totally sick of the hours we have wasted with their customer support pretending that the issues we are experiencing are something theyve never heard of when their are websites dedicated to these Macbook problems.So after spending a lot of money on the laptops weve finally come to accept our keyboards occasionally not working, trouble waking from sleep, but just recently both our screens have started flickering... Ive just got to endure loosing my computer again to apple to fix... Once my warranty runs out I know Ive as good as lost this computer.I loved Mac but after all this all I can say is do yourself a favor and avoid this laptop."
0,"The handwriting on the wall says Palahniuk I first finished this book last summer, and clearly remember feeling robbed and violated. The protagonist is written as being tremendously apathetic, but carries absolutely no message. For unfeeling characters with something to say, see Salingers Catcher in the Rye, or Camuss The Stranger.Poorly written prose creates a text with literally no entertainment value, and hardly any redeeming qualities. Those of you reviewers who seem to think this novel speaks volumes about youth need to remember that very few of us are braindead richkids with no direction. For a writer with a talent, and a message to boot, I suggest you look up Chuck Palahniuk, and Fight Club."
0,"Poor quality, hard to install, collapsed when filled in. I thought this was going to be the answer to all my dog poop issues!! Once finally getting the hole large enough much larger hole needed than specified, placing the Doggy Dooley in, leveling and beginning to fill it in with the dirt, the X brace instantly popped up and the walls collapsed. I pulled it out, put the brace back in and repeated. Again, the X brace popped up. I continued to fill the dirt in and the walls started to collapsefold again. I filled in the rest of the hole to see if it would maintain some of the structural integrity, which once more weight from the dirt was put around it, it collapsed. Not entirely, but its now tilted and Im not sure how long it will hold up. I obviously, am not going to be able to dig it up and send it back for a refund, but Im extremely unhappy with the product. I think its a great concept, but the quality of the product isnt strong enough to withstand the weight of being buried."
0,"pages in and still looking for a plot I was really looking forward to reading this Harry Potter for adults but  pages in I realized I was still looking for a plot. The most magical thing that happened were potential story lines that would disappear or which took the reader on rides to nowhere special at all. I wanted to give this story more of a chance because of all the good reviews it has gotten, but I didnt care about a single one of the characters. This story reminded me of what it might be like to visit a retirement home to visit with seniors  except instead of hearing interesting stories of times past which revealed universal truths about the human experience, they just droned on and on about disjointed halfmemories. Obviously this book was a labor of love, but its also a labor to read. Honestly, this was such a painful experience that I could feel myself get a little older with every flip of the page."
0,"Wonderful quality but definite s vibe Ok, I was sucked in by the lure of a new soundtrack for spy capers. The Telarc studio story really should be read by any music appreciator. Look it up, its a shame they are no longer active. I dont have good sound equipment, but this CD did sound great on what I had. Heres the caveat. The CD release date is , and the music is very much a product of its time. Lots of electronic keyboards and I was really not expecting vocals. This is not what I consider spy music.The sound quality is truly amazing though."

0,"barely worth it if it was This is a horrible Playboy DVD. They seem to go hot and cold. Some I love, some I think were done badly. This is the latter.There are only a couple good vignettes on the whole thing for  tracks, and they feature far too much of this airhead shooting her mouth off about her posing as if she were doing some real major work. Less of her babbling, less of photographers babbling about her and this might have been better. But reality is, she is naked in it as stated by another reviewer, but there are only a couple tracks worthwhile unless you are totally obsessed with Pam I find her very attractive, but there are many very attractive girls with better videos under the Playboy logo."

0,"Photoshop CS QuickSteps For the price, this is an excellent book, but it is difficult to believe, given the market value, that any book written for a program like Photoshop would be written for the Windows platform only.

If you are familiar with both platforms, or can make the adjustment, buy the book  if you say huh when you hear right click buy a different book."

0,"one of my least favorite RDI books. This was just an OK book for me. Darcie and her  year old grandmother having detailed discussions about their sex lives was just too overthetop and unrealistic. As well, I was put off by Darcies continued relationship with Merrick. The storyline had great potential, with an exotic setting, which could have been better developed. Instead, the chapters seemed to focus on less interesting things. I recommend skipping this one, as it is not up to RDI standards."
0,"Not worth it The backgrond information was interesting, however it did not make up for the mistakes in the restaurant section, etc. I found the book confusing and inaccurate on a number of occaisions. The book also lists only a smattering of hotels and restaurants which was very frustrating. For example, the book states that Gabrielles Restaurant is on the edge of the French Quarter which could be further from the truth. The restaurant is far past Rampart St., which is the edge of the French Quarter. The bok also lists the St. Louis Cemetaries No.    in the Garden District. This also could be farther from the truth. Save your ... for a book on N.O. with accurate info."

Attracted by the true wirless nature of the reporter, I was willing to spend the extra money over competitve brands. Unfortunately the quality of the Reporter units is extremely poor as all four units failed after only a little ove one year of light use.

0,"Youll be dissapointed, too I know how tempting it is to ignore the bad reviews when there are so many good ones. You may also think that surely a product that costs this much and made by such a wellknown manufacturer cant be as they say, right? Well, believe it folks....this is definitely not worth the money. Im certainly glad I did not pay anywhere NEAR the price its selling for here. It is really loud on all but the lowest setting, and even then its very noticeable unlike the big, round, old hassockstyle honeywell HEPA air purifiers, which were really quiet on low speed. As others have stated also, the motor eventually starts to make a little noise not horrible, but definitely erodes ones confidence in the product. The oscillation feature can get noisy as well, and mine even stopped working for awhile. Doesnt even filter that well. Trust me, avoid this one."
0,"TRASH I had hi hopes for this film and was really let down. The first half was actually rather good and stuck to the book and the first, and MUCH better movie, quite well with a bit added into it that turned out in the second half to be VERY irrelevant.The second half of this was the exact opposite of the first half. It was at best sophomoric. I honestly believe that a child could have written it with all the silly and unnecessary plot takes and so called twists and the outright silliness that it all turned into.It was a total waste of time as it takes a great story and turns it into a joke."

The movie from day one was plague with problems concerning the people behind the scenes, who wanted to make kids film and the director, who really did not know what he was doing. Keanu tried is best with a script that was being change almost every day and I think he did well. I will admit that this is not his best performance and I would also agree with the majority of the reviews written that Rachel Weisz gave the best performance in the entire movie she is that good. If you want to put fault somewhere, put it on the producers and the director, they were the ones who messed up the movie for their own gain. Keanu did his best with what he had and he really did not have much help from the people in charge."

I won out using the argument that we just need to get the pain over with so the DVD can be shelved...forever.We are now rewatching the series for the upteenth time in an attempt to purify our memories of B.

However, she forgot the promise and marry someone else, the demon tried to steal the bride but got slay...Will the Luner Race able to ask Mahiru to retrive the stone theyve lost?

Its impossible to set the time on this thing since the button that you are supposed to hold onto it doesnt work  of the time. When you have it pressed it just literally doesnt move the clock hands and as you take the batteries out and reinsert them it magically starts moving again and when you push the clock set button again same thing happens and it doesnt DO ANYTHING!

I suspect this because this DVD is animorphic, so I am just praying to God they dont take advantage of the ability to program a section of an animorphic DVD to prevent skipping AGAIN.

It looks good and it has a nice feature set but beyond its aesthetics and functionality this thing is very cheap!The main issues I experienced were as follows It leaked. And I dont mean a little dribble here and there it created puddles. See the other reviews. Within less than a year it started to randomly stop during the brew process, almost as if it thought it was done. The unit almost became completely useless. The coffee maker tainted the coffee with the great taste of plastic. As a person that really likes a good cup of coffee, this might have been the worst offense. Of course a coffeemaker should at least work. The amount of steam that escaped seemed unusual. The finished brew was always short by about a cup or two.

A mouse is hardly what you would call the product of advanced engineering, yet Apple managed to produce something so useless, it resides on my desk with a scrollwheel, that was never meant to give you good grip, and thats now jammed. I wont even go into the details of randomly swapping clicks. Yes, i know Macs have no need for a rightclick button. Should it not work properly then for only that reason?"

0,"Awful! Dont Buy It Ive always liked Norton prior to NIS . Now Ill never ever buy a Symantic product again. Ive had nothing but problems with my computer since installing this buggy software and Symantec does not support the software unless youre willing to pay for them to debug their code. It was a complete waste of my money. I had to buy other software to replace this junk because the internet was incredibly slow with it on, pages wouldnt display unless I refreshed several times, and I continuously had fatal email errors after installing it. I cant say enough bad things about this CPU hogging software.This does not even deserve  star."
0,"DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU HAVE WINDOWS XP!!!! I was so excited to purchase two of these for my parents, who are going to be first time grandparents soon. While the devices themselves seem to work OK in that they show the  sample pics, the software DOES NOT WORK WITH WINDOWS XP. I wish I had read the fine print of all the customer reviews, because this seems to be a common problem.While the Ave policy is to issue replacements only, I actually found a nice person in customer service Ray who agreed to give me a refundI told him that I had tried both, and had read about this being an issue with others, so I didnt want replacements because it wasnt likely theyd work either.Its unfortunate because this seems to be a good product. I see that not everyone has had this problem, so just be aware. Its embarassing for gifts you give not to work so just a word to the wise.Perhaps soon Coby can get the software fixed so that its compatible with Windows XP."
0,"Arrived broken Just realized I had reviewed an identical product ordered from another company. The tray table I ordered from Amazon arrived in  cartons. The inner carton had a big tear in it and the handwritten note Should never have shipped. When I opened it, sure enough there was a huge crack in it, making it totally unusable. I had to return it, but at least Amazon paid return shipping. The new tray from BryLane Home arrived in perfect condition and suits my needs. This product would likely have suited my needs as well, had it not been broken. I would not recommend this manufacturer  made in China."

I have written this to the publishers Folks  I have been reading books for a really long time, but I have never seen a sloppier book than the truth about ebay  there are more spelling and grammar errors in the first  pages of this book than in any book of any length I have ever read. The content is completely random, with topics coming out of nowhere, with very little or no context. Then, when I get to page , the entire rest of the book is a list of resources?!!? I could find those on the web in about  minutes.I have rarely felt so ripped off...please tell me how to return this book to you or the author for a refund."

Had to run to the hardware store and paid . plus  hour of time to resolve it. Next, there were absolutely multiple places where rust was beginning to grow. Rust dust was in all plastic covered sections. Box looked old and worn like possibly even rained on before. I read the negative reviews in advance of this purchase but never thought it was going to happen to me. In short, I cannot reccommend this product.

0,Really not modern English This version is really not all modern english or at least not conversational english. At times it is very stilted and sounds more like nineteenth century english.I had heard of Pilgrims Progress all my life but never bothered to read it until now. After a dozen or so pages I stopped because the story is already known...I see no use in bothering to read it. It was instructional when it was written because so few people had read the Bible but now its useless.
0,"Great movie, audio is terrible I love this movie. I used to own it on VHS and it was great.Something is wrong with the audio when Republic Pictures transferred it to DVD. Sometimes, the dialog is so soft it can barely be heard through the TV. If I turn the volume up to max on my TV, I can then hear the quiet scenes. Then the I get blasted when the next scene starts. It is a very difficult and frustrating version to watch.As a caveat, I only used my TV speakers to watch the video. It is possible that a good home theater system with surround will play fine."

Many individuals were squirming in their seets, and not from a rush of hormones. They, like myself, were uncomfortable!"

0,"Dull and outdated translation, ugly edition This book, beloved since childhood in Ukraine, has turned out to be a total disappointment. This English translation which I bought to read to my son is really dull and outdated. People dont speak this way in real life e.g. Oh, lordy, lordy! was my favorite phrase. And why in the world was Bok in the next, same low quality book Karlson flies again renamed Mrs. Crawley? The edition itself is very uninviting  scarce black and white drawings and thick grey supermarket book style pages. In a nutshell  a disappointment, but there are no other choices for this otherwise wonderful childrens book."
0,"Frustrating Interruption The critics are right. The case is cardboard, most shocking because it wont hold up over time. The critics are also right about the break in the film.The break is at a critical point in the film and the interruption is extremely frustrating.

Presentation ."
0,"One star is being generous. This movie is bad. Bad casting, bad acting, bad script, and bad direction. Even the special effects are bad! If you are a fan of movies like Sahara, National Treasure, and Prince of Persia then this movie is for you. Otherwise, stay far away from this uninspired, dull, soulless remake. Apart from the obvious flaws you notice immediately into the film, the most disappointing is that this movie takes away all the charm the original Clash of the Titans had. A perfect example is Bubo, the mechanical owl who helps Perseus in the first film. He served as a RD type character providing comic relief as well as being a guide for the hero. In this movie, Perseus notices Bubo on a pile of junk and picks him up and asks What is this?. In response, he is told to leave THAT behind. He is then tossed back onto the pile of junk with a shrug. Enough said."
0,"Im a conservative and didnt like it! I am a conservative, but found this book to be substandard in every way. Couldnt read it to the end  plus am angry with NewsMax for endorsing it and making me buy it, as they clearly must have an antiHilary agenda, so much so that it clouds their minds.I dont wish to see her as President either, but that doesnt make me sink so low as to slander and trash her in such a distasteful way, and neither should they.While reading the book I kept getting one feeling, and one feeling only That someone must have paid Klein an awful lot of money to write it. Otherwise, who would write such a book on their own volition?"

0,"The Worst Biography Ive ever Encountered Without footnotes or bibliography, the author claims to reveal to us the hidden Danny Kaye. Instead, he serves up a large dose of contempt and putdowns, and his own subtle and notsosubtle hostility for his subject. The more I read, the angrier I got, until I decided this book was not worth finishing. Its far more revealing of the authors mental and emotional state than of Danny Kaye. For me, the book is an insult, not just to Danny Kaye, but to the reader as well. Danny Kaye certainly deserves a careful indepth accurate, definitive biography. Instead, this book appears to be an intentional character assassination piece. I dont remember any other book that has been such a turnoff."
0,"Warning to ordinary readers! I am writing this review because I wish I had read one like it before I bought this book. The only reason to read this book is if your religious or other beliefs prevent you from reading a real thriller such as one written by Thomas Perry or James W. Hall one with welldrawn characters, realistic dialog, a plotline free of contradictions, professionally edited, tighly written and with no glaring grammatical mistakes. If you dont care about those things, and if you cant abide even a hint of sex, profanity or bloodshed, and if you like to read about people praying every five pages, then this book is for you. And dont be misled like I was by the high reader rating  its pretty obvious that most of them were planted."
0,"AntiMelodic Rambling Initially during the first few tracks you think this is going to be a cool, bluesy experience something you can listen to in the evening time with the windows open and just enjoy maybe something to play low behind casual conversation and cocktails. Then when you advance further into the disc, you realize that the song you are listening to is practically indistinguishable from the track before it. By the fourth track, if you still have the speakers turned up enough to hear the music, you will probably go from being relaxed to annoyed. The songs are three times longer than they should be, they are repetetive, and they go nowhere. There is no discernable melody, no hook, and even though the guitar is played with relative proficiency, the song composition leaves something to be desired. You will find yourself turning up the music to make sure your CD player isnt skipping. I threw my copy away."
0,"good for background but not for the test I have read the entire book and purchased the complete test bank on CD that Mike Myers offers.

0,"Good intentions with mediocre results. While the subject of Gifted Trust did not manage to appall me, its inept writing and sloppy editing did. With the possible exception of Jeffrey Michael Roberts, all the characters are as flat and unengaging as any to be found in a novel by Dan Brown or John Grisham. Add to that the misplaced puncuation marks the frequent use of youre where your was intended the incorrect spelling of Joni not Joannie Mitchells namea few of the numerous mistakes a competent editor would not have missed. The author is not entirely untalented there are moments when he exhibits the flair of a good storyteller. But overall, this book serves as an example of a great premise that has been clumsily executed, not unlike The Lovely Bones. In the hands of a more accomplished writer, such as Scott Smith, Gifted Trust could have been a very fine addition to the horror genre."
0,"Internal battery has very short life I bought several of these Belkin VA UPS and had the same experience with all of them. For the first    months, the battery provides a pretty good amount of backup time before it dies when the outside power fails. After    months, my battery has such little capacity left that it can run my one computer for less than  seconds before it dies. For a VA UPS, this number should be  minutes. Since I have three Belkin UPS units and they all degraded about the same rate, I am very disappointed. I wont buy any more UPS from Belkin. I also have an APC UPS, it degrades too over time too but its battery seems to last about    months."

She got a cut on her forehead and a black eye!!!! My little girl is very tiny about  pounds, if she can fall right through this thing Id hate to see what a bigger huskier toddler could do to it.

Instead, all I heard was manufactures crap mixed with, well, CRAP! I loved the  Cent album, . for that one and I loved the gunit album, ., but this album was terrible. All the songs sounded the same, most sounded like they were manufactured for publicity, On fire sounded like KRSONEs Step into a world and there was this other song that sounded like s Many men... it was retarded. I believe this album has no good songs, no quality, no catchy coruses, basically NOTHING. I was really dissapointed and I will return this CD for something better. Its not even worth buring. I hope the Young Buck CD is better. Lloyd Banks album sucks and it felt like there was no time or skill or anything put into it. He was good in GUnit but as a solo artist, HE SUCKS!!!"

0,Too Much Whining!!!! Because I enjoyed the first two books of this series so much I gave this one a chance as well. Philippa spends a great deal of this book complaining about how awful her life is being a rich hieress and being dumped by a man she hardly knew. The story only pickes up and becomes half interesting when Crispen enters her life. The small sttempt at suspense will be negated if you paid attention in history class. Not one of Ms. Smalls better efforts.

0,"Needs some sharpening There is a germ of a good book in here. It needs to be whittled down by  and the characters need more personality. It has some excitement in the trading scenes, but you have to slog through worthless stuff to get to them. For example, we go through a long, dull chapter describing a visit to the narrators mum, hear a description of his father, his fathers death, etc. and it really is all for naught. I hope his other books are better. Maybe if he read some Hammet or Hemmingway he can pick up some pointers on how to make the prose more efficient."
0,They dont make them like they used to My parents have one of these that is  years old and works fine so I bought one. Unfortunately the mechanism is sloppy and the grinding blades get jammed in the drive gears. It seems like the company would have mastered the design of this simple machine. i think there has been too much cost cutting.
0,Disappointed I am very disappointed with this product. The arms dont stay closed in position when using it round the neck. My main purpose was to get it so my old mother could use it hands free round her neck but she cant as the arms keep popping out. Its quite inconvenient. I tried to stick the arms but that doesnt help either. The locks to keep the arms in place are too flimsy thats why they dont stay in place. I would not recommed buying this unless you are going to use it propped on a table.

I am SOOOO glad that I got this audiobook for free from my library instead of having to purchase it. It was very hard for me to listen to the whole two cds, but I did, and I am sorry that I did. I finished listening to these cds feeling creepy, angry, negative, confused and resentful. If you want some reasons to hate yourself and mankind, this cd is for you. If you want lessons or guidance on manifesting, feeling good, love or compassion, seek elsewhere. If her other audiobooks are like this one, I would never recommend them to anyone for any purpose."

0,"Not Campy, Not Scary Just Stupid While there were a few decent Jaws ripoffs Joe Dantes Piranha for one, this is certainly not one of them. This film fails despite its Cast of American Film Royalty. Ive read accounts of how lateinlife John Huston needed the money, that Shelley Winters took any role she was offered, and that Bo Hopkins was dying to be a leading man. But Henry Fonda, for Gods sake, what was he thinking ? Probably the same thing that the Screenwriters were thinking  nothing. The premise of a giant octopus gone mad by an evil corporations greed is as old as dirt but the conclusion of Shamu enjoying squid for supper was, to say the least, unique.

0,"A childs parable parading as an adult novelette I read this while waiting for a hair cut appointment. Yes, it was simple and sweet, but not much more. I was expecting substance, but instead treated to a predictable outcome, albeit via an original voice.

The graphics are good which is a plus but they arent excellent. The zombie fighting in this game is horrible and stupid. I beat this game in  hours!

They said they were sending firmware to me and never did. Horrible service.
0,Hitch Critter Busted This product was sent to us twice and it never worked. When we looked at it we found that the inside of the hitch criter was broken into pieces. Amazon was nice enough to refund our money.
0,"nothing but problems I was able to use this cleaner once before it broke. After one use, the spinning brush unit had to be professionally replaced. After second use, the plastic around the clean water tank seal broke spilling water everywhere. Ive spent more money and wasted time on this thing than ever envisioned. Next time...Ill be hiring a professional to come do my whole house for portion of the price."
0,"Quality really fell off on this Model I regret not paying attention to the customer comments brfore placing my order. As many said they would, they did ...These cups cracked their seals, where now moisture builds in between the layers as well as the plastic cup vrs stainless does not hold their temperature HEAT nearly as long.GO STAINLESS, its worth the extra bucks"
0,This is a piece of junk! I bought this player .... The player died within less than a year. There is an annoying problem the media tray opens and immediately closes whenever you push the openclose button. I have to pull the tray quickly to be able to put my DVDCD in. Sounds ridiculous? This is the worst electronics i have ever bought.I will avoid any products from Apex in the future.
0,"NO NO NO!!!!! This movie is the pinnacle of trash. I have seen quite a few movies and this is the absolute worst. Now I do admit I like cheesy movies to get a laugh from but this is no cheese, this is straight up junk. Im surprised anyone would want to associate themselves with this movie. Actually this is so bad it qualifies as a bookend or a coaster NOT a movie. Hmm if I had the choice I would give it negative  stars."
0,"this band truly sucks!!!!! Linkin Park is soo hardcore I cant believe it. Bands like Slipknot, Cannibal Corpse, Metallica, Dimmu Borgir and Killswitch Engage are really wimpy compared to this stuff! The rapper and frontman in this band blow Corey Taylor away! The guitar players are so much more skilled than Kirk Hammet!This is basically mainstram crap that makes me look like a great guitar player and I just started  years ago! Ive probably been playing  years and  months longer than the guys in this band, and it really shows.This isnt rock, it has RAP lyrics which ruins it. This is not raphiphop, it has really pathetic guitar playing accompanying the rapper, this is not metal or numetal, its way too wimpy to be even NuMetal, and this isnt punk, its too poser.Listen to real rock blur real rap eminem real metal Metallica real NuMetal KoRn, or Death Metal Dimmu Borgir or real punk NOFX. this is totally pathetic, I cant even describe it.You posers know Im right..."
0,"HP Printer xi All in One  TERRIBLE MACHINE! I purchased this machine  years ago. I used it sparingly for home print jobs, about  pieces a paper a week give or take for about  months. Then I packed it away for about a year. I took her out a few months ago, and have nothing but Paper jams, loud painful noises and error messages. I went to the HP website and walked myself through some of the fixes  however after about a total  pieces of paper that have been successfully printed on, I have the CARRIAGE JAM error that everyone is complaining about. The printercopierscanner is completely USELESS! This machine costs over . and if I calculate it correctly only worked for a total of about  months straight. I would NEVER recommend another HP printer after the problems Ive dealt with. The repairs would cost more then if I just purchased myself a spiffy new Canon."
0,"May be a good product, but the shelf life stinks! I purchased the bottle of  tablets. Before I got very far in the bottle, they degraded, and I am now forced to throw them out. The coating on these tablets needs to be improved to equal the shelf life marked on the bottle. I have a lot of natural supplements in my cabinet, and none have responded this way. Beware!"
0,"Very biased  you can do MUCH better I buy a guide book to learn about the country I am visiting, preferably through a reasonably sympathetic eye. I dont want cheerleading or rosecolored glasses, but I dont expect open hostility or overt political bias. But the Lonely Planet Guide to Israel and the Palestinian Territories is full of just that. The author is overtly antiZionist in his tone, unnecessarily political, and to me outright offensive. I DO begrudge ones political views in a travel guide! If I want a political text and I read voraciously about Israel, from a variety of viewpoints, I will buy one.This is a terrible guide. You can do much better, and at the time of this writing, I would suggest the Frommers Israel Guide, just released in October . Anything would be better than this."
0,"No new ideas Maybe I am naive, but I think if a book promises total selfconfidence, it ought to deliver. This book does not deliver.I admit, any book making these kind of claims would have a tough time delivering on them, but the main reason I am disappointed is that the ideas espoused in this book are hardly original. Instead, his ideas range from cliche statements lifted straight from Dale Carnegie be a good listener, let the other guy know you are impressed with him to the purely metaphysical, such as whatever the human mind can conceive, it can acheive now, pardon me for just a second while I use my mind power to get out of this wheelchair.For somebody with absolutely no selfconfidence, these tips are good to start out with, but for most people they will simply be common sense. A reader should expect a lot more from someone who has a Ph.D. in the subject."
0,"What was Maxis thinking? It was a stupid decision for Maxis to make a game this complex right off the bat. The best part of Sims  was that even if you didnt have the best computer, the game would still run great. That is not the case with Sims , becuse you HAVE to have a new computer to enjoy this game. Unfortionately, Many people who play the sims dont really have the BEST computers in the world.Hopefully Maxis will fix this with a patch of some sort.If you dont have a brand new computer, expect long load times, and very choppy graphics depending on the size of the house. The best way to remedy the loading situation is to build a small house and how fun is that?."
0,"Easy read for elementary students, but beyond that age, not very enjoyable. From the moment I started reading this book until the end of the book, I could predict everything that was going to happen In other words, this book was too full of cliches for my liking. I personally love fantasy, and I hoped to read some fresh materials, but this book definitely did not bring anything new.Starting with Gabrielles mysterious birth to the generic plot line, I felt like I was just reading a poorlywritten and sappy romance novel. I honestly could not read more than  pages per day because of the sappiness in some parts.Overall, the story is extremely simple, very easy to follow and foreshadow, and cliche, so I would only suggest elementary school kids or ESL students to read this book."
0,"A bit much I bought this thinking it would be a sea story, which it was, but it was an Arnold Swarzenega ? teenagers fantasy, of unremitting action, busty slender beauties two, covered with apparently real knowledge of marine salvage. A bit too contrived."
0,"Very, very disappointing book I would NOT recommed this book. Ive followed Kathy for nine years. Read her first book, whichwas okay. I ordered We Should be So Lucky fromQVC. I was so disappointed after reading it, thatI sent it back for a refund. I wont be buying anymore books by Kathy Levine."
0,"not for people that have MCS If you really suffer from chemical exposure, dont read this book. It will serve as one more denial of a real illness. Instead, I suggest you read an informative book that will guide you towards less exposure and alternative health care that can help, like Dr. Sherry Rodgers, etc. I was totally offended. Of course, any religious help is always helpful, but to deny the reality of MCS is just another slap in the face."
0,"DVD was for the wrong region The DVD sent to me was not for the United States. It was for region , so it would not play on any DVD player bought in the USA. I live in the USA. The billing address and address it was being sent to are in the USA. Very disappointing, since no where in the purchase was the region requested or noted. I threw the DVD away."
0,"not so good kanye is a good producer, not a good rapper. the only good about this album was that it had some decent beats but the rappin was horrible. kanye can not rap at all, the only reason he has so much hype is bc jayz signed him. kanye needs to stick to producin and give up his career in rap. dont waste your money on this album its not worth it."

For her winter vacation from work she is headed to New York for her cousin Marthas wedding. While on the plane, she is seated next to the charming and handsome Matt, the rock journalist, who is also recently divorced. They share their horror stories, and seem to becoming friends. Once they land in NY they decided to meet for an afternoon at the Statue of Liberty. After this point the book serisoulsy goes down hill. We are then treated to a cat and mouse game while Matt is looking for Josie. Throw into the mix an unbelievably lavish wedding, an affair or  depending how you look at it, an ex husband who comes toting an expensive gift to win back Josies affection, and a duck and it make a very unbelievable book."
0,"Couldnt grind Air One of the biggest wastes of money this year. Bought this to grind fresh corn grown in my garden. Attempted using this and it does not work. Finally ended up using coffee grinder to get the job done.  bucks down the drain.. trust the negative reviews on this one, the positive ones are probably from the vendor."
0,"Way Overpriced by over two and a half times value. I received my copy of this book today..its more of a small phamplet  pages in length than a book. No wonder the Table of Contents has not been included to be seen!!..giving the impression this is a real book and not a simple phamplet. On the back it is printedVital Health Publications, West Allis, WI ..Being charged . almost  times the price listedon Amazon was disappointing enough, however in addition, there was a sticker on the back cover stating Now ..I guess this is to give the consumer the idea that they really got a good deal of paying only . for a . phamplet that the price is only .!!! I definitely would NOT recommend this phamplet for what you get for the price...its a sham in my opinion. Id suggest you look for other books on ozone and hydrogen peroxide."
0,Love the product however the customer service sucks!!!!! I love this product however I will not purchase from this store again. I gave a low rating the first time due to the fact that when I received the product it was leaking and that the sprayer top was broken. I had to transplant what was left of the product into another spray bottle so I could use what was left in the bottle. I was contacted by the store and asked if I would take down my review and they would replace my order. I did and still have not received the replacement product. This was before Christmas. Would not order from here unless you want to get half of what you pay for.
0,"Metallica MOP.......The Cd that you know isnt good The Metallica Master of Puppets Cd is way below average. Songs like Batteries, Something Like You, and Suffocating inside of Jose are way too comercial. Metallica needs to go back to their roots. If you want a good Metallica album buy St. Anger."
0,"If the next ones this bad.... This book was nothing more than filler put out during a time when Jordan was getting hassled by fans and publishers. It did reveal a few interesting things which Im sure will be useful to know later, but all in all, this book could have come out a lot sooner, and I still would have been disappointed. Jordan has done an incredible job in keeping nonfantasy fans interested in his work now he has to do better."
0,"PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE SHOTTING Just a headsup to those thinging about these cameras. DONT USE THEM FOR ANY IMPORTANT PHOTOS! These cameras are used cases with new film added. I dont not recommed them, they are cheap, but be aware. Ive had problems with  different camerasI probably wouldnt buy again, but maybe, and wish Id read a review like this before taking them to Mardi Gras...oh well, who wants to remember a swamp tour in an fan boat anyway."
0,"Sadly Disappointed Having heard much about this composer, I was finally persuaded by one of the reviews here and ordered ASYLA. Ive listened to it numerous times and have to finally conclude theres nothing really new or fresh, or enjoyable or profound to be discovered here. It struck me as imitative of Michael Colgrassand not engagingly so. Im glad to have it in my collection, but Im afraid I will rarely give it a listen. Perhaps I was anticipating too much, hence my disappointmentbut Im far more likely to pull out Colgrasss AS QUIET AS if Im after inventiveness."
0,Dont Waste Your Money! I bought this movie when I worked in a movie store everyone said it was supposed to be better than Blair Witch. This is the most boring horrible thing I have ever seen. They have a public access show which they want to search for the NJ devil. The movie was just bad nothing exciting at all. Please be warned I wish I would have been.
0,"Followed by Helen Caldicott Peter Huber was on CSpan  last Sunday. He lets us know that  oil will not last since oil can be produced from Canadian sands for . It should be amusing to follow this prediction. Is he unaware of net energy questions and EROEI? He was followed by three hours of Dr. Helen Caldicott which believe it or not, was easier to take."
0,"Nauseating I was required to read this for my high school senior Philosophy class, and it is nauseating. Rachels hides behind the ostensibly noble endeavor of writing a book about moral philosophy, and uses it to defend homosexuality, abortion, and disregard for The Bible. He might as well title the book My Arguments Against Christianity, for that is really what it is. His skepticism when it comes to Christian faith and The Bible are only proofs that he is one of todays enlightened philosophers who is too intelligent to fall for the ridiculously simplistic beliefs of Christianity.This book is a terrible antiChristian screed, a total waste of time, and a sorry attempt at philosophy."
0,"Rusting... Nice clippers, but I paid their comparatively hefty price because they were advertised as stainless and I like to buy things that will last. The larger pair have multiple rust spots on them after less than six months. By definition, not made of stainless steel."
0,dont bother ok so this dvd sucks i wouldnt even give it away its so boring and gives me no motivation to wake up early and do it i also ordered gaiam yoga for weight loss and i love it get that instead dont waste ur money on this one im serious it has alot of the same moves as gaiam just without the weights and gaiam is perfect for beginers also..
0,"It looks a lot like a cool dog whistle The only problem is that it really doesnt work that well. If you use it around dogs, they really dont care about it and while it has a way to adjust the pitch of it, nothing works from the highest point to the lowest. Its not very silent either but at least its built pretty well and it has some nice features. In other words, it will make a great cheap gift if you want someone to think you spent twice as much on it."
0,"False Rebate The only reason I am not putting this product as a star because the product is actually good. However,  of the reason I bought this product instead of another manufacturer was because of the proposed rebate. The company is ridiculous because I send not only the UPC codes they require, but the entire box, and they send me a letter that they need the UPC codes. Obviously I dont have it because I sent it already. Try not to buy from Bosch. I already emailed and Facebooked my friends in case they ever buy something for their cars. Rebates are usually easily followtheinstruction deals, but this is the bad side about rebates because companies can screw you over and theres no recourse for you."
0,Piece of Junk I had this on medium for  days and it began to howl. Now it howls all the time and it is too loud to run it. For an expensive air cleaner it is cheaply constructed. The inner components are made out of styrofoam the type you see on a disposable beach cooler. Now I have to pay shipping both ways to the manufacturer to have it fixed. Stay away from this air cleaner.
0,"Not worth the effort We purchased this for our  month old Westie to use in the crate. Unfortunately, it is easily tipped and knocked over resulting in water all over, crate, dog and bedding. Didnt work out for us and returning would cost as much as the item. One of very few bad purchases on Amazon."
0,"Bucket of words I bought this book thinking it would roll smoothly and fluidly, engrossing me to keep reading until I was done. Unfortunately it has taken me  weeks just to get to page . Ms. Blake is the Don King of the Romance Writing World. There are so many nauseatingly long descriptions of every little detail from conversations to observances that I find it impossible to read more than  or  pages without getting frustrated. I want to get in to the story, Id like a little of the fantasy to be left up to my imagination. Ms. Blake is so long winded that I feel like Im reading a blow by blow narrative of a documentry, instead of losing myself in a historical fantasy life."
0,"A great work of art that implodes upon itself I served in the same mission as the author and couldnt put this book down. The arc of the story and the artful portrayal of missionary life in this fascinating place are nothing short of masterful and possess universal appeal. That is, until the last chapter, when the story descends into banality. Here the tale twists itself into fake spirituality that is engineered to appeal to brainwashed mormons. As the great nazi filmmaker Leni Reifenstahl showed us, there is a fine line between true art and propaganda."
0,"Game in not ready for the public! Even though FA. has possibilities, I can honestly say that in its current state it has too many bugs to be enjoyable. It seems that Jaleco rushed this product out too quickly. The game has been out for several months and still there has been no patches to fix any of the current problems. The constant scoring issues as well as the ineffectiveness of any of the game designers to keep the players apprised of any progress has driven many long time players and squads to other online games. I hope Jaleco can resolve the game issues soon.Rilak"
0,"Tin ear I was really disappointed with these expensive earphones. The reviews I read were pretty encouraging, but my own experience with these is overall pretty poor. Perhaps its my player, but other phones sound great. I tried to modify the acoustic settings, but could not produce any bass. They sound tiny and thin, and while the higher notes are the about best sound for any headset Ive used, there is no low end I eally like a strong bass, and these dont give it at all."
0,"Not as good as the first, but still a good read. As the heading says. I thought that this book felt a bit rushed or missed an edit somewhere, as characters and settings were not as fleshed out as the were in his previous book in this series."
0,"NOT for textured glass EDIT for clarityI purchased this to replace a similar one I use on my shower door which has a slight texture to it. The product did not work at all for my shower door, it left water behind after multiple attempts so I was forced to purchase another brand that works fine.This may work on flat glass and mirrors never tried but it still isnt very high quality, and I would not recommend it for anyone as you may need to purchase a second squeegee in the future."

0,Dont Bother I walked out after an agonizing  minutes. OK so the special effects are more modern the rest is junk. The socalled tribe on the island were strictly rd rate the actors are unknown to me no one with a reputation wanted to be in it or was the budget that low? It did nothing for me. By the way Cheaper be the Dozen did not do it either. Was I having a bad day?
0,"Worst Game of ? Maybe but it does definetly k! The game that was hyped for about a year is a majordissappointment because of four reasons The game is too much likeRE and RE. The game is so violent that you miss the point. The game is unoriginal, too much crap like its supposed to be scary. Are far as sound goes, its not scary and the game is accually in a sense silly because its just immature game that well, has no point!This games just not any good and it would be cool to see YOU buy a quality title such as Theme Parkif you find it Parappa the Rapper and Um Jammer Lammy. Also, if you want a frightful strategy game, you might want Echo Nightmaybe. Just dont be RE! DONT BUY IT AT ALL BECAUSE RE ISNT LIKE THE OTHERS! Crash Bandicoot also!"
0,disappointed I was disappointed in the interpretation of Johannas feelings towards her brother in law. From the letters of Vincent Van Gogh as well as the memoirs of Johanna Van Gogh it was my impression that Johanna was a stronger and more supportive person than this tale leads us to believe.
0,"What a Mess I do enjoy the coffee, and love the built in grinder. My major complaint is the awful mess generated by this coffee maker. It seems to leak from everywhere, including the handle. I finally had to pack it away, where I will most likely throw it out in my next big cleaning. Another smaller complaint would be that the coffee is not especially hot, but my biggest complaint is just the mess. I tried to convince myself for months that it was worth it, but it just is not worth having to clean my kitchen counter between the coffee maker and the sink and the floor as well every time I make coffee."
0,Power Failure My children received the Coby for Christmas and it was wonderful and worked great through  movies and the power would not come on. We sent it back and got another one and it only worked through one movie and the power did not come on. I would not recommend this product based on others having the same problems.

Then, the batteries just died...apparently. Opening the unit reveals  V watch batteries. Perfo brand.I repeat....Perfo. Doesnt even Google  try it! Perfo must be the Jack in the Box of watch batteries.In any event, I can either spend the  on  quality replacement batteries, or invest in a better product. Can you guess which way Im leaning.

I will give the author another try and see does she grow as an author, but this one was sooo far fetched and boring. Girl, please step up yo game. My girl read it too and she was bashing it, but I bought it because she usually exaggerates. She was telling the truth on this one."

I remember back when we had , Joe, Rkelly, Keith Sweat, Avant, Bryan Mcnight etc. etc. Well the search to find good enough quality rb material will continue for me but my advice to those who like Good music and are even contemplating getting this one here is just hold off cause im sure you can find something much better than this EVEN now!!!"

0,"Poor Attempt... I dont care if this book is supposed to illustrate the moral deprivation of the modern world... it is terrible. Other books that deal with the same sort of essential human sickness that The Serpent Club deals with usually have some sort of resolution that is, something that makes you put down the book nodding your head in agreement and fulfillment. This book leaves you shaking your head in disgust. I found no pleasure in this novel, becuase it is a case of depravation triumphing over reason and good, even in retrospect. Usually I have great respect for books this is the only one in memory that I have tossed straight into the trash when I was done reading it."
0,ouch! shock wo bark! My dog had a bad reaction to this device. The first time she had it on it seemed to do nothing and she barked as usual. Gradually her barking lessened but she barked once loudly and then began screaming. We tried again the next night with the same problem. This morning we gave it one last shot and after having the collar on for about  minutes she began screaming yet again. She had not even barked. She had been playing quietly and the collar shocked her anyway! She kept screaming and hopping around and when I finally got the collar off of her it was warm.
0,"This book is a waste of money  time! We had a copy of this book and took it with us to the Strawberry Lodge last week.What a mistake. Just go ahead and write sucker on your forehead and get it over with.First off, the author has changed information about the climbs, not to mention renamed some. This made the longtime locals of the area really mad and we found out how much.We had the book at the Lodges bar, and did we hear about the author and his dubious ways of earning a living.After hanging out in the area for a few days, we got all of the beta we needed about the local routes.I would not recommend this book to anybody. The only people who do, are friends of the author, so I dont expect unbias opinions from them."
0,"OK Sometimes Unit works well sometimes but other times barely if at all.Seems to work poorly on days with rain or heavy cloud cover think satellite TV signal problems.Also in cooler temperatures it will not lock on for  to  minutes, even though the batteries read and check well into the good.If the unit was on the dashboard or stuck to the roof of the car impractical, it might work fine. Inside the car though, the operation is intermittent.When it works, its pretty accurate. The software and reports are great.The magnet is very strong and will hold to any flat medal surface through a hurricane, I believe.Two stars may be a bit rough but if you were counting on the device to work every time from inside a vehicle, you would be disappointed."
0,"He swings and misses In purchasing this novel I had hoped to be entertained as much as I was when I watched Field of Dreams the adaptation of one of Kinsellas other novels. I enjoyed Field of Dreams so much, and enjoy baseball even more. That story moved me enough to indeed visit the movie site, as Terrence Mann says for reasons they do not understand. But I found that though this book was about a game which lasted over  innings it had little to do with baseball. It reminded me of something bordering on the works of Stephen King. I found that I had little sympathy for Gideon Clarke, or any of his fellow travelers. There is very little baseball action, the diamond only serves as a backdrop for this sorry characters flawed life. A novel it is, but not a baseball novel. Sorry."
0,Not what I was looking for I was looking for more of a resource for making this trip. This book went into more depth about the history of the region than the specifics of the trip. In general I was pretty disappointed with it.
0,"Hard as a BRICK My teenage son wanted one of these but after sleeping on it was really disappointed. It was hard and uncomfortable. It ended up getting shoved between the bed and the wall and several months later he found it and said it had softened up considerably. Still not great, though. Not sure whether to attribute the change to time or the fact that it was near the baseboard heat and the warmth softened it. Either way, who wants to buy a pillow and wait months for it to get comfortable? Well try another brand."
0,"Worst Iron Ive Ever Had Ditto to the last review. This iron worked well for two months. After that, the auto shutoff decided to really shut the iron off, whether you were using it or not.

0,"Buyer Beware!! I have just received this CD from Amazon and have found that, even though the names of the bands are all the same, the songs are NOT the original recordings  they are remakes. On the back of the CD jacket, in colored writing that partially blends in with the background color, in text so small that neither my wife nor I could read it without a magnifying glass, positioned at the very bottom on the back where you would normally only find manufacturing and copyright information, is the messageNew Stereo Recordings.The next CD in this series, , has the same problem but a different disclaimer again, printed in the same obscure manner as this one that is worded a little more honestly. It says,This album contains tracks that may be rerecorded by the original artist. Featured groups may not include all the original members.Buyer beware."
0,Boring Book This book put me to sleep. The book is far off the mark for practical application and is just all theory.Larry manages k.

Strategic and has tried to get on the bandwaggon with a second book.Pass on this book it is not close to being worthwhile.
0,"Beware  year Waranty I have used this router quite successfully since purchased with the exception of an occasional need to reboot. My gripe is realy simple, out of the blue the router stopped functioning which means I can no longer access the internet the unit is now ...hub because that still works. Linksys has a  year return policy and this is my th month with the product. They dont have an exchange, upgrade, or pay a fee for fixing the unit. I spoke to customer support and there was no flexibility,  year is  year. I now have to go out and purchase a new one all together.

0,"Mannered Like Emily Post I love Milt Jackson, but find this album a little too boring. Unlike his ripping work with Monk or plumbing beauty with MJQ, this album finds him doing standards at a snails pace. And theres less than  minutes of music here anyway, so youre better off looking elsewhere."

0,"Broke within  minutes of opening. I think this would be a great mechanical pencil, except that I never got a chance to use mine. It is literally broken into two pieces less than  minutes after opening it. I tried to turn the lead indicator, which was ridiculously tight, and the darned pencil just snapped in two right where the grip attaches to the main piece. Admittedly I probably shouldnt have been twisting it so hard, but they do advertise the lead indicator as a working feature.. I think this is a good if not great pencil, but the lead indicator feature is garbage."
0,"minor Matheson As a longtime Matheson fan, this book was a major letdown for me. The uninvolving story reads as soap opera of the worst kind. Also, it takes forever to move forward. The main character Erick takes almost  pages to realize that he is paralyzed on a bed. Most of the writing is downright amateurish. Matheson was quite young when he put pen to paper and, frankly, it shows. There is not a single glimpse of the brilliant writer that would later concoct the plots of such classics as I Am Legend or What Dreams May Come. This one remained unreleased for  years and, I am sad to say, should have stayed so."
0,"Buy something else I bought this machine for a small office and am not able to Scan documents not able to save scanned files on network computers Copy correctly from A to A prints in landscape instead of portraitFaxing works sporadically, printing over wifi has long delay.In addition, the screen that lets you configure the options isnt backlit so you cant easily see and understand what to configure.So far  computer engineers spent a total of  hours trying to get it to work and failed.I regret buying this printer and recommend you try other vendors  models."

0,"Do not recommend While they look fairly close to real teeth, applying them is tricky unless you have  handsand even then, its doubtful theyll live up to your expectation. Getting the gooky mix onto the teeth is messy. Its difficult to apply accurately. Though they seat over you teeth fairly well, you need to be extremely!! careful to make sure there is no extra goop anywhere in the gaps another reason a third handy is useful. They are very uncomfortable, even when trimmed, because the hard upper gum part sticks into your lip. Fitting your lip over the device isIMHOimpossible. I dont see how anyone can smile or use the upper lip normally with a protrusion like these teeth. Dont waste your money."
0,"Hack Ick  Im Melting This was the worst book Ive ever read. Although the book is incredibly descriptive and elicits a highly visual experience, the subject matter is demented and verges on something sadly insane. The author wrote as if she were bored and needed to add sick events to dramatize an otherwise quaint country story. The setting is realistic and the characters are believable. Somehow it didnt help that they were thrown together, and just when you think the story will get better or at least less disgusting, it DOESNT."
0,"Buyer beware Bought this to help plan a trip I am taking in the fall. I noticed a previous reviewer complained about an outdated reference in his edition to something that would happen in . But my copy was just issued in June , so that would not be a problem, right? Incredibly, it is still in the book! Either the book was edited by a chimp, or, more likely, the only thing that was changed was the publication date. Unfortunately, I bought the Kindle edition and am stuck."

0,Already in the trash can Gets one star only because Kling expended considerable effort in writing it. This is one of the worst books I have ever been conned into buying. Title is misleading.

0,"Not a Great Comedy or Drama I heard great things about this movie, but was disappointed that it didnt deliver on the comedy or drama aspects of it. Kiera Knightley is not a good actor and in this movie it looked like she was trying too hard on the comedy bits and it resulted in some overthetop acting moments. Steve Carrel plays his usual self. I didnt buy the romantic angle of it, and so the ending wasnt as heartfelt and affective for me as it should have been. The movie just didnt deliver on any level."

Talk about micromanagement. I spent more than  of my time taking care of whining villagers getting food and wood. Very distracting and aggravating when Id have rather played with the creature. Especially frustrating is the way the campaign messes with the creature. This takes away the only good part of the game and left me spending my time doing more village management. Ahhh!!!!"
0,It makes you feel inadequate I am sure the author has the nbest interest at heart... but I guess not being a mom herself she doesnt know how it feel to force a baby into a schedule!

0,Oreck Restaurateur for home use The Oreck Restaurateur sweeper did not pick up the sand and small pieces of dirt from either the wood floors or the carpet.

I had hoped the sweeper would be a quick fix to the problem.

0,"Cheap construction. Wouldnt buy again. I got this slicer as a Christmas gift for my brother and his wife. It came in the mail just a few days before Christmas. If Id had time to send it back, I would have. Other than the nice hefty block of marble, it feels like something I bought at the dollar store. The arm, plastic handle, and wire all seem prone to breakage and just feel cheap. There is a note on the bottom telling you how to align the wire with the slot...it says to simply slide the arm in or out of the block as needed. Theres no adjustment screw, or notched settings or anything...nothing to keep the arm in the right place once you have the wire aligned.Cheap cheap cheap."
0,"Dont waste your money! I recommend NOT purchasing this toaster for several reasons. First, and most importantly, it did not toast BOTH sides of the bread. A slice of bread that is not square will not fit into the toaster. And last of all, a strange design problem keeps the bread from going completely down into the toaster. It has a wire cage that grips the bread and pulls it down. The gripping action doesnt allow the bread to fall completely into the toaster so only the bottow s of the bread toasted. Also, the unit is large and bulky, it takes up way too much space on the counter for just a  slice toaster. The only thing deluxe about it, was the price. Way too much money for such a lousy toaster. I sent it back."

0,"Since when does not liking a book you like equal idiocy? I DID read all of this novel and I DID understand it and it was a shameful, sad spectacle. The characters and, hey, a novel is supposed to have them were more wooden than mannequins. The story, when finally discovered, sounds like a bad LSD flashback and a very silly one to boot. No one denies Pynchons intelligence. I do not deny the intelligence of the unabomber either. I just think what he wrote was tripe Like what Pynchon writes.I thought this novel was a complete waste of my time and it amazes me to hear so many praise what I think was paranoid and resembles silly cult literature. My father had a book back in the fifties sponsored by an extreme right wing group that was equally paranoid and absurd. The whole tone of that bizarre publication resembles the tone of Gravitys Rainbow. But at least the fifties book had some unintentional humor in it. Pynchon couldnt write anything funny if his life depended upon it."
0,"Too Preachy Im sorry, but this book was too preachy...and I go to church every Sunday. When the dad wishes all his children to be missionaries, when the book calls all Mormons evil, when nonbelievers are called heathens, etc. It just gets too judgmental and intolerant, it totally turned me off. The kids are so scared to do anything wrong and are so unrealistically good. It was not my kinda book...ICK!!!"

0,"juvenille writing I bought this expecting to like it. I agree with much of his politics, I loved his no war message during the academy awards and in general agree with him. However, he sounds better in soundbites than in a book. His writing is juvenilledumbed  down. Maybe he thinks everyone is stupid  and not just white men. While on the subject whats up with the retarded title. Maybe he feels guilty about being a white man and feels compeled to suck up to every non white male. The book would have been better in an essay or a long magazine article. But not much substance or credible facts backing his opinions."

0,"Very disappointed...must assemble many, many pieces I ordered two of these wine racks. I liked the simplistic design and looked forward to receiving them. When I did receive them, I first noticed that they came in pieces...about  pieces. The kit contained the wooden pieces and glue. The glue was dried up and unusable. The holes in the wooden bars were not drilled deep enough for the dowels, and the odd angle that the dowels had to go in made it even more difficult. I worked for about an hour before finally giving up and sending both units back for a refund. I would recommend purchasing a ready made unit and skipping this one."

0,Does not fit into airplane seats This combostroller works well as a stroller and is quite adequate as a car seat. It is quite easy to convert and fits through airport security scanners if positioned properly.My problems with it are. It is unusable in most Economy airline seats as it is too wide. I was made to check it in on  consecutive flights.. It is overpriced for something that is basically only a car seat stroller combo.
0,"Bag is too small for a  ft truss system I bought this to use with the Onstage  ft lighting truss system. If it were  inches longer it would be a three star bag. I ended up using it just to carry the tripods, and it is poorly designed even for that purpose. The carry straps are long enough that you could carry the case like a backpack, but the straps are so thin that they hurt horribly if you put them over your shoulders. Also the zipper is stops about  inches form the edge of each side. It should zip down the sides to allow the bag to lay flat for easier loading."

0,"Not a very Christian attitude towards others I was very impressed with this authors credentials......a bible scholar, a speaker a bible conferences, books recommended by Christians leaders and speakers. The first chapter was very interesting  about Ezekiel  then he really disappointed me. His writing was very antiCatholic. As I paged through the book, I saw this antiCatholic attitude throughout the book.I tossed the book into the rubbish. I couldnt even bring myself to send it back or to give it away as a donation. To me it was rubbish.I feel that if you are selling a book as scripture study or as a concordance, it should be just that, scripture study  NOT be full of antiCatholic statements."

Having all Macs, naturally I turned to the section on Configuring TCPIP in Macintosh computers and was absolutely gobsmacked to find it quite detailed with screen shots  for Mac OS ! You remember OS ? The one that was last released in ? The one for which upward compatibility was finally dropped when Apple went to Intel processors in , SIX YEARS AGO???Im sorry, but seriously? You havent been able to update the manual in this decade?No sale."
0,"Big disappointment. Ive been a diehard Makita fan for years. However, I was extremely disappointed with this compressor. Within a couple of days, one of the wheels snapped during normal use. Within a few months, the replacement for that wheel and the other wheel broke, both pivots for the locking levers on the handle sheared off, and the cooling fan worked itself loose and began eating at the housing.This compressor DOES NOT work on most  amp circuits it just hums and sounds as if its about to burn up. I comes from the factory with a low pressure setting. So if youre using a framing gun, it doesnt kick back on in time to have continuous nailing. There are adjustment screws for this inside the switch box, but that should not be necessary.Overall, I think Makita should go back to the drawing board on this one or risk losing many longtime customers."

0,"Better Without Material Mom Just heard this at a friends place  it has a few interesting tracks, but nothing really special. I give it  star for including Beth Orton. Madonnas bastardization of one of the most beautiful, haunting pop tunes in history is simply abominable. Shes turned Don McLeans folkrock masterpiece into an electronica Get Into the Groove clone. Good Lord! The questionable ratings so far here on this album  especially the reviewer below who made the dubious lyrics comment just goes to show the mentality of most Madonna fanatics. If you really want some cuttingedge music, try Becks Mutations or the soundtrack to the film The Insider  both excellent!"

This seriously sounds like songs they recorded during Rollin Stoned but werent good enough to put on that albumand Rollin Stoned, a great album, was still their weakest effort. All the rap songs seem to have the same generic beat as did the Rollin Stoned album. Gone are the head bobbin beats of ROYAL HIGHNESS and HIGH SOCIETY. DLoc just sounds like he doesnt even give a shi on this album. The punk songs are annoying. The only really standout track I thought was bring it on. If your a KMK fan, you know your gonna cop this, but just be warned, contrary to what duder from Alabama says...its their weakest effort."

0,"Catty Women Ugh. I was a huge fan of Olivia Goldsmiths First Wives Club and even though this is written by a different author, thought it might be a fun tale of the other side of the coin. I couldnt have been more wrong. Four vapid, selfabsorbed women who, each in their own way, cut a married man from the herd and roped him in through deceit and sexual conquest, get together once a month to kvetch about the first wives and whine. This read like a bad soap opera with none of the women experiencing any real growth or moments of selfrealization. Even the conflicts are solved by happenstance, not by any mature action by the characters. The razor sharp wit described in the blurb is nonexistent. The only time I laughed was when one of the protagonists got hit by a car. And that was because I was thrilled to see at least one of these catty broads got knocked down. A miserable read."
0,"Junk or Bad Quality Control OK so after reading the mixed reviews here for this item, I figured there was more good reviews than bad ones, so I gave it a try.First off no matter what I did the unit would not sync. Yes I can read instructions. Transmitter first blah blah, no auto detection. I attempted the manual sync, again nothing.Then I though I would try the Transmitter since it reads out a display. One of the sensor probe does not change on the transmitter unit. After  minutes of cooking it had not changed a degree yet, still at . Impossible I though. I checked with my thermonitor I know that works, sure enough it was So have a unit that is broken in two different ways.Yes I will return it, Thanks Amazon....and attempt at another unit.However with many of the other bad reviews where it would not work out of the box, I would say Quality Control on this item is pretty bad, which is why the one star.Will update on my replacement"

0,"Not as good as the original Basicaly the only decent stuff I see here are tracks ,, and . Seven is the coolest theme ever  the one from the WipeoutXL game intro videothe whole reason I got this CD and the first track is also mixed in there somewhere. Number  is just a more or less decent techno track, while  is Prodigys Firestarter without the vocals. Track  was a dissapointing dulleddown version of Flukes Atom BombId give the CD  stars if they just put the excellent original one. So there you have it, unless you desperatly want the WipeoutXL intro flick music which wasnt included on the game CD  dont bother. Better get the WipeoutXL game itself  its out for PSX and PC and has the great game and music all in oneskip the first data track. You can also play the PSX version with an emulator and get the same resolution. But the PC version is the best."

Yes the childrens voices are wonderful, but all the songs are slow, kinda sappy and sound alike. The songs from Lilo  Stich were incredible but now it appears thats more due to Mark Kealii Hoomalu wonderful song and lyric writing ability. What a creative person he must be along with his original hula style. If you really liked the music from Lilo  Stich maybe thell pair Mark up with the choir again for the Sequel!!!!"

0,"Abysmal Durability, Poor Warranty I loved my Kindle until I took it out of my backpack and its screen was frozen in a weird, glitchy image. It was the only thing in bag and other than picking it up and putting it down, it suffered no great trauma. Amazon claimed it was my fault and charged me for a replacement, but I think that its a design flaw for a portable device to be so breakable. Even if you do buy this, be warned that you should treat it more like a fragile laptop than a mobile phone or, you know, an actual book.Also, there are real problems with battery life  it worked as advertised for about a month, at which point a daily charge suddenly became necessary. Amazon touts the fact that eInk doesnt need power to hold an image, but after about a month of use, the Kindle could barely make it through a night without losing all power and yes, the wireless switch was off."

I always enjoyed the weekly television series MASH, so I was quite shocked to discover that the movie version of MASH is a piece of garbage, which is where my copy ended up. My first shock was to discover that the catchy little tune they play at the beginning of every show is actually a song about suicide being painless. Next, one of the characters is mocked for praying. The worst scene is where they mock the Last Supper during a fake suicide. Enough said!"
0,"Georgie Porgie, puddin pie, hosed the fans and made them cry What never ceases to amaze me is the lot of boneheads who think old school SW fans want inferior quality. No, you dopes. No. All the  star reviews are from people who want the highest possible quality of the original content. Content! Thats the complaint! Clean the films up, make the sound better, but dont change the story. Geez, its tough to make some folks understand something so simple. George understands it, believe me. Hes just got too much pride to admit his alterations detracted from the magic of the original movies, so you cant have those except in bad form. But George is no dummy when it comes to money. Would you leave millions of dollars on the table when its right there for the taking? All hes got to do is give the fans who built his franchise what they want. Then hell be a big hero. The fans will sing his praises and hell make tons of money. The whole thing will be put to rest. Its a winwin."
0,"Not very well written I usually like older books for kids, and the facts in the book were interesting, but the tone and style was offputting. Short, choppy sentences as if speaking to a six yo, but the content well above the head of a six yo.

0,"AWFUL! I took ONE dose of this probiotic and had SEVERE diarrhea, gas, nausea, vomitting and a putrid taste in my mouth. I have a chronic health condition that requires me to be on antibitoics sometimes IV frequently. During the latest round, I was having more than the usual GI problems, so I thought a heftier probiotic might be in order. After doing some research and receiving a personal recommendation, I purchased this product. I not only wasted , but I am also in considerable discomfort. I dont doubt that this product works for some people, but considering the potential side effects, it is NOT worth the risk!"

I gave  stars, not because the product is poor, but because they are of no use to me!"
0,"For Kids I recently purchased this book for  cents  shipping. I should of waited for a yardsale. I have no experience in cartooning. This book is better for young children. Gives examples of what you can do, but no instructional guidelines. The tip off is that it is published by Scholastic. Considering most adults buy online I gave  star for teenadult.  star for young children."
0,"This could have been a good book  but it isnt. Great photos  nice quilts. That is, unfortunately all I can say good about the book, and there are a lot of better buys out there with nice quilt photos. These selfappointed experts have added little to the body of available information on vintage quilts. If these three are appraising quilts then I wonder about the program that sponsors them due to the fact that book is full of inaccuracies. Discussion on how they arrived at the values and many are questionable is lacking which would be nice seeing that is their area of expertise. It is almost like they pulled the numbers from a hat. The book does little to promote the credibility of the authors and certainly isnt the publishers best effort, its just a pretty price guide that unfortunately like all price guides was out of date the day it was released."
0,"Peee uuuu! I wasnt expecting perfection from a Pixar knockoff, but at least show some class. The jokes were trashy and many had sexual references that surprised me, since it it geared at kids. The characters were overly cliche and very annoying. The main character had a very lowself esteem in regard to his love interest. I understand that many kids movies have subtle jokesreferences geared at adults. The key word is subtle.Thats all I know because I turned it off after  minutes. Also there was a plot error  on the box it says the champion hasnt lost a race in  years, but in the movie the  of years is different. I guess they skimped on editors... and everything else about the movie.Guess I could use the disk as a coaster."
0,"It got bogged down Normally I really like series. For instance, I thought Millenium, the Badlands, Day of Honor, Captains Table, and the New Frontier series were all great. But I have to admit, this one got boring, confusing, and had a strange ending. Too much technobabble made it get bogged down as they try to move the moon. It wasnt very original, either. The character developement needed some help. I normally like Diane Carey, but wow, this one I could have done without."
0,"Good idea  not practical I too am a writer. I thought after a few months that I would become accustomed to the keyboard. I havent. It is a neat idea, but after  years of using the standard QWERTY keyboard I have not been able to make the transition to this style. In typing this I made  mistakes. It is too easy to hit multiple keys, and the force needed to press the space bar and some of the keys is unnatural. I would not recommend this keyboard. But then, Microsoft is not known for their hardware."
0,Dont order through Bealls I ordered this from an Amazon Marketplace seller called Bealls which is a department store in Florida. They said that it was in stock.

I had not received any notice that Bealls had canceled the order.

I tried to find an email address or a website for the company that released this DVD, but was not lucky in my search. My advice to anyone who is into Kung Fu flicks is to stay away from anything distributed by VideoAsia."

0,"Buy a different Alex set!!! This set is sooo disappointing! I love the other Alex kits, specifically the bug set and sea critters lacing set. This one just stinks!First of all, the different animals are not divided into kits, and no instructions are provided. So you get a box of a lot of pieces of random colored paper, tissues, googly eyes, stickers, feathers, pipe cleaners, etc, but no clue on how to use them. You end up with a small child grabbing at everything and making a random critter with a huge mess.The other Alex kits that divide into separate sections are much better for a busy mom. Also, note that once this box is opened, theres no way to organize it all.The stickers in it are like superglue, theres no way to reposition them if the kids stick them to the wrong spot, which is sort of likely for this age, so things just go wrong once you open the box."
0,very misleading I purchased this for my grandson  he had it on his wish list. Even after reading the description of the item it doesnt say it was just an attachment to a helmet. I think the company had better rewrite the production description. My grandson has no use for this without a helmet. I hope other customers read this review before buying anything from this website.Mislead customer.
0,"Strong Bass But Bad Trebble and Muddy Sound Well, I bought this product because I read the good reviews from other amazon shoppers. I was a bit disappointed by the sound delivered by this system. I use them to listen to MP music on the net and that does not work well. The bass is strong and tight at low volume but becomes very loose when it is cranked up. The trebble is never good. I used the MS media player equalizers to adjust but that did not improve the clarity of sound. If you use this system to play video games which I did not, you may find these speakers do a good job. But using them to listen to online music is whole different story."
0,"Destroying a great comic book for the sake of Keanu Reeves. Constantine is a very bad adaptation of the Comic book called Hellblazer and when I say bad, I do mean bad. It really desecrates what the comic book stood for and shows that Hollywood only cares about themselves, not the fans. Keanu Reeves literally gives the worse performance of his career in this film and most of the actors around him follow his path. Only Rachel Weisz and Djimon Hounsou gives good performances in this heap of junk because they at the very least tries their best with the very bad script that they had to work with while Keanu and the rest of the actors ham it up to the hill.See it for their performances alone"
0,"Disappointing I bought this for my husband because of the blurb on the cover saying it would be a favorite gift to husbands from their wives. If she wants her husband to believe she needs to repent if she is not always as eager for sex as he is so that he can then graciously forgive her, she should buy him this book. Or if she wants to be viewed as weak and easily deceived and treated in a condescending and controlling way she might want to give this to her husband. Priolos interpretation and application of Scripture often out of context is highly questionable in many instances and directly leads to these extreme views.Also, the publisher did a very poor job with glaring typos and difficulttoread, extremely small type. Cheap looking and not the thing I want to give anyone as a gift. I threw it in the garbage. Best place for it."
0,"It is a videogame not a movie. This is a terrible movie. I love the original star wars trilogy, but this movie is horrible. The acting is stiff, the dialogue is dead and the computer generated graphics are overwhelming, did I mention that the music is nothing special?. It looks and feels more like a videogame than a movie. TERRIBLE."
0,"a disappointment The only good think about this is the story the actors are horrible. I expected more from both, specially Orson Wells. It is black and white or the technical quality, although the sound was bad I had to turn my volume to  to hear it passably but those were not the only reasons I did not like it. Jane Eyre was supposed to be , not thirty and Joanne Fontaine could never act, Orson Wells was always glowering and abrupt."
0,"On Picking Fruit While often funny, the book seemed to have an underlying theme of negative gay stereotypesmany of the characteris were loose canons, and I grew tired of the silly thoughtless behavior of the major character, who was so deetermined to meet the right persion that he would do almost anything.

0,"One of my least favorite Floyd albums I know some people rate this record very highly, but I cant join the chorus on this one. More is one of the slightest, most inconsequential albums Pink Floyd ever recorded. It was a soundtrack for a Barbet Schroeder film, and in its original vinyl configuration, Side Two consisted mostly of forgettable instrumentals. Side One was better, with three tracks written by bassist Roger Waters that were rather engaging  Cirrus Minor, Green is the Colour and Cymbaline. Overall, though, this album rarely rises above mediocre, and suffers the same fault many movie soundtrack albums suffer  the work comes off as incidental music that, when separated from the film, simply does not stand up on its own."
0,"the worst software ever I recently purchased a new computer. The dictionarythesaurus software I had been using for several years did not work very well with the new computerand windows . I had been looking for something new and updated I thought the MerriamWebsters Collegiate Dictionary and Thesaurus would be a good choice and Amazon as usual offered a good price. I was wrong on my choice of software. I spent over four hours trying to get it loaded and getting it to work. I have twentyfive years with computers, both at work and at home I have never experienced this much trouble with any other software in the past fifthteen years. After four hours of total frustration I gave up, called Amazon and complained. The Amazon representative was quick to arrange for a return of the product and a credit for my purchase. MerriamWebster gets a one star, only because that is the lowest offered Amazon.com gets five stars for not adding further to the problem. Thank you Amazon.com."
0,"Hohummm If youve read any of Jacques books you already know this one.It reads as if he has been intimidated by adultsparents who do not think that children can handle the natural outcome of battle and think children should be protected at all costs.Heres the news folks, the fight of good against evil is not without cost. Im with C.S.Lewis in saying dont take away the dragons, but show the knight that can slay them.This tale meanders, wanders, introduces pointless characters and events that have nothing to add to the progress of the tale.You want to read Jacques, go back and read his early work, then youll have a much more satisfying tale."
0,"Simply evidence that Ebert no longer watches the movies he reviews. That Ebert gave this horrible movie a thumbsup is courtpresentable evidence that he didnt even watch it. This is a horrible movie. Cheap sets, poor lighting, unrealistic costumes, and I just named its good points. The acting in this movie was as bad as the dialogue. None of these actors or actresses really should work again ... or at least until theyve gone through acting school again. As for the plot, it isnt even laughable. It is just a groan fest. This is Carpenters first movie after ten years and it just proves that making a good movie isnt like riding a bicycle. You do forget how to do it. John Carpenter definitely did. Do not buy this DVD. Do not rent it. Do not even borrow it from your public library for free. If the rating system could allow negative numbers, Id give this movie . It isnt as bad as Battlefield Earth, but it isnt that far behind either."
0,"Im forcing myself to pick up the book and continue on! Oh, I dont know, maybe I overanticipated after anxiously waiting all these years. With Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs, those books were read in one day and reread over the years. So far, not the same with Hannibal. Good points to this tale are the obvious research put into the life of Hannibal in Italy, but for the most part, the other characters have yet to make me give a hoot. Reading some of the other reviews here make me wonder if Ill even bother going the distance. Oh, I will, but will probably regret it."

0,"Skip this book As other reviewers have said, its shallow, riddled with errors, and ultimately unsatisfying. Yet it mentions a lot of incidents, some of which Id never heard of, like the Queen Mary colliding with her escort. This books salvation would be a good bibiography, so the interested reader could follow up  but there is none. No notes. Nothing. For a good book of this sort, read From the Jaws of Victory, by Charles Fair."
0,"Incongruous Logic  terrible direction I watched this movie up until Hillary, who appears in every way intelligent, decides that the demand of her sister, who, after running naked into the woods, is found shivering and out of her mind, should be allowed to have sex with Hillarys husband! The reason? Because she needs to know somebody LOVES her???? I thought the idea that sex  love was something most adults realized was not necesarilly true about the time they found out what the word prostitution means.I understand the musical aficionados have their own bone to pick, but I found the incongruous logic that would allow an emotional lunatic which Jackie certainly was at the point of adultery to have her way with Hillarys husband with Hillarys blessing was to allow the lunatic to run the asylum because the emotionally damaged sister requests it to be too much to swallow, and i shut the movie off."
0,"BattleTech fans beware! After slogging through the book with its rather mediocre writing, I perosanlly found the ending both unbelievable and unsatisfying. After walking across the room to pick up the book where I had hurled it with great force moments before I reread it hoping I had been wrong. Nope. It was still a poor ending. I had expected some grand battle to finish off the story, but not one in which all major characters both good guys and bad guys all walk away. All right, one was horribly burned. But no one paid that ultimate price for freedom or in payment for some rather terrible crimes talked about but rarely shown in the novel. Kenson should stick to ShadowRun."
0,"Child molesters only need read I dont know which is more sickening  this book or the rave reviews for it, esp. the one that praises it for showing the positive side of manboy love.I saw the outstanding film by Gibson whose movie The Passion of the Christ was a true masterpiece then decided to read the book. What a difference! In the film we have a noble soul, the teacher, who has had his life ruined by false accusations. In the book we have a pervert who rapes little boys. There is no justification for praising such a book, no matter how eloquent. Artsyfartsy comments like literature shouldnt be poured through a moral filter dont justify it nothing justifies it. The book should have ended with the teacher being strung up to die that was the fate he deserved...."

However few mentioned that there are known issues between GoBack and Ghost , which are part of Norton SystemWorks  Premier, and Microsoft .Net Framwork .. I asked them why would Norton sell software with known issues and why hasnt it come out with a patch to fix these issues.

0,"Average This movie is your average Black Emanuelle outing. I bought it because it has my two favorite soft core run around naked actresses. It doesnt go quite as far as Emanuelle In America, but its better than others. The transition to DVD isnt bad, and its not as hard to come by as it used to be. I only recommend it if youre addicted to these two girls."
0,"great theme but unfortunate attempt This book was painful to read. Although the writing was at times quite wonderful  clear images and interesting situations  its myriad characters, strange interactions and weak and often byzantine plot made this a real chore. All of it seemed very forced and contrived. I had to read it for a book group  otherwise I would have never finished it. On a more positive note, the author can write but seems to need more clarity in her views and in what she really wants to say to the reader. I am not sure she knows exactly what she wants to say herself otherwise this massive and heroic attempt to write the great novel would have been less tragic."
0,"No new ground broken here. Been there, done that... It is appaling to hear those who say this is new and original groundbreaking stuff. I dont think so. Just listen to Bartz, Laraaji, Vangelis, Larry Fasts Synergy, and Eno. These soundscapes have been explored and created before. Just because Thom Yorke mixes in some disjointed vocals and a bit of simplistic bass in there does not a groundbreaking release make! This has got to be the most pretentious, boring carbon copy music ive ever heard. A great cure for insomnia. The masses have been fooled once again."
0,"THE RAP INDUSTRY IS MODERN SLAVERY There is a slasher killing rappers and amazingly enough the cops are out looking for the guy. Two policemen take on the case. Good cop, Det. Johnson James McDaniel a black man who knows very little about rap and the white Det. Francelli  Michael Mosley who is curiously a walking rap encyclopedia and also plays the bad cop.The slashing is mostly at the beginning of the film. At this point it turns into a lengthy whodunit with street interviews for filler material and a Spike Lee message. The production attempts to roll but then sputters on dialouge. The film needed to properly space out the killings and a more thrilling way to connect the dots. Like so many st century AfricanAmerican productions, this film was long on dialouge and short on action. Some acting would have helped.Parental Guide Fbombs, Nword, no sex, no nudity, some implied sex."

Some times I wonder if reviewers, too didnt get it but were afraid to say so, because this conglomeration of words is just that  a pointless, incomprehensible waste of trees.I will accept my own intellectual fallibility and write this one off to my bad.

0,"A definite must NOT read. Chafer rambles endlessly. Could have covered all  pages in about . Every subject covered is interpreted through Darbys dispensational rapture theory that was introduced in the th Century. In the th chapter, he even goes so far as to suggest that the writers of Scripture were confused. I guess he should have been there to set them straight. If you buy into the th century theory of the rapture, this book is for you. If not, this book is torture. A better title would have been Darbyism .There are many good books out there which give an accurate overview of Scripture. This is NOT one of them."

0,"dont use! I registered for these they seemed like a good idea at the time. But when my son was old enough to crawl and take the toys out of them the basket would break into little pieces that he could swallow.

The paper out light is perpetually on now, on both units.

0,"Terribly disappointing Wow. From the first line of this comedy, I knew it was going to be bad. I had heard some great things, so naturally I had to see it. What a disappointment. I found my self smiling twice, and laughing only once, and that was a completely banal scene where Napoleons attempt at a bike jump results in the ramp crumbling uder him and him crashing. Point is, it had nothing to do with the story, and could have been in any film.The only saving grace, and in my opinion the only scene worth watching, was the climax, which sees Napoleon defying his nerdiness to put on a great dance routine.I didnt expect much going in after all, its an MTV movie. But I have to say given the choice, Id watch Beavis and Butthead  times out of  before Napoleon."

0,"variations on a poet A selected poems translated by various translators has always seemed to me a questionable undertaking as it erases the overarching style and power of the poet. That is certainly the case here. Some translations are brilliant and capture the unique feel for the labyrinthine mind of Borges, while others are flat or prosaic or simply uninspired. This unevenness inevitably shadows the poet, and creates the impression of arbitrariness in Borges as a poet."

0,"Doesnt Deliver the Goods This book does not deliver the goods promised in the title. It turns out that one of Glynns pieces of evidence is nothing more than the anthropic principle which notes that we live in a very unlikely Universe. Change any one of several fundamental constants of physics, and the Universe could no longer support life. However this reasoning is akin to the winner of a lotto ticket noting that if any of his numbers changed, hed not be a winner. Hence God must have been behind his winning. Even if you grant the supernatural, the anthropic principle cannot be used to claim that we humans are the intended purpose of the entire creation. This isnt evidence at all. Carl Sagan, tongue in cheek, formulated a lithic principle because rocks could assume that the entire creation was intended for them."

A few scenes werent how the Bible depicted it but no doctine was damaged by the changes presented. It was basically the language. The wrestling scene was poorly done and Esaus reaction to Jacobs return wasnt presented  Biblical but no harm there. The best feature was the representation of the family dinamics between the sons and their parents... especially Jacobs actions at the coersion of his mother, but the language prevents me from sharing it freely with my children or other church members."
0,"Unsuitable at any price Oh, where do I start? Well, lets start with the grinder. The grinding unit is plastic with a coarse finish, that the grinds cling to, causing probably  of them to remain in the grinder. This requires you to disassemble the grinder and clean it thoroughly for every pot. This issue also causes the coffee to be very weak. The grinder makes an ungodly amount of noise it literally scares small children. Grinds will get caught in the latch for the basket causing it to spring open while brewing. This, in turn, causes the brewpause valve to close, even though water continues to reach the basket, overflowing it all over the floor. Try grinding your own beans? Dont grind them too fine, and make sure you dont put in enough for a decent pot of coffee as it will overflow the basket.On the plus side?. Digital clock keeps decent time. The Carafe is actually very nice. The cheap plastic makes a delicious crunch as you smash it to pieces."
0,Moving filter clogs My first use of this vacuum was great but after using it for a few months I found the self cleaning filtration system to be a big headache. The filter moves round and round to clean itself but pulls up debris and dog hair into the filter. The filter clogs and stop moving and has to be manually cleaned after every use. The vaccum dose such a great job cleaning that the filter cant handel the dirt. It is very messy to empty the canister and continually clean out the filter. The filter is a permanate part and you have to bring your cleaner to hoover to get it serviced.I am going to purchase the bagged version and replace this one.
0,"Wretched album Just as some may confuse an amature photograph with an artful one simply because its in black and white, New Found Glory have confused mature music with sad, crybaby songs. They seem to have Jim Carreys disease. Too bad."
0,"Dissapointing I have been hesitant to review this book for a long time.This is a very rudimentary book that deals almost exclusively with the small circulation or sometimes called the Small Uiverse.The author used incorrect termininology for the Conception Qi vessel, and is unaware of the difference between Qi vessels and meridians."

0,"Super disappointing Like many of you, Im a big Savage Garden fan. But please dont force yourselves to like Darren because of that.The title track Insatiable is good, but the rest of them stink. My advicejust buy the single! Darren cant have the chemistry just by himself without Daniel. After all,I mean the whole is more than its sum in Savage Garden."
0,"not a great video this video is a bust!..it may be good for people who are just getting off the couch, but is certainly isnt much of a workout..and the absolute worse thing about this video is Leslies endless babbling about NOTHING...she sounds like a teenager gossiping! ..I do not want to hear about how one of the associates had a baby  months before! or any cutsie comments about being a new mother!and if I ever play the video again, I will again get the babble about the baby who is still  months old!...and then there are the numerous times that an associate will throw in a ridiculous comment about how they are feeling the workout in their different muscle groups  but no one is getting any cardio workout and no one is sweating including me!..this is the only video I have ever muted... none of the associates, or Leslie herself, got their firm bodies by doing only Leslies walk tapes!..there are better videos for beginners.... dont waste your money"
0,"Not quite the right fit I have a G Zen Xtra and purchased this battery to replace my tired old battery. The replacement doesnt fit snuggly  it is smaller in size than the original battery.

0,"You cant make a good movie with a bad book Well, I havent read the book, but its probably airport trash. Barbara Covett? Bathsheba Hart? Steven CONnelly? Were talking Joan Collins level, or a bodice ripper that Fabio is on the cover of. Im amazed that two great actors would find anything to give of themselves to this exploitative, prurient stupidity. Only in terms of taboo breaking does this film have any impact. Cate Blanchett makes out with a  year old, and Judi Dench is a vampiric,creepy,aging lesbian. Both are teachers at an English high school and Dench lures the confused Blanchett into a bizarre relationship using her knowldge of Cates teen tryst as leverage. I dont know if these actors are stretching their boundaries or naive, or both, but if you like a good train wreck, oh, baby, is this the right flick for you."
0,Please Buy This If You Like Bad Acting and Cheap BackDrops This movie is sooooo bad that I had to turn it off. The acting is horrible and it looks like it was filmed in someones basement. They didnt even show hot sex! No way! Boring and no depth whatsoever! Stay away!
0,"not very happy with the sound they produce I ran these headphones thru my iphone,my receiver,my iphone with a headphone amp fiiO E and they still sound horrible.They sound like they need more highs,mids,and lows .I had to bring the volume all the way up on all my attempts.I really like the way they look and feel, but i had to send them back. For the price i paid i thought they would sound much better."
0,"some scenes reminded me of the fatal attraction In my opinion Beyonces performance was not convincing, for example Elbas character after he was drugged and the other woman slept with him, Elbas character and Beyonces character were arguing and Elbas character said, where do you want me to go? and Beyonces character said, to hell, until then go to the four seasons, take your toothbrush. I was like okay that didnt make sense and plus that ugly baby that was in the movie, they could have least pick a better looking child."
0,"... Unbelievably bad. The author is suffering from terminal paranoia. He believes that the media suffered irreparable damage during the Gulf War because they didnt have access to all the information they wanted from the military. It doesnt occur to him that the media, with their blatant liberal slant, cant be trusted to handle information and report it responsibly. This is the same who thinks that Ted Turner is courageous  the same bigoted Ted Turner whos been nailed time and again for hypocrisy. Lastly, MacArthur has virtually no technical academic or professioanl credentials to make many of the satements he does regarding military technology. His assessment of weapons such as those used in the Gulf War is pathetically inept. Dont waste your money. You can become better informed by reading a Tom Clancy novel."
0,"Who gives this guy money to make this crap? I saw this on some cable channel. OK, no story line, no structure. Lots of cliched dream sequences. The usual Lynch stuff, audio run backward, film sped up. Overpaid, well past the A list, actors, who at times seem comatose. Who really wants to remember Richard Pryor this way? Like most of Lynchs later work it is nothing more than a visual presentation of a bad seizure. The mystery for me is never his movies, but who finances this crap?"
0,"Dissappointed.... I have never read anything written by Hannah Howell, found this book at walmart, which it souded good when I read the back cover.

0,"This book is an intellectual insult to all readers. I approached this book with great anticipation. I was not expecting first rate writing but I thought the storys premise was intriguing and anything had to be better than the latest Danielle Steele trash. Wrong. The storys premise was intriguing, the story line was not. The writing was unbelievably bad, the character development was nonexistent, the dialogue was beyond stilted, the science was poor, the ending was...there are no words to adequately describe the sheer silliness of that ending. I cannot believe this guy got published. And where the heck was his editor? Readers should have the right to sue a publishing company for malpractice. Throw this fishy tale back"
0,"Well... Depressing, real but somthing missing! I think the story in total was depressing and I kept asking myself why she didnt do anything prodoctive with here life. But I kind of got the answer when she finally left her small village to visit her aunt. She was just a scared small town girl, thats were I found the book real. I have alitle problem identifying what is missing but I guess I just found the book boring. I also think that it dint build it self up enough for the dramatic ending. The ending I found not in harmony with the rest of the book...to unreal! If I have nothing better to do with my time I might pick up a book by Jane Hamilton again! Arni"
0,"just plain disappointed Let me start off by saying that I am a fan of Shyamalans previous movies, especially Unbreakable. But, I honestly dont know how anyone that has seen this movie can give it anything more than two stars!The pace was extremely slow. The story was obvious and very predictable. The dialogue was painful to hear.This movie is neither worth the time nor the money. Wait for it to come on cable and youll thank me for it.I have to end by saying that I was extremely disappointed."
0,"A cynical release MitchellI cannot recommend this dvd.For starters, the picture quality is abominable. Its almost an insult to the buyer.Secondly, Reel Enterprises have cut a lot in this film.In the original version we can see how sexually active Miss Evans is, even to the point where she gives head.But I guess that later on Miss Evans regretted her spontaneity and applied to the courts for an injunction against these sexually explicit scenes. Succesfully, I might add.I feel Ive been had.Verdict a cynical release."
0,"Disappointing I am sorry. In my opinion this book is a waste of paper. I havetried to find some answers to simple questionsabout ASP in this book. Things concerning littlethings one might forget and you want to look up.After a few times using the book in this way its clear this book tells us little useful things. Even free digitalpsd manuals on ASP are a lot more useful. Afterbuying this book from amazon it went quite quickly to a dump shop, sorry..."
0,"rd dead one I got a B for Xmas and it kept shutting off on its own, so I returned it for another B. It had the same problem. Then I found all the reviews that said the B was defective, so I tried the B. Same problem again, it wont brew unless I take out the water reservoir and put it back in. Repeat process for each cup you want to brew. The auto turn on feature doesnt work because of this, so dont expect a hassle free cup of coffee in the morning. Definitely not worth it."
0,Poo Poo When this came out I sold all of my merchandise and found heavier bands like Slayer to pick up the slack.

0,"Just got mine in The color is random, I dont know if the seller chose or if it was a mistake, but mine was not blueit was pink. The battery didnt work at all but the ac adapter did, so I guess thats something. For  bucks you cant go wrong, especially since they really dont make stuff like this anymore. I wish the battery pack had worked though... Oh well.Overall stars.Minus one for not being able to choose the color, minus  for battery pack not working, minus one for the inconvenience that it was. Take your chances if you really want to, but Id just buy rechargeable batteries instead."
0,"Too weird for my taste After watching the movie Donnie Crapo, I mean, Darko, it seems more clear to me, why the minds of so many people are totally screwed up. Lets face it, the only reason why this movie deserves at least a two star rating is because of the awesome songs and fascinating musical arrangements. The rest of the film could be accurately filed under Garbage Productions."

If you dont speak Korean, youre out of luck if you want to find a particular movie, you have to rifle through all of the cases as theyre labeled only in Korean. Very annoying, especially at the price I paid. Dont waste your money wait for a better edition to come out."
0,"Keep in mind, original remotes are needed The reason I decided to buy the OmniRemote for my Visor was that I had lost most of my remotes for my electronics on a move recently, and I thought this could replace them all quickly and easily. To my disappointment, I soon realized that all original remotes were needed to program this module. So I ended up having to go to WalMart and buy another universal remote, program it using the included codes, and use that Universal Remote to program the OmniRemote. What a waste of time, effort and money. The Sony Universal remote I bought was much easier to setup and use, it costed about  less, and none of the original remotes were neccesary because a list of manufacturers codes was included. Why the OmniRemote doesnt include such a list of codes is beyond me. The OmniRemote is only a wise buy if you already have all your remotes and you dont want to keep any of them on your coffee table."
0,"Oh my goodness, that was STUPID!!!! Not stupid good either. I watched it because I had heard of John Waters before and I am a fan of Chris Issacs music. I really went into it not knowing what to expect other than Waters is known for pretty eccentric and absurd movies. That would be fine if it was any good.The movie looked like it was shot with a Flip Video Camera instead of professional equipment. The dialogue was worse than some of my th grade students put into their short stories. And the idiotic plant, animal, tree, etc. animations were pathetic.I want to know if the actors and all those involved really thought this was good stuff. Its not funny, its not sexy, its not exciting. Its a mess."
0,Michael Moore I just saw this and then Fahrenhype which shows how so much in this movie is positively untrue. The bin Ladens did not leave when the planes were grounded and they left on their own with no help from the government. Several people who seemed to be interviewed by Michael Moore were interviewed by someone else and had no idea the footage was being used for this movie. They were extremely indignant to think they could be put in a movie without their knowledge. All those who think this is great should watch Fahrenhype and then form an opinion.
0,"A pity  star is the minimum Another flop for the BBC. Never read the book, but shudder to think a screen play could have been this bad from a good book? There is NO plot. There is NO storyline. Its pretty much about a neurotic, chain smoking, wounded war veteran in a sanatorium. The characters are shallow and do nothing to keep you interested. The strange camera angles, which add a lot to film noir, and although sometime eerie, do nothing but contribute to the short comings of this film.What I disliked about this film  The actorsacting, the plotstoryline, the music, the lighting, THE MOVIEWhat I liked about this film  ABSOLUTELY NOTHING"
0,"Leaky!!! My wife bought me an Alterra for Christmas last year. For the most part I was happy with it. I had a few problems with the stop watch not working correctly, no big deal.

0,do not buy This looks like an airtex pump even has airtex on the plastic body. but that is all the pump arrived in a plain box not the factory box with foam packing. The pump lasted  days and had to buy full price after that thats how I know the diffrent package there was no O ring or plug in the box the factory box contaned all the parts do not get this pump unknowen where this pump came from. did not contact sell on this one not worth time or hassle. Cheap part and lesson learned

0,"Stargirl I read Stargirl for a book club in school. At first, i though the book would be preety good, after reading what it was about. But, after getting about  through the book, it got very boring and dull. The book just isnt very intresting and to me, has a terrible ending that leaves you a bit wondering. If you are thinking about reading this book, i would consider not reading it."
0,"Nice hat, but doesnt adjust to head size This is a nice hat, well constructed and very good quality. But the hat is fitted to a very large size. It has a buckle on the back but there is no gap for the band to shorten. When you shorten the band it bunches up the back of the hat and it folds over on itself. It looks like the designer, took a fitted hat and added a strap to it. It doesnt work and I had to return it."
0,"Dissappointing guitar For those of you still thinking of buying this for a cheap guitar to use with newer guitar hero games I urge you to think twice. The quality of this guitar is so frighteningly poor that Im literally throwing it away today and ordering a GH guitar. It just does not work properly. It frequently misses notes and today just wont maintain a connection. Do a google search and you will find that this bundle is infamous for faulty guitars. Spend the extra money for a GH bundle, it is worth it."
0,"Not like the original series This DVD is missing a lot of the nice features that the original series had, like the option of switching between the types of music or programming a workout. This DVD is also missing the warmup excercise. The way the DVD was created, they go through the moves very quickly. Also, the final dance is more for a man to watch then for a woman to learn. Many of the camera shots are head shots and not of the whole body. You can not see the moves they are executing. Oh, if you didnt know, its definitely not the same choregrapher from the PussyCat Dolls. The steps seem harder but the dance is longer."
0,"Yuppies can write! There is a certain type of writing, most often seen in magazines, that seems to admire itself as it goes along. In this book, from the beginning with the baby being born, through the characters who just dont seem to be appealing...it is a kind of yuppie literature...that you read and you ask yourself, Why do I not like this?I am sure Kafka is a good writer. But I found myself disliking this book more and more. It was like meeting a person at a cocktail party who at first seems interesting....but as the evening goes on, you gradually learn this person is not only shallow, but incredibly egomaniacal.I really ended up having a strong dislike towards this book. But I gave it  stars to be a good sport."
0,Braun MX Bad gears Bought this product Braun MX  in Jan  and we are about replace the blade gear for the second time. We use it once a week to blend Icecream and frozen fruit. It does not seem to handle frozen items very well. We have contacted Braun to see if theyll send us a new Blade gear. It is costing us now more for the replacement parts than the Blender originally cost us.
0,"Not buying it again It makes good coffee  thermos is useful, but there are a few things I didnt like The lid of the carafe is awkward to close sometimes. I spill coffee more compared to other carafes Ive owned. Once in a while, I dont push the filter box all the way, causing coffee to overflow  I know this is my user error, but it happens more often than usual with this machine. Carafe handle broke after . years of use. It looks like the issue was loose screw  a piece of degraded metal that connects the carafe and handle. I was disappointed how cheaply it is made, for the price Ive paid.Im looking for something a little higher quality for my next coffee maker  I might have to pay more but if it can last more than . years its worth it."
0,"Disappointed I was initially impressed with the sound quality, but after a couple of days, it started making static noises. It would do it almost constantly when my ipod was in it, but it would also occasionally make the noises even without the ipod. Sometimes it would be a constant static noise, and others it would be occasional, but that occasional static noise was very loud. I had the correct adapter in it, so I know that wasnt the issue. A few weeks later, it would every now and then not play my music. I could hear it through my ipod, but not through the speakers. Now, a couple of months after my purchase, all it will do is charge my ipod. I cannot get any sound except for the static to come out of it at all."
0,"Ludicrous Price Its pretty obvious that this is a required text for a course at a University somewhere, for thats the only thing that could conceivably justify a  price on an ebook.

0,"Warwicks efforts in the field of AI are laughable First came across Kevin Warwick with his In the Mind of the Machine some years back. It is cringingly badly written, full of egotistical selfreference, and mainly downright silly. Apparently Warwicks new machines will take control of their human masters and turn them into toiling slaves condemned to long hours of manual labour. This thesis is obviously absurd  what is the point in expending resources on a species that is hopelessly inept at an activity in which machines excel ?Warwicks obsession with stunts like embedding a chip in his arm so that his every movement can be tracked begs the question  would I ever want to know where Kevin Warwick is at any moment in time?.Avoid"
0,"Not a great griddle I have had this griddle for about two years, purchased at Target. The other reviews mention the bad nonstick surface which was also true for me. I have always had to grease the griddle. The surface didnt last and has bubbled and chipped and I have been avoiding those areas when using the griddle. it is now rusting in those small spots. It was rarely put in the dishwasher and we are finally throwing it away... Though I did regularly use it for pancakes with success, that was all because it never really worked well enough for anything else. You have to let it heat up a very long time to ensure that it is heated more evenly. The button latch to hold down the tray did not break. If they could make a better cooking surface, I believe I would be really happy with the product."
0,Poor construction This was very dissappointing. Pieces were damaged coming out of the box. The first drawer broke as it was being assembled. Online distributers offer free shipping because it will cost you too much to return so you are stuck with it. Check dimensions! This is a minature version of a desk. Very poor quality!
0,"Money better elsewhere I bought this as an addition to the kitchen aid mixer. I was really excited to make my first batch of ice cream after leaving the bowl in the freezer for two days. I put my ice cream mixture in and let it mix and mix... never getting to the consistency Id expect. Its good at making slushies, but not good thick and creamy ice cream. I felt that the bowl never stayed cold long enough.

0,"Not the best bet for Canadian parents I agree with what a previous reviewer said. This book is not the best option for Canadian parents. Pantley doesnt make any mention at all of the Canadian Paediatric Societys recommendations about infants and sleep, nor does she reference other Canadian health authorities like Health Canada. She also fails to mention the topnotch sleep disorders clinic at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto or to talk about the work of leading Canadian experts on babies and sleep. Most Canadian parents would find Bonny Reicherts book In Search of Sleep to be a lot more useful and relevant."
0,"A novel is no place for a shaggy dog story  pages that lead nowhere. The first  pages are not only written with some excellence, they lead the reader to be concerned about the story. The last  pages or so are little more than unintelligent garbage, hardly attached to the story at all. WORSE, the book ends with no conclusion leaving the reader, at least this one, angry enough to want to be the person who threatened the main character, except I want the author to suffer as he made me suffer writing a book without an ending. A novel is no place for a shaggy dog story."
0,Awful product plus really poor supprt This is an awful product. It crashes and reset often. I had it repaced by DLink and still no luck. To make matters worse DLink tech support are rude and clueless. I have  other friends with the same device and similar problems.

0,"Avoid this brand  magnets easily breakoff! I bought several of these taller defectors  for the oversized tall wall registers in my old home. Id bought some from Deflecto several years back that have worked well but slowly broke from the kidsthings banging into them. Unfortunately, Deflecto doesnt seem to make the tall version anymore so I bought these instead  BIG MISTAKE! These use a type of vinyl magnet like fridge magnet material that slides onto the edge of the deflector. Unfortunately these magnets tear and separate from the deflector  with seemingly the slightest bumping or movement. Of the  I installed  three were useless within a month. Ill just have to use the notastall but better made Deflecto models next time. Sure wish theyd make the tall ones again!"
0,"Outdated This dictionary is really outdated. The words were collected more than a century ago and not in a very reliable fashion.

0,"Half a Dozen Pages I think that Spiegelman could write a serious piece on the aftermath of  but this is not it. This scant group of strips were written more as catharsis than examination. As a record of how many felt at the time, its accurate. As an interesting story, its empty. If these pages were in a collected work or a biographical work they would be of more interest than as a stand alone group. Using classic strip characters from the early s is going to be emotionally distancing for some readers. While the art choice is Spiegelmans, the result is not always successful. Its hard to emotionally connect with a narrator holding you at such stylized length. Without the wide breadth of the city or even Spiegelmans experience the work comes off like a minor tract than a true statement. Niche market may love it but it wont appeal to many fans."
0,"Just another movie trashing the image of mexicanamericans. I saw this movie years ago only because my girlfriend at the time forced me to sit down and watch it along with her parents. All I could say is that I pray I never have to sit through this wannabee classic again. At a time in our lives when mexicanamericans are struggling to earn respect in this great nation,Edward James Olmos decides to come out with a movie that lets moviegoers of all races and colors see what mexican americans are supposedly like in everyday life. Lets see now....prison sex,babies drinking beer,teenage driveby shooters,earlyaged heroin users,brown on black killings,and so on!!!! Mr Olmos claimed he was only sending a message when making this film. Sadly,he just never said it wouldnt be positive. Let us not forget that several consultants to the film were murdered during its opening weeks by individuals who may have been offended by this movie. Mr Olmos himself was the target of threats as well. ADIOS AMIGOS!!!"
0,ZERO stars I purchased this in July and the CD player quit working in November. The unit is too large. There is no way for the sleep mode to run at a different volume than the alarm mode. The digital tuner is run by a wheel instead of a button so it is no more precise than an analog tuner. What a waste of money.....
0,"Despite the authors best intentions, HARMLESS. John Leonard is a leftwinger. Fine, so am I. The trouble is, he thinks that this is a daring and remarkable thing to be. Every few pages he lets us in on his leftism and more subtly, though subtlety has never been his thing how incredibly proud of himself he is for being leftist. You get the sense that he wishes there were some real and imminent peril in praising Toni Morrison, but there isntand he KNOWS itand therefore his toughboy declarations are not only repetitive but repulsive. Does he care about the lefts constituency, or does he just want to be seen caring in order to get chummy reviews from the Village Voice? Also, has anyone noticed that his prose is more often than not borderline incoherent?"
0,"Never buy this book, even if someone has a gun to your head This has to be the worst book i have ever used. Besides the numerous mistakes and typos each subject is covered so breifly that u might as well guess as to what to do. The books title is very misleading also.

0,"Like a Ton of Bricks After , Fellini came apart as an artist. And how have the mighty fallen! Nowhere in film is there a comparable example of an artist at the absolute height of his powers suddenly falling so short of everyones expectations. Juliet of the Spirits happens to be not merely an artistic failure  it reveals a moral failure in Fellini. Hereafter, his films would become inexcusably more and more selfindulgent. The filmmaker who made The White Sheik and Nights of Cabiria left us so suddenly. Fellini may as well have been run over by a lorry."
0,"What a load Wow this movie is crap Brett Moses must be the worst writer, actor, director since Ed Wood, this movie is horrid there are about a hundred unnecessary camera shots that serve only one purpose showing Brett Moses with yet another slow motion country dumb look on his face. Notice all the reviews are by other people that know this guy or where extras or attached to this movie, as a person with no connection to this steaming hot pile of a movie I would recommend not buying it, not even watching it swag online"

No se mucho de la informacion que contiene porque solo por verlo, deje de tener interes."

0,"Letters to Timothy or How to Run a Church Like a Business As a lifelong Baptist I always believed Baptist pastors and Baptist Churches were different from business and social leaders and their organizations, but this book shows me IT AINT SO!I have read business leadership manuals that werent as businessy as this handbook for pastors. Critics of organized religion will find much support in the book.It is probably a must read for young Baptist pastors, but I couldnt recommend it for the laity, unless you enjoy being disillusioned."
0,"Should be obscure firearms assemblydisassembly I bought the book with the hope that it would tell me how to reassemble a Remington Model  pump action rifle. Unfortunately, the book didnt have the Model  although its got a Kintrek KBP, Mauser DSM, and other exotica. There IS a disassemblyassembly procedure for the Remington Model , but it is so obscure that it did absolutely no good, even though the models are very similar. One crucial picture shows the cartridge guide, but the picture is composed such that the reader has NO idea how the cartridge guide should be oriented.Allinall, a waste of money and time."
0,"dont bother First off, I agree with the other reviewer that the type was way too small. I was glad to read his comments regarding the difficulty of reading this tiny type, because I thought my eyes were going bad.This book did not grab my interest, at all. I kept reading, thinking, its got to get better, but it dragged on. I didnt think the characters were at all interesting and the unending background information about the main characters Glorialife was unnecessary and boring page fillers at best. It was not an exciting or believeable book and left me thinking who cares? Im not sure why I even finished it, just wanted to get it over with so I could start a more interesting one. Maybe the author inherited some other talent or trait from his parents, but it wasnt writting thrillers."
0,"Have only read one chapter. This book is part of a church wide study group of  women. I was too late to sign up for this session so will take the next opportunity in the first of .

0,"Tired of being lied to Looks like Ben Mezrich can join the ranks of James Frey, Dave Pelzer and Kathy OBeirne, who write fiction but call it nonfiction. After reading this book I decided to do some online research. Didnt take long to find this comment in Wikipedia In , Boston magazine and The Boston Globe investigated the accuracy of Mezrichs nonfiction, identifying occasions in his blackjack books where scenes were invented out of whole cloth. Very disappointing to discover another best seller that is so fabricated yet purports to be telling the truth."

0,"Foiled again! The manufacturers of electric shavers appear to be taking pages out of the playbook used by makers of printers, which are often priced cheaper than the print cartridges themselves. Once theyve got you as a customer, they figure the red ink will soon be the customers, not theirs. Purchasing another screen my rd or th in two years for a shaver that cost me only  more than the flimsy foil itself strikes me as exhorbitant if not exploitive. The least Braun could do is make the foil available as a separate item rather than bundling it with the cutter assembly. Id try a Norelco or Remington, but I think theyre all manufactured in China for the same U.S. company Gillette?. I may bloody my face for a few more days before throwing in the towelor trying a Panasonic."

Hes a total idiot who is incapable of any sort of rational thought... and this movie proves it.

0,"not a practical planner for Kindle If you want a well written background book for the Greek Islands and culture this book does a good job but as a format for planning your trip hotel, restaurants, etc. it is pretty useless. I tried retreiving information about the Peloponnese region and Crete a number of different ways in my Kindle and could come up with no hotel reviews except a couple of brilliantly expensive highly rated hotels  useless for those seeking a selection. I am hoping Rough Guides and Lonely Planet will have a more comprehensive listing. In paperback this guide might be more helpful but for Kindle it rates two stars."
0,"Realy, realy bad phone Do not get this phone. I got it for free and it was cool at first but after a few days I got dissapointed. Sometimes when I dialed a number and hit the talk button, I put the phone to my ear and waited. Then I looked at the screen and the useless thing had gone to the main menu. Also the volume is really bad. You have to push the speaker into your ear really hard to hear somone on the other end.WARNING DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!"
0,"poor quality This item had not yet been reviewed when I purchased it. I usually am wary of products that havent been assessed since I find the critiques so helpful. However, this looked like such a good deal for a  piece set that I purchased it anyway. Unfortunately, I should have followed my regular shopping strategy. I was extremely disappointed when the hampers arrived. They do not seem sturdy, and some of the wicker weaving was already coming undone. Because of the poor quality, I dont think they are worth the discounted price. I cant believe they would ever sell for what is being advertised as the original price."
0,Super Size Me Movie I was very disappointed in this movie. It was listed as a PG movie. My son was getting it for a class project. When we got it in the mail it was a PG. We watched it and I couldnt believe the bad language. It also talked about sex and drugs. I couldnt believe they put it on the internet as a PG. Even as PG it was very dissappointing.
0,"Poor quality We thought this would be a great bag for either mom or dad to carry around. It does fit a lot and the pockets are handy, but the fabric that holds the string in ripped after less than  uses! This was a big problem since the velcro closure doesnt really work either. It was from our registry, but the store wouldnt take it back without the receipt, so its now repaired but well see how long it will last. Im shopping for a different one but am doing my research this time."
0,"terible batteriesmust be a bad batch!!!

0,Twin Guard Gyps I ordered a pair of Twin Guard Draft stoppers.I think that they are overpriced but thats not the worst problem. Instead of sending me  units they sent . Instead of billing me . plus shipping I was billed over .I let my credit card company know and they removed the charge pending an investigation. What fun!
0,"Sounds good, comfortable, but sadly unreliable These are very comfortable to wear for long periods, and sound good. Battery life is very poor, however, and need to be charged every day unlike other wireless headphone Ive used that can last  to  days between charging. My biggest complaint is mechanically and electrically they are junk. A constant irritation is you can hardly turn the things off. Sometimes you have to press the off switch for more than a minute, and often it takes several attempts. I am gentle with them, but they physically broke after a few months  the swivel post that holds the ear pieces to the frame broke. I did a creative glue job and gave up the swivel feature, which bought me another couple of weeks. At that time they just died completely, and I never got an additional peep out of them. I paid a high price for these at another retailer, and am very annoyed."

0,"Get real Quite possibly, the stupidest movie ever made.wellwrittencould have fooled me.artfully shotI guess it had its moments, especially if you like a lot of very black shadows covering most of what you want to see, but the rest of it is no better than the standards of crappy s TV.finely editedI guess theres an art to cutting a real turkeyNot a campfest, not a comedy, just plain bad. Get some busty dolls and some dopey guys, throw them in a stew, show some teasers of the breasts, add a cheesy, dashedoff script by a guy who suddenly exemplars do as I say, not as I do and plan on it becoming a cult classic.

0,"Very disappointed After reading Christy, I was actually looking forward to this book. I want to reconnect with God and find spiritual balance that I lost after my mother died. While Mrs. Marshall was able to talk honestly about Germanys past, she could not do the same regarding America. Maybe if youre a middle to upper class white conservative christian you will find peace in this book. I cant overlook facts on my journey to Christ. Im seeking the truth but in this book have to brush over not only American history but my own experience as a minority, as seeking material gain."
0,"Tedious and dull Montgomery is nowhere at her best in this book which naver really goes anywhere. Marigold comes across as exceedingly insipid and by the middle of this book the reader is bored enough to shut it.The saving grace is the family discussion on what to name the baby,but even that seems stilted at times.Young and Old Grandmothers add some spark to the book but on the whole I almost wept at the thought that Anne came from the same pen as this dull heroine."
0,"Disappointing I tried to give this game  stars, but I just cant find it in me to do so. I expected this game to be so much more than it is. The graphics even considering the time period are blocky looking. Thanks to all the beautiful backgrounds, you often cannot tell where your character canshould walk. And the whole Aeris thing those of you who have played will understand leaves you feeling as though there should have been more to it that the game designers forgot to put in. I spent most of the game thinking she would be able to come back to life. Sad to say, it seems that Square sacrificed story line and plot to make this game. Given a choice, Id rather play Final Fantasy  or  for the SNES."
0,Not the original recording  beware This is a nice collection for Demis Roussos if you didnt listen to the original recording before and dont have memories with each song and how it exactly sounded with his dreamy voice over  years ago. His voice in this mostly rerecorded collection is a bit rusty and the music is poorly conducted compared to the original recording. I gave it two stars as it contains also some of his newer s nice songs in its original format such as Summer Wine.
0,"Poorly written and edited. I am not going to address the political correctness of the book or the authors motives. However, I am going to suggest to the author and publisher to invest in a guide to proofreading. In my opinion, the book was poorly written and obviously not edited. I could not fully grasp the storyline without proofing the book. For those readers looking for a quality written piece of literature, keep looking."
0,the most disappointing book of the series I have read several of the books in the making out series and this is the worst. In the past I was unable to put them down like with ben takes a chance but this is very slow. I am very sick of Ben being a jerkoff but worse I am sick of Nina being a push over. She should tell him to kiss off!! I think katherine applegate needs to find some new inspiration. I am hoping the next one is somewhat better!!
0,"A Star For Each Fully Realized Tune There are only two of them on this album  Number of the Beast and Run to the Hills. I was going to impose an additional star penalty for the pain caused by missed opportunities, lack of rehearsal time, and just plain lazy sloppiness  but Im generous. The difference between the filler and the good tunes is so distinct that a serious listener would swear its two different bands. One that has learned to play a solid fully developed tune  together in tempo  and one that cant keep simple  rock timing. I was actually quite surprised at the disparity in quality on this album as well as the lost potental of several poorly executed tracks and others that are just plain filler. I recommend downloading single tracks when it comes to Iron Maiden  some of their tracks are outright classics."
0,"Bad Entertainment I saw a part of this movie when it was shown on TV and I was very disappointed. As far as biblical history goes, it was an insult. Even when I looked past the inacuracies, it was plain silly and childish. Dont waste your money. I would rate this a zero if I could. If you want a more entertaining and accurate look at the biblical Genesis, I recommend the movie The Bible."
0,"Excruciatingly Poor I have rarely starting reading a novel that I have not been able to finish. I could only torture myself into the third chapter of this tedious, incongruous, boring book. Also, the editing and typesetting are horrid. I kept thinking, Someone got paid to do this??? Sadly, I found myself scoffing and rolling my eyes while reading what I suppose the author meant to be serious prose. I picked up Walk East on Burnside because I live in Portland and thought it would be fun to read something set in familiar environs. I could get more enjoyment from riding around on a TriMet bus reading the street signs. At least I would know where I was going. Dont waste your money on this one. Dr. Turco, you need to stick with psychos and criminals. Please dont attempt any more fiction. It is too painful."
0,"Elementary my dear Watson The author exhibits elementary lapses in logic. On the one hand he contends that Americans feel like victims, and arent victims. On the other, he contends that this attitude victimizes Americans. He does not explain why America, which he obviously believes to be the greatest country on earth, is uniquely prone to victim mentality. Why not Bolivia or India?This book is a typical example of conservatives badmouthing America while pretending to be great patriots."
0,"Completely Sad to Watch This movie really was quite sad for me to watch, because I disliked it very much. There is hardly any magic and charm from the original book. It was just absolutely corny, and the book isnt that way. Although it didnt have to go by the book, the movie itself was pretty horrible. I was embarrassed the whole time while watching it, and then when it was about to end, where everyone starts singing Kareoke, I was gone. It just wasnt worth our money and time. Too bad it wasnt that great, because the book is definitely magic."
0,"OH GOD HAVE MERCY I really cant believe that I wasted my money on this book. It was godawful. From the cover to page what seemed like , I was bored beyond belief. I really hope Grisham doesnt write any more books like this pile of Pat Wong. Seriously guys, dont waste your money."
0,"Sappy Stuff Poorly Written Although Carol Ortlip has a tender story to tell, its written in the most hackneyed, superficial and selfcentered way. There were no universal realizations here. Despite her experience, its just not deep enough to be a satisfying read. I couldnt get past the first  pages."
0,Not at the root of the problem This book avoids the real issue.....again. Why do we keep avoiding this strange reality that reflects the abundance of Black churches coupled with the abundance of Black problems? If we REALLY want to go forward as Black people then read Jeremiah Camaras outstanding book Holy Lockdown Does the Church Limit Black Progress? Jeremiah Camara lays out the problem unapologetically and offers practical solutions. Holy Lockdown is a masterpiece that absolutely no Black home should be without.
0,"How can you mess up something so simple??? They sent me a SD card for a Digital Camera, instead of the one I needed for my cell phone. Youd think a place that sells this stuff on a regular basis would have noticed the big diffrence between the two items. The one is X bigger than the cell phone SD card. Waste of , and a headache Ill never deal with again. FAIL!"
0,"craptastic The first of  post pink floyd albums. Of all of them, this has to be the crappiest. I guess since he knew it wouldnt sell well because he couldnt put Pink Floyd on the cover, he put a half naked chick on the cover. Nice. Roger must have had something on Eric Clapton to make him play on this album. Even with him on this album, it still sucked. I have to say his other albums were at least decent this is just not worth listening to."
0,"Suncast Outdoor Trash can While the product went together quickly and just like the instructions said, the lid leaves alot to be desired. The mechanism designed to slideopen and lock does not stay attached to the can and instead ends up in your hand.Because there is nowhere to hook or secure a trash bag inside I have decided to make it my recylcle can instead.I would not buy this item again nor would I reccommend it if you are planning on placing regular trash in it."
0,"Defective design I encountered  problems installing the kit. The first is that the  Hose Swivel Connector leaks between the threaded connector and the compression adapter. The second is that the  Hose to Pipe Thread AntiSiphon Connector does not properly compress the water hoses threaded connector to the hose adapter. This causes a leak between the hose connector and adapter. I have the highest quality hose, and it does not leak when connected to an ordinary faucet. The kit is unusable."
0,"Politics at the Lowest Poor Michael Moore, here he goes to all the trouble to make a film to target George Bush and the man gets reelected anyway.Ive no love for Mr. Bush, but Moores editing and rearranging of film to suit his agenda is wrong when he presents it as a documentary. This man has less regard for the truth than Bush does that is saying something.Was the war with Iraq illplanned, probably so. However, Hussein baited us by deliberately withholding materials and not allowing UN inspectors to do what he promised they would be allowed to do. Reasonable minds would have to conclude he was hiding something.Maybe he was. We have no idea what got moved where before the US attack.What we do know is that if you want truth, dont look to Moore."
0,"Looks pretty no substance Youve seen this movie before. It looks pretty but the story is kind of dumb unless youre into religious idolatry and talking wolves. If you like this twilight teenage stuff youll probably like this movie, if you have at least moderate movie taste probably not. Its not like hollywood will actually dig up a new story to slap on the screen so it has to be based on something like a fairy tale, old movie, history, etc, because people dont want to watch something new and fresh unless it involves creepy looking garbage eating aliens."
0,"Ugh! I can enjoy an entertaining, unrealistic book or movie from time to time but, this book was unbelievable and ridiculous beyond compare! I spent much of my time saying to myself, Yeah right. or Gimme a break! ...or rolling my eyes at all the one liners and cliches. The authors tried way too hard to be witty. If they removed half of the humor and replaced it with substance, like real character development this might have been a worthwhile read."

0,"Master thesis, not a novel. I bought this book under the assumption that it would delve into the hazing aspect of BGLOs at a...normal...view point. I bought this book for an extension of my studies of BGLOSs, hazing, and hazings origins. Id seen this book a few years ago, and researched it before I actually bought it, and before I bought it, I read a sample. Once I bought the book, I felt SO let down!This book is a huge jumble of overly large words, assumptions, and guesses Ive found more profound knowledge on Youtube regarding BGLOs. This book reads like a master thesis with no entertainment value or real substance. This book does have its plusses though I cant think of any at the moment, but it does not live up to the hype. I would recommend reading Divine Nine, Captain of my Soul, and Rev. Hatchetts book coming apart at the seams."

0,"Exasperating experience I have never returned a book for a refund. Until now. And thats a shame, because David Long is a master of the English language. Technically, his writing is brilliant  and thats what the two stars are for. The problem with Daughters is that we are led down a meandering road full of broken promises. I wont recount the story, as thats been done. Suffice to say, after an intriguing prologue and even more mysterious and fascinating opening chapter, this book devolves into a series of endless, exasperating phone and email monologues. At one stretch, a single email drags on for  consecutive pages and offers nothing to advance the story but plenty of frustrate the reader. Any socalled resolution to the mystery is an outofleftfield theory involving a tiny character who emerges through another tiny characters recollections in the last fifty pages. The middle third of this book could have been dropped. This is a novella at most and a short story at best."

However, I was also unable to find where I could select that option. I wouldve purchased it if I could find it anywhere on the sellers page. Even still.So I now have this really pretty candle holder that doesnt stand on its own, lying in a box until I find something to display it with elsewhere. But I will say the star itself is quite lovely, especially the color."

0,"Defective While the system was easy to set up, unfortunately, the DVD player did not function perfectly. On several DVDs I tried, problems like the inability to select certain chapters of a movie, or the picture freezing up, occurred.

Also, the buttons for DVD functions on the remote are really tiny and the user manual did not explain things as well as it should have."
0,"Not well versed in matters Calhounian. Prof. Nivens book fails on a number of counts, but mainly on that of familiarity with the sources of Calhouns political thought. For example, in describing Calhouns indebtedness to the Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions of , Niven says that neither document contemplated action by an individual state. To correct this impression, one need only consult Jeffersons draft of the Kentucky Resolutions how anyone who had even read this fivepage document could see it as anything other than a threat to interfere with enforcement of the Alien and Sedition Acts within the boundaries of Kentucky is beyond me. The book is full of similiar evidence of Nivens failure to acquaint himself with even the most basic sources. Try Bartletts Calhoun biography, instead."

0,"What a cheap piece of garbage If I did not pay so much for my cordless radar detector I would have thrown it out a long time ago. What a pain to have to keep buying these cups that only last for a short time. They need to come up with a better way of mounting the detectors so you do not need to keep coming back for this accessory, or maybe that is what they want."
0,"Disappointed When I received this wallet navy blue, it had a blemish in the leather, NOT the type that would naturally occur in the grain. It looked like a scorch mark as if the wallet had been laid against something hot. When I ordered this item there was a notation that it was the last in stock, now on this site navy blue is still offered with no notation of it being out of stock. I suspect it was a reject that someone wanted to get rid of. Not worth the time or money sending it back, however I will never order again when an item is listed as last in stock, and would be skeptical ordering from this seller again.Also, the leather on this item is less than paper thin. The only redeeming value of this wallet is the design."

0,"For the love of Oprah, do not read! This book epitomizes undeserved recognition for something that is for shock factor. I had to read this in college in a Modern novel course, and out of all the great reads, this was by far the worst! Story was way too long and did nothing for me and the movie was even worse  do not want to see Oprah naked...ever!. Its amazing to me how much people talk about this book or Song of Solomon which i had to read an hated bc there is nothing valuable in here. Go read something good like The Great Gatsby, To Kill A Mockingbird, Sister Carrie, anything else, please!!!"
0,"Great Idea But it Doesnt Work I give up. Every morning I come down and find the power strip in the wrong mode. I pull it out to see whats going on, and find the clock set to some random time, and all the programs gone. I reset it all. I walk by at night on the way to bed, and its in the wrong condition again. I pull it out, and, again, its set to completely random settings again. For right now Im just using it by manually changing the mode. The random time display is quite interesting, though.Good idea, poor execution."
0,"ZZzzzzzzzzzz Wow, where do I begin on this one. Although this novel is supposed to be considered a classic for its time, I found the book to be horribly drawn out and boring. If you want a book that takes you on a journey into the mind of a serial killer, then skip this book! If you want a book that gives you an inside look into a tedious, boring, slow moving, and drawn out investigation, then this book could be for you. For most readers of the thrillerdetective genre, I would recommend to skip this one. I by now means am trying to say that Sanders is a poor writer. Im just saying that his imagination could use a little work. The ending is completely lame too. Horrible!"
0,"Galileo x Compact Zoom Binocular I was attracted to these by the zoom range, the mm objective lens and the relatively small size of the binoculars. They do have a clear bright image at the x range. The focus ring on the right eyepiece is a little tight so it was difficult to know if you were changing the focus or if the rubber cover was just slipping.The major problem is when you focus at x and then zoom to x you have to refocus both sides. I tried it by focusing at x and then going back to x and now x was out of focus. This was unacceptable, so I returned them. The last thing I want is to have to refocus every time I zoom."
0,"Misleading title! This is not the Absolute Best of Bing Crosby. No way! I have been following Bings career since I was  years old and own nearly every song he ever sang and I have never heard of Dardenella, which is inexplicably included on this collection.There is simply no way to condense Bing Crosbys prodigious musical catalgue into  songs and many of these songs were never issued as singles, much less regarded as a hit. Its totally insulting to include a nonentity as Bye Bye Blues on a Crosby collection os supposed hits. Bings great songs from his golden era of the s and early s comprise  great songs in one month.The songs selections here cater strictly to Bing of the s and s, when Bings voice was not as compelling a musical instrument as it had been in the s. Avoid this sorry collection, if youre seriously interested in understanding and appreciating Bing Crosby, please consider buying the better disc collection offered on Amazon."
0,"Paging Captian Obvious! I find it extremely humorous that all of the  star reviewers for this book are quick to point out Micheal Moore lying and exaggerating to get his way. But ask yourselves this, does any of that change the fact that G.W. Bush is a liar and a murderer? Does David T. Hardy and company have any evidence whatsoever to dismiss the FACTS in Fahrenheit ? Forget Roger  Me, forget Bowling For Columbine. What about the FACTS? The Bush family and everyone under G.W. are getting rich off of a meaningless war? Was Saddam Hussein really a threat with his WMDs? Is it just a coincidence that the one state the  election came down to was a state whos governor happened to be G.W.s brother? Does any of Michael Moores lies have anything to do with that? All of you  star reviewers COMPLETELY ignore all of these things. Things most people wouldnt know if it wasnt for Michael Moore. Of course, its easy to dismiss all of these FACTS if youre a blind Bush supporter."
0,"pure horrible CRAP! im warning anyone who wants to check this garbage out dont buy, first off the story doesnt follow the game actually there is no plot, the acting is horrific, the actors look nothing like the video game characters, the action does not help the movie horribly cheographed. All in out the whole movie suck so bad that i couldnt stomach it enough to finish it, its like watching a Uwe Boll movie. if you want to check it out then rent itdoesnt deserve a rental."
0,Disappointed in Can Opener I like the style and color black of the can opener. I like that it will open tall cans. It operates quickly once you are able to get it to pick up the can.I did not like how it shreds the paper on the outside of the can. It leaves a mess on the counter and sometimes the shredded paper gets in the can or stuck in the can openers gear.I would not recommend it.
0,"Inedible I have tried almost all of the La Briut products and while certain ones are edible and some even tasty considering what they are, this particular flavor is disgusting. I tried it twice thinking I may have received a dud the first time but I wasnt wrong.I took one bite and spit it out. This meal is not fit for human consumption. It doesnt even taste like food. Please be forewarned."
0,"Boooh Bought this movie only because I like very much Paul McGillion from Stargate Atlatnis and Shannen Doherty Beverly Hills , Charmed. Both are cool actors but honestely, this movie is terrible and cheap filmed. The movie plays somewhen in the past but they have microphonesspeakers? Anyway... its a fantasy movie and dont care about.But this movie is really cheapy filmed its look like an amateur movie. The special Effects are for a small TV Channel good. Stars for hottie Paul McGillion Stars for Shannen DohertyZero Stars for the movie Stars for the DVD quality Picture quality is good and contains also English subtitles!FaZIT only for fans of those actors."
0,dislike It looked like aluminum foil up against my engagement ring. I am not satisfied as I wanted it to be a temporary wedding band till i get a real one. But I can say by its self its cute. It could look real on a finger by itself.
0,"Less than two years old . . . dead. I purchased this gauge around two years ago for my girl friend. It has only been used a couple of times. When I tried to use it a couple of days ago, it was dead. New batteries wouldnt bring it back to life. Plus the rubberized handle has become sticky sitting in her glove box in the Texas heat over the past two years. Dont buy."
0,"WARNING ONLY EUROPE V AVAILABLE ON THIS UNIT I should have read the other one star review before buying. Received this with a bulky, heavy transformer included. Wondered what the heck? Opened unit it is designed for Europe with V access only, hence the bulky transformer. Unacceptable! No where on the product listing does it state this. Would have given zero stars if I could have. To Amazons credit, it is immediately accepted for return."
0,"The Catholic Mystery  Not Quite Revealed! John Armstrong starts out his book in the very beginning by saying that he doesnt think that there will ever be unity between Catholics and Protestants, no matter what efforts they can be superficially united in. He attempts to explain the Catholic Mystery using many quotes and comments, unfortunately, the reader once again ends up with a lot of misinformation about the Catholic Church!Armstrong may have tried his best, but he falls very short. If you truly want to learn about the Catholic Church you are going to have to use Catholic sources, such as the Catechism of the Catholic Church and other books, especially your Bible. Listen to some tapes by Catholic apologists and compare their arguments with Armstrongs arguments! Break open that Bible and read it all! Then you decide! The Catholic Mystery is still unfolding, yet Armstrong sheds little light on it."
0,"I guess people like Larry Colton got to make a living Mr. Colton  dont assume all native americans are alcoholics  dont assume were all on welfare or get federal assistance  dont assume we all live in dirty neighborhoods  dont assume we all play basketballSome of us have gone out in this world an proved that we can be successful in government,medical or whatever career we chose. My advice to Mr. Colton is not to judge the rest of us by one individual storyline. Rez life is what you make of it! it can be a good or bad place, just like any orther place."
0,"Romance Novel The following clip sums this book upHed spent the day juggling half a dozen problems here and abroad, but that small oval cutout in my shirtwaist kept distracting him. That cutout, he said, was his window on the world.There were some nice moments in this book, but too much heaving bodice for me. If you like historical romance, youll probably really enjoy this book. It is a cut above in that respect.If you want depth, it will annoy you. Historical facts are not seamlessly woven into the narrative, and stand out as if cut and pasted. Feldman tries, has brief success, but ultimately fails to bring the peices of FDR, Eleanor, and Lucy to a full bodied life."
0,"The Heroine as Pitiful Monster Though she thinks shes writing a romance novel, Cohen has actually produced a grotesquely comic portrait of all that is most loathsome in contemporary American culture. Shes selfrighteous about all the wrong things smoking, drinking, drugs and sex. But she has no shame at all about letting her tabloid news producer use her to hound any liberal targets he wants destroyed. In fact, she uses a rumor about Clinton administration officials visiting Moscow prostitutes to get him to finance her childish, silly pilgrimage to Russia to entrap a man shes never so much as kissed. When their fanciful romance fails, she returns to a job with Fox Networks, convinced of her own rectitude. At last she has escaped evil Russia, where people drink, smoke and exchange sex for money. Shes back home in Trumpland, where true morality reigns."
0,"Silly Besides being awkward and poorly acted out, the strangest thing about ths video is that they the creationsists actually had Darwin making good points, and he clearly won the debate, being the only one who made any valid comments at all. Calvin simply repeated that the bible is the true word, end of story. Darwin pointed out the idiocy and still the audience sided with him. Even in their own video, Darwin clearly kicked their asses but they cant see it."
0,Good but not what I wanted This book is good for one looking for landscape ideas and techniques. I want a Southwest plant identification book. It does that poorly with photos difficult to see closely.
0,"Too Sensual, Too Immodest If you like to see an hour of up close videography of womens lips, teeth and toungues, then this video is for you. If you are not bothered by your husband watching pretty women sing with their chests hanging out, then you will enjoy this. I did not enjoy it, and found it offensive. I did not appreciate their dresses with breasts hanging out, or low cut dresses. The violinist does not wear a slip so at times, if she is in the right light you can seethrough her dress. Very immodest and offensive. They have such sweet voices, but all that sweetness is turned to trash by the what they wore. I did not appreciate my husband receiving this as a gift. Why put a stumbling block in front of a man?"
0,"New spin on the age old tale turns it into a crime drama with bad animation, ugly characters This was a bad animated movie on a lot of different levels. Great voice acting though! The story was a crime drama with  of the classic characters being interrogated about a recipe thief by a frog inspector. Animation was stiff, the characters were ugly, textures were very ugly and pretty basic. Without spoiling it, they do take the characters and twist them like the Woodsman isnt really a Woodsman, the Wolf is a misunderstood good guy and the granny is acting like a teenager. Theres a joke a second. Its kind of like Family guy where they just come up with random stuff and throw it at a wall to see what sticks. There are a lot of chuckles. When it focused on the plot, it seemed very predictable. If anything, this movie is for kids, but it seems like teens would like it with all of its innuendos."
0,"A fire hazard, Beware! Beware!!! When buying this product. We have went through  of these in the last year. If left on for a period of time like an hour, it starts to slowlyover a period of a few months melt the outer plastic until its burnt and black becoming a fire hazard before you know it. The outer side becomes as hot as the inner straightener heating up the desk or carpet that it is sat on. I find myself making sure it is off before I leave the house. We even thought that buying two at a time would solve this problem but it just delayed it. Why would I have bought four you ask...well we thought the first was defective so we bought the second one that fell apart after about three months so I bought the third and forth. My daughters love this product for straightening their hair.It is an inexpensive way of getting a professional look. It is not worth the safty of my home and family to get this, trying another product this time."
0,"Doesnt get the job done Heres my experience with Norton It would detect viruses and spyware, but was unable to quarantine or remove them. That made their product useless to me. Later, I downloaded free virus  spyware protection from a different provider over the net. That product not only detected threats, but was also able to zap them. Skip Norton."
0,"Very disappointed! Lets just say this book is not what I expected it would be after reading the Alchemist,which was great!Like other people said it before me it is boring and towards the end it gets so confusing ,it seems as if even the author himself forgot where he was going with the storyline.I honestly tried to focus on what I was reading but its hard when it seems like the same words just keep repeating and the author cant get to the message of the story.I was very disappointed!"
0,"Boring This book was highly recommended to me and I see that most of the other reviews are very good but I dont get it. I found the book incredibly uninteresting and dull to read. My sister read it at the same time and had the same opinion.I was expecting the book to have a lot of clever tieins and twists relating back to the L. Frank Baum novels. Instead, I found a story that barely had anything to do with the original works, either in tone or substance. The new story just didnt interest me at all. Maybe I missed something but I could barely get through the book so couldnt recommend it to others."
0,I returned them. I have several pairs of wireless head phones. This pair was not good. I tried them one time and then put them back in the box. I have two pairs of the Sennheiser RS . The reception is much better. The static on the Sony was so bad that it hurt to wear them. I would go with a good pair of Sennheiser headphones.
0,"Disappointing video quality While the races are covered fairly well and there are a few bonus features, the video quality is very disappointing. Another viewer noted the same trouble I experienced and called it panning artifacts. Namely, when the camera follows the cars moving quickly, there is a pronounced blurringstuttering effect. It is very distracting and takes away from the race and commentary. I actually stopped watching about five races in because of it. Why cant these guys get it right? Be warned  this DVD is for you only if you are a hardcore fan and MUST have each years review. Otherwise, those looking for a neat and effective wrapup of last season will come away disappointed."
0,"Original artists remakes These are songs done by the original artists in studio long after the original songs were released. It would have been nice if someone had said up front that these were remakes and not the originals. Some of the singers are still able to duplicate their original performance, like Gene Chandlers Duke of Earl. Others, like Skeeter Davis The End of the World is embarrassing to listen to, her voice is gone. If you like oldies, save your money on this one and buy the original hits."
0,"So bad. Its the worst I had expected K BC to be on the order of Gladiator or another epic movie  even Quest for Fire.However, after popping in the disc and watching the first  minutes, I knew I was in for a horrifying waste of film and time. Boring dialog, horrible intros, you name it  it had it.I ended up fast forwarding through the entire movie. Skip, listen, skip and listen again. All in all, this film isnt worth the  minutes it takes to skip through all of it.Save your .  this film sucks and should be forgotten."
0,"Someone Get That Penciller a Nude Model! Mediocre story continues the long tradition of Wildstorm and Image artists who have clearly never seen a naked lady before. This comic has some of the most ludicrous anatomy I have ever seen, as though Rob Liefeld and Marc Silvestri taught a class in figure drawing and gave As to anyone who showed up. Terrible."
0,"Scary Gift This book was awful. I gave it as a gift for Mothers Day and have since regretted it. My Mom thought that I was trying to send her a message that I needed help desperately and even tried to make us go to counseling together. Fortunately, I was able to convince my Mom that I hadnt read the book but ordered it in a frenzy right before Mothers Day. She says that it was such a bad book that she couldnt stomach to finish it. I then read some of it and realized why my Mom was so upset. This does not show a nice MotherDaughter relationship but instead one that should not be there at all. Biological ties does not make a relationship between both people a must."
0,"Doesnt really do anything I purchased this product for my husband for Christmas. He has been in two car accidents and has migraines. We thought this might help. It doesnt. He feels very uncomfortable in fact. My mom has arthritis of the spine and she could not use it either. In fact, if you are short, as my mother and myself are, it doesnt do anything for you."
0,"MISSING IN ACTION LOST PROPHETS This album is quite possibly the worst album I have ever heard and I have heard some bad ones let me tell you! Well the prophets got something right there totally....lost!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This album is just another example of not being true to yourself or your band. Jumping on what sells and neglecting the fans that made you so popular is just wrong. There was a time when it actually was cool to listen to lost prophets, unfortunately now is not one of them! I dont forsee this changing with these sellouts anytime soon! If you have a quarter, good, because that is about all this album is worth and thats stretching it!"

Lets try just one new release of unheard material or maybe its about time to get S.O.S. off of the shelf, clean it up, and get it out there so those who havent heard it get a chance to see what Chicago can do when they want to work it.Time to stop treating us to more repackages."
0,"why this one? I am a HUGE Doctor Who, and unlike many people, I enjoyed Sylvester McCoys episodes quite a lot. I was thrilled to hear more episodes were being released on DVD, but bewildered as to the choices made.. Surely, Robots of Death and Caves of Androzani are classics, but this episode was pure junk. Boring and tired, this truly signaled the end of a phenomenon. I think I would have rather seen every other McCoy epidsode on DVD but this one.I will say one good thing the extras are much better than on the Caves DVD, and the extras are far more interesting than the actual episode itself."
0,"Maybe VB but not VBA For the basics of programming in VB this may well be a good book but if youre an experienced programmer and want to dive in at the deep end and program in VBA for Excel, Word etc then this book wont help you much. Better to buy Walkenbach, Green or Kofler. For a terse, precise clarification of language syntax it gets top marks."
0,Lotsa filler I was very excited at first when i purchased this book. I was dissapointed when I started reading it. I wanted to know how to grow pot. I found it to be very thin when it came to explaining things. Way too much information in some chapters. I did however get some info from it and have a nice  footer growing in my closet. I used a ratio of   my own compost to a good potting soil something this book reccomends against. Its obvious some of the other reviewers did not read this book.
0,Dissatisfied Customer The Ninja Turtle Lair is not durable. This toy constantly falls apart. My  year old son gets frustrated with this toy and will not play with it. We are very dissatisfied with our purchase.
0,"The Village meets mm It seems Nicolas Cage is in a movie every other month nowadays, so they cant all be good. This movie falls squarely and flatly in the not good category. Having not seen the original, all I can say is that throughout this flick it seemed much longer than it was, I had the underlying, horrific feeling that it was supposed to be deeper than it was  that it hasd some message that I was somehow missing. Now having read the reviews of this version and the original s version, I understand why this movie had the ending it had. But otherwise, the ending definitely leaves you with a what the hell was the point of all that? feeling that is never a sign of a good movie. It fact, it is usually the sign of a bad one."
0,"My least favorite of the series........ I wanted to finish the series, so I forced myself to finish this one. The good news is there is a twist at the end. The bad news is, its pretty slow before that. Im guessing Philippa was trying to cover the whole era, and this part is a yawner. There is really only  main characters, with three minor characters. Without all the twist and turns of her other books with a large cast of characters, there isnt much intrigue here. In Philippas other books, Ive become attached to at least one character, and cant wait to find out what happens to them. I didnt have any favorites here. I got lost in discussions about French, Scottish and English alliancesit turned into a history lesson. You could probably skip this one without losing your place in the series."
0,"Heating problem I have used this productWaring Pro DB Portable Double Burner for a short time. The first few times the small burner worked, now it does not heat properlydoes not heat up in a timely manner. It maybe a problem with the switch on the small unit.

0,"DRM is terrible The DRM on this game is terrible. You can only install it three times, after which you have to call EA and beg them to be nice enough to let you install the game you paid for again. I have a separate copy of Windows that I use just for gaming, and I erase it several times a year to keep it clean and virusmalware free. So Ill get to play my  game for  months or so before I am forced to BEG for the PRIVILEGE of playing it some more."
0,"Bad Firewire Ports I owned one of these without issue for about  months and decided to buy another same size, same model to double my external capacity.The new drives firewire ports both of them didnt work. When I exchanged it for a new one, same thing  both firewire ports defective. You cant chalk this up to user error because I own an identical drive and troubleshooted everything on both drives crosstesting them on different computers, tested the cables, power supplies, etc. etc. and no dice  its the ports.One faulty drive Id chalk up to bad luck, but twice in a row is no coincidence. Im getting rid of these drives BOTH of them because I dont want to trust my precious data to hardware thats habitually bad. I suggest looking at a different company. This isnt the first time Ive had issues with a Western Digitial drive."
0,"Bad Bad, too Bad! I was shocked when I watched this version of Mansfield Park. The insertion of a subject not addressed in the book or by the author anywhere at all is disgraceful and also pushed the limits in graphic detail. I wouldnt let my grandchildren watch this version and I have told many of my friends not to watch or buy it. Not worthy of even  star."
0,"Against the Tide I bought this CD last year because I heard his wonderful voice singing Song on the Sand in the tribute to Jerry Miller on TV. I cannot reconcile this CD with his voice on the Jerry Miller tribute. It is like listening to two different persons and the picture on the CD doesnt even look like the one on the abovementioned program. I played it twice and will never listen to it again. It is really bad. Anyone who reviewed this CD favorably must be tone deaf. I wasted my money on such an incredibly bad album. What a disappointment! If he recorded songs like he did on the TV program, I certainly would buy his albums. What a change in a person and his music. Very bad!"
0,"I like a good McCaffrey book. This aint good McCaffrey. This is another expanded short story from GET OFF THE UNICORN. This time, its The Thorns of Barevi, which Ms. McCaffrey called ...an attempt to cash in on the lucrative market for soft and hardcore pornography in the s. Need I say more? This expansion into a trilogy stretches a thin story past the breaking point. The unreal speed of technological development was especially irritating left on the planet with axes, knives, and blankets, less than two months later theyre rebuilding circuit boards to put a cell phone net up? Not likely! McCaffrey has never been a technologydriven author, but this is ridiculous! Her antimilitary prejudice shows throughout, and the social dynamics in the group can charitably be called unlikely who really thinks Aarens wouldnt have suffered a fatal accident shortly after being rescued? The remaining books in the trilogy go downhill from here. Overall, leave this series alone."
0,"Just no. This movie is kind of crap. There I said it, I watched this for Hardy and was not disappointed in its badness. Reminded me of Lawnmower Man, a very slightly superior film. Everyone I wanted to live dies and those I wanted to perish clung stubbornly to life. Their must be better films to waste your time with, pass on this, life is too short."

0,"Pass it up! I thought this would be a great can opener. Not so. It works with extra tall cans, and thats about it. Dont even think about trying to open small cans, such as a  oz. or so. It just will not work. This can opener does indeed shred labels and is most difficult to line up with the place where its supposed to lock on to the lid. Since I bought this can opener, it has taken me an average of about three attempts to open any given can.In short, Im taking this thing back. My manual can opener works better than this!"

0,Destroyed my Computer I installed this battery in my computer and less than a day later the computer started smelling burnt. I shut the computer down and it wouldnt turn back on again. I took it apart and saw that the motherboard had literally burned in a spot right between the battery jack and the power input. I seem to not be the only person that this has happened to. All I could do is get my money back and I had to buy a new computer motherboard is about  to replace. DO NOT BUY THIS!!
0,Worst design ever! I have been cleaning houses for  years and I have never spent more time clearing out a vacuum hose more than this one. The design is simply bad there is a  degree angle that the simplest things get caught in and the suction power even when there isnt something to reem out is pathetic. This is the worst purchase I have ever made I would feel bad giving this vacuum away it has caused me so much frustration and grief. Ugh!

0,dont waste your money I really regret buying this  wish I would have returned it. I am a student  I didnt learn anything but they had terrible taste in music when recording this. Awful. From all of the other reviews  thought this would be a staple. It is not. Youre welcome.
0,"Not what it is all cracked up to be Ok Ok ok...so yeh the reason i bought the cd was because it said on the case the best band ever  TBS...and I like TBS so i took there advice. Much to my mistake, so they are ok, they arent great or even good they are ok. At least the cd is, i dont know about live shows, thats how i tend to rate bands but this cd could have been alot better. The production is horrible they try to do too difficult of unision rhythms and they cant pull them off. Sometimes the drummer sounds like he just randomly drops his stick on the snare. The singer is nothing special, the guitarist is choppy. I mean there is nothing on this cd that is just flat out good, but then again its not live....so take it which ever way you want it but to me they should of spent a little more time in the studio"
0,"Author has nothing original to say about Mexico OR trains You might find it hard to believe that someone who cant speak Spanish would undertake a travel book about Mexico. However, this turns out not to be an authentic travel book, but simply a rehashing of Mexican history obviously taken secondhand from other American  English writers,  arbitrarily attached to a map of various train rides which are perfunctorily described but not effectively connected in any way with Mexico"

0,"hardly readable I expect so much from the concept, and yet I am more disapointed each time I read another of this authors books. This one had great potential, but I consistently and almost immeidiately found myself wondering about the plot connections  they were vague to say the least and just what was really going on. I did slog though it,skipping huge sections, hoping to get more insight into to wolf, but I feel Maniel was not developed nearly as completly as he could have been, and that certain love story elements were created at the very end just as an afterthought. I could go on, but I would not recommend this book, which is too bad, as the concept is great and the time period is interesting, but the author frankly I am amazed that she can get published. Very disapointing."
0,"Captain Beefheart Minus The Magic Just days before this tour began, the real Magic Band quit and were replaced by a bunch of studio session musicians who never heard Captain Beefheart before... and boy does it show! Other than the voice, you would think you were listening to a different band all together... thats because you are. This would be better billed as Captain Beefheart and The Last Minute Replacement Band! Add to this the fact that this tour took place between the infamous Unconditionally Guaranteed and Bluejeans and Moonbeams albums and features music from that time period... dreary stuff, especially considering how good the Captain was and would be again... but not in !"
0,"OH MY GOD! Please...in all honesty...save yourself the Blockbuster late fees on this one! This film has to be one of the most pathetic attempts of teen dilemma I have ever seen. Too many plots, too little time. The socalled romance between Halle Moore and Macon leaves little to the imagination. I actually didnt even want these two to even hook up! This ridiculous movie makes even the worst episode of  appealing. The most mildly satisfying characterand or plot of this film is the reefersmoking geriatric...and thats not saying a whole hell of a lot. Save your money and your time!"
0,"This card sucks When I looked at this card back in feburary of  i thought it was a good card. I installed it to windows ME and it worked great. BUT Try installing it to any windows NT platform and nothing but trouble. I did not expect for thier crummy software to work with NT but at least the driver so I could have a decent resolution, and that did not work. The worst thing is that dfx is NO longer a company. That means NO support in any way. I screwed up my computer numoruos times because of that stupid driver that does not work.I STRONGLY recommend NOT considering this card. ATI, pny technologies and Radeon are the best. Voodoo used to be a great card but their time of fame has gone and they need to go out silently."
0,"A spoiled dog and a spoiled owner Sure, Clara comes off as a spoiled dog with a better life than her fellow humans. And I can forgive Clara for that. But I had a tough time being as forgiving to Claras owner who ends up sounding even more spoiled and whiny than her cute pug. Kaufman, Claras owner, manages to tell us not only how she indulges her dog, but that she shops at the most expensive New York department stores, travels to Siberia in mink, and attends therapist sessions with her dog. I also found myself questioning her adoption of a child. Interestingly, that she admits she has some insecurities about adopting a child of a different ethnicity  but doesnt see the hypocirsy of her complete devotion to her pugs, whom I assume do not look like Kaufman either. A disappointing book. written with large heapings of hyperbole."
0,"My Reaction To Ultra Violet Media I will never fall for another situation, where I actually buy a product that offers the Ultra Violet copy. First, its difficult to access, and secondly, it isnt something you can access on your own computer and add to other devices.Any time a movie like this appears with that option, I buy it via ITunes, and hopefully others will follow. I will never fall for a purchase of it again, not ever."
0,"Definitely dont buy After reading all of the other glowing reviews, I decided to buy this  curling iron. I have tried about  different curling irons of this size, all of which just left ugly dents and creases in my long thin hair.

0,Previous reviews I was in the process of purchasing this cd but changed my mind based on the reviews of others. I looked over the title tracks again and realized that most of them were based on Christ. I will make a more precise review once I have purchased it and listened to the tracks myself as I too intend on celebrating the birth of Christ during this holiday season.
0,"Very Poor This book has a lot of problems. The code is buggy. The structure of the book makes little sense, and will gloss over many important things. The writing style is difficult and vague. I could not recommend this book any less."
0,"Could be a good product ...... but.... At first this item seemed very sturdy and ideal. However after only a weeks use, the black plastic ring that the inner tube rides in came out of the larger tube. This allowed the upper tube to cant over on an angle, and as a result the small pin used to adjust the height would barely hold on in the adjustment hole, and often would actually not hold. This renders the product useless as sold.I had to figure out what height I wanted to set the bar at, then drill a hole completely through and install a bolt and nut. It works now but.... no more adjustability. Small changes in the manufacture of this item would create a GREAT product. Unsatisfactory as is though."
0,"HORRIBLE PRODUCTWill not last more than  years This unit would fail randomly. Over the past  years of owning them, Ive had to exchange them twice and it may be a third. The headphones would just quit working without any indication. Ive never dropped them or abused in anyway. The components are just poorly built. The headphones are just not worth the money or trouble.Acoustic Research is owned by AudioVox corp. which when it comes down to support there is none. Ive had to replace these headphones twice by swapping out with Amazon already as AudioVox did not respond. AudioVox has won the battle.AudioVox will not back up their work on the headset.Very poorly made, will not last more than  years of use."
0,disappointing This book was disappointing to say the least. It doesnt have a lot of substance and I am very surprised about all the great reviews. Maybe Im missing something? Maybe the book is just for the pictures? But the pictures are not even that great. Maybe I should get into the childrens books business.
0,"Purchase from wish list  Grizzley Riser Block Kit I had to return item. It was purchased as a gift from his wish list. The tool I ordered could not be used without the purchase of another item on the list. He did not get that item and could not afford to purchase it himself, therefore it was returned. This will be the last time I purchase from a wish list for other people. The company charged a  restocking fee, they did not refund the postage and handling fee and I had to pay to ship it back to them. It cost me quite a bit for a useless item."

They graphics are terrible and the animation is very choppy. In fairness, there are games that are just too much for a bit console to handle, and this is one of them. This game is good for some cheap fun for  minutes but youll also be disgusted."
0,"Great for nostalgia, but horrible movie I began searching for this movie a few years ago, because I loved it as a child. Clearly nostalgia stays strong and memory fades because I had no recollection whatsoever of just how horrible this movie is.For starters, it drags on soooo incredibly long before anything happens with the stamp traveling. It was literally over an hour before any action happened. Everyone in the movie seems to be an avid stamp collector men on the streets, people in China, Australian mad men...that was so unbelievable! The plot is probably the worst out of any movie Ive EVER SEEN!!! The acting was horrible beyond belief.Despite my nostalgia, I dont even know if Ill let my children watch this movie, for fear of insulting their intelligence. Too bad I cant get my money back..."

0,"The Story of King Arthur Kindle ed. ASIN BLITTW I love the the tales of King Arthur  his knights and was really looking forward to reading this on my new Kindle.

It is illustrated and the illustrations are beautiful, but still, Definitely not worth it!"
0,"SSRI Madness Im no big pharma fan but what a joke. This film is like a midcentury propaganda film. It does nothing but make false claims. It claims antidepressants actually cause neurotransmitter deficiencies. That there is zero evidence that they help depression and that depression is basically made up by the drug companies. It shows footage from the Columbine shooting several times when only one of the shooters had been previously prescribed antidepressants. Obviously antidepressants werent the common link in that situation. I could go on and on. If you watch this, research the claims online and you will get a different picture."
0,"Poorly executed, a bit hard to follow This book was not well edited. I was amazed that a man with Brimacombes credentials had such poor grammar. Also, refers to one of the Queens Men as Anthony on one page and Arthur the next. How did the editor miss that? Brimacombes skipping around would be a little difficult to follow for someone with no previous knowledge of Elizabeth I. The only reason I did not discontinue reading this book was that there were enough new tidbits here and there to keep me interested, however, for one new to the subject, there are many better books out there."

0,"Disappointing Dead I listen to all kinds of music but the Dead are by far my favorite, and I own a bunch of it from all different periods. With all of the Dead music out there, weve got to be a little critical about the best and worst of it. This CD is by far the worst Dead Ive ever heard. I gave it an honest effort when I first got it and gave up, and then tried again after some time away  but it is no use. In general, the playing is sloppy and uninspired, but the biggest reason is the horrendous keyboard playing of Brent  it has a really unpleasent tone, he plays too much, and its too loud and too obvious. Using a poor analogy, over and over the band starts building a promising musical structure, a delicate house of cards, and Brents keyboads come in like a hammer to demolish the whole thing. I initially gave it  stars, but I have to be honest  it is that bad."
0,"dodgy covers after purchasing this cd, i was really not that happy with it. after purchasing another cd by academy street records a few years ago, i thought the standard would be about the same. the vocals on this cd were dodgy to say the least, very little real grunt behind of the lot of the tracks. the most tragic and insipid song on the cd was by far the vocals by baccara on wind beneath my winds....not a particularly difficult song to cover, but these girls have the most skinny thin, weak and wonky vocals ive ever heard. the arrangement could have been done so much better. also living on a prayer by hazell dean....sounds like karaoke at the pub....honey, sit down before you hurt youself!!i cant believe that another volume in this series was on amazon.com recently secondhand for over ......why would you bother????"
0,"Too Absurd To Be Worthwhile! You may not want to print this as its a putdown of Duhane. He should have his head examined for such a disgraceful novel, especial after writing MYSTIC RIVER, a superb piece of fiction. He says he writes to please himself. If so, he should either get his brain unaddled or quit fiction writing and only teach how NOT to write a very bad novel."
0,A misunderstanding Gothard does not teach that the oldtestament laws are to be kept for salvation. The oldtestament law shows a reflection of Gods nature in the whole scheme of things. The whole counsel of God is important to understand and the underlying principles behind them. This is what Bill Gothard teaches in the IBLP seminar ministry.
0,Terrible I used this machine for six months with some inconsistencies on the quality of the shots produced but overall it was ok. Then I started having problems with the filters getting clogged and tried all possible solutions I got from other customers and Breville with no luck.With disappointment I got a replacement unit and guess what?? Not a single shot of espresso... got clogged with the first shot!!!I just got tired of it and realize that if you want to get a good espresso without going to the hassle of all this you need to put more money down and get a different brand.
0,Not My Favorite I am a big fan of John Grisham books and I have purchased and read them all. This was not my favorite by far.I found the story to drone on and on and take forever to make its point. The main character is not a very interesting man and I found that I didnt really care about him which is quite sad since this is a true story. Grisham did not make me feel sorry for this innocent man. I hope the authors next book is fiction!
0,"Montessorilite The author brings too much of her own beliefs to the text which seems to stray somewhat from doctrinaire Montessori e.g. on page  the designation of a chapel as part of the Montessori environment. The bibliography consists of six texts, all written by Montessori herself, with no reference to other current texts. The illustrations and content seem amateurish compared to other cheaper texts available. The focus of the book is more on home schooling with a Montessori flavour. Try Gettmans Basic Montessori or Hainstocks Teaching Montessori in the Home."

0,"Negative Slant on WLS This book focuses so much on the negative of gastric bypass surgery that it makes me wonder if the authors research was up to date with the current procedures, death and complication rates. This is the first book that while claiming objectivity was actually negatively slanted. The personal stories were horrifying. For a more objective and thorough book I would suggest WLS for Dummies."
0,"Great picture, but... Our Philips was purchased in . Everything was wonderful about it until the day it died in July, . The power light turns on, but the screen remains black and you cant hear the power spin up. Based on other complaints found via Google and confirmed by the repairman who came by, there appears to be a recurring problem with an inverter board on Phillips TVs. Our repair guy gave us a  quote to replace that component. He suggested we buy a new TV because these televisions are also highly prone to have a power supply failure within  years, which would set us back another  within the next year or two. His comment that stuck with me was, these arent your daddys philips tvs. They are chinesemade and they slap a quality American brand on them, but they just aint what they used to be.Take that for what its worth, but I will never be buying a Philips brand appliance again."
0,Patronizing Tone That Never Delivers on Facts about Jesus For any thinking individual this book lacks deep substance and mimics common patronizing Christian dogma. The title and authors note leads one to believe that the book deeply accounts Christs life and what He stood for...however does not deliver in any meaningful way. I was very frustrated hearing the story about the leper which Lucado made up...it was redundant and did not illuminate any deeper understanding of Christ it was a waste of time and money.
0,"Tank cracked open, replacement did, too! This time, bad deal. Everyday I used two Holmes humidifiers, smaller ones than this model. Ive used them for two or three winters, storing them in the summer, and Ive had great results. Thats why I usually buy a Holmes product, when the choice is to be made.This time, though...hmmm. Bad luck. At first, the unit seemed to run perfectly. Though, I did think that I heard a crack when I was filling the tank, the first time. Anyway, after a week or so, all of a sudden I noticed that the humidifier had gone to reset and the tank had cracked all over like broken glass  a bit of water had leaked out, too.I ordered a replacement tank. That cracked after the first use.Id been convinced that the problem was the tank  not the main engine. But, perhaps I got a bad unit and any tank would crack on it. There was nothing to indicate that, though  it seemed to be running fine, until it cracked."

0,"Great in Theory.... I bought both this gun as well as the Paslode Framing Nailer. I used the Framing Nailer first to make walls to finish my basement and planned on using this gun for the finish work. The framing Nailer worked awesome, but I cannot give this gun the same rating. It either jammed, or froze up on me  out of  times I used it. In each case you have to take the gun apart, clean it out make sure everything is moving. I would not reccomend this particular gun to anyone, although when it does work it does the job its designed to do very well.Overall I liked the design and weight, and the fact that you can drive a  nail into very hard wood. the gun just is not reliable enough for everyday use. When I bought this it was the only choice I had there are several other brands that are compressorless now also."

However, intuition or hunch actually comes from years of experiences. But todays society, we need to get rich fast and enjoy life and we need a reason to make a judgement without real thinking. The result will be disasterous. Blink should not be a substitute of years of experiences and hard work."
0,GARBAGE I have never been so disgusted with a product in my life. I could only hope that Onkyo goes bankrupt due to the most unbelievably poor customer support they have given for this boat anchor. I will absolutely NEVER buy another Onkyo product and will do everything in my power to ensure that I spread this to every person possible. It is painfully obvious that Onkyo is aware that this thing is junk and should have recalled every one made and given any sucker who bought one  of there money back.

0,"Great concept, mediocre music I was looking forward to hearing this album, especially after I heard it was produced by Don Was. The concept of creating the music of a fictional artist was very interesting to me. However, after listening to the actual music I am disappointed. I do like several of these songs, but nothing here stands out to me as something that will hold up to the test of time. Rather than creating a separate musical persona, most of these songs sound like parodies of wellknown pop artists. Sometimes I wonder if the songwriters and musicians who worked on this project were intentionally trying to make Chris Gaines an unoriginal artist with secondrate material. If so, they succeeded."

Lyon is repititive and boring and honesltly, I couldnt the book aloud without the temptation to fall asleep. I cant give a book to read instead but I can tell you a book to stay away from. That book is Jesus in Disneyland. This book could have been summarized in  paragraphs, not over  pages.

0,"no use as is I bought this book thinking I would be getting good vegetarian mediterranean food, and found that I had to modify every recipe I have used from it to suit my taste. The modifications included adding a little bit of olive oil here and there to make the food taste better  I find that for example lentils boiled with some onion and garlic taste pretty plain, even after adding the spices suggested. Another thing I dislike about this book is that the author uses A LOT of garlic in her dishes to make up for lack of flavor, and also that she substitutes yogurt for olive oil in quite a few dishes  what a useless idea for those of us who dont even like yogurt. Finally the organization could be better. In summary there are some interesting ideas in her book but there are much better Mediterraneanhealthyvegetarian cookbooks on the market."

0,A Child Called Jesus There was only one thing that I found to be wrong about the film was the editting.

It is not really that interesting."

I tried it again with the same results. There is nothing about this, even what PROTECT means, in the manual.Im assuming that the unit had a short somewhere and this is its way of protecting the rest of the circuitry. All I know is that I just bought an amp will not stay on, which is useless to me. None of the other reviews here mentioned this but, when I did a quick web search, several other recent buyers are experiencing the same problem.This thing is now packed up and ready for the UPS guy to pick up. What a waste!"
0,"Obviously a Keys hater I live and work in the Florida Keys and found Ms. Williams book to be overly critical and in some cases, grossly inaccurate. Ms Williams seems to be looking to find fault instead of enjoying what is unique and wonderful about this area. Or perhaps it is easier for one to criticize than to appreciate. Ms. Williams is a fiction writer as well...perhaps this is just another work of fiction because her descriptions dont resemble the Keys I know and love."

0,"I can think of several adjectives good is not one of them Some adjectives that do come to mind melodramatic, torrid, anachronistic, unbelievable. After the rave reviews below, I expected something a whole lot better than what this turned out to be. Frankly, it was hard to finish. According to Encyclopedia Britannica, Sappho as poet has the power of standing aloof and critically judging her own ecstasies and pains but her emotions lose nothing of their force by being recollected in comparative tranquillity  but dont look for that kind of emotional selfcontrol here. As a lesbian, Id have been delighted to find a good historical novel about Sappho that didnt try to straighten her out, but Im unwilling to opt for one that depicts her as a circa  BC lesbian Harlequin romance heroine. The other characters are just as poorly drawn. Im very disappointed."
0,"Fails to deviver professional level content This is an out of the box Microsoft tech topical guide disguised as a tech manual. For the price, one would expect more thorough analysis. The CD is problematic, I had to reload  times and load files manually just to get all the sample files. This book turns to other MS apps everywhere MS agent, RDS, Front Page. There is not one sample app that stands alone, and it doesnt cover the MS products thouroughly enough to stand out there either. It also assumes you are programming on a machine with direct access to the web server. This is never true in my environment. All my apps are programmed on a remote machine then migrated upt o a production server. The two books I have come across that are worth their paper in this topic are ASP.in  days by SAMS and WROX Pro ASP. This is a great technology.

After using this lotion my  month old son developed a contact rash which lasted for just over a month, which was very disappointing seeing as I was given quite a bit of Burts Bees products at my baby shower and now will not use any of them for fear of this happening again. He was covered with red sores on his entire body after one use, and the poor guy was so uncomfortable! After this happened I began reading negative reviews that other mothers had written about this same product. Never again!"
0,"STILL WAITING We took the bait and ordered this book not through Amazon BEFORE Christmas . I had totally forgotten about it until I see a charge for .! Apparently they charge SH on each book, separately. Or I GUESS thats what they did. I cannot be certain since  as of this writing on  I STILL have not received the books. I went to the web site and the contact page for customer service is no longer available. Something tells me the company has packed up and moved on. Yeah, I feel like a sucker!"
0,"Wheres the action, wheres the story? I bought this book because of all the positive reviews, but I was very disappointed. I like a story line, more than just two people finding each other, and doing it. I thought that Sara was vain and immature and Derek missed the mark with me too, by sleeping with the woman that looked like Sara, therefore showing his love for Sara, PLEASE! Add stupid to Sara for believing that zinger.There was no real story appeal here, just primping, posturing, drinking and other immature, silly attention getting stuff that made me not like either Sara or Derek."
0,"CENSORED!!!! I was disappointed with the Calzonzin Inspector DVD. It is shorter than the original and, in some point, you miss the pace of the original film that ironicaly, was also projected in open mexican television with minor cuts.If you want the ORIGINAL Calzonzin Inspector, dont waste your money until the FULL version appears.In the other side, the image quality is excelent, but I have the feeling that also the actual audio was censored."
0,"edited like a bad music video I was hoping for something serene and peaceful that I could leave on in the background while I was writing. Instead, this piece is cut like a bad music video! For the subject matter its practically hyperkinetic! I have to wonder what ADD film school dropout assembled this. Cut cut cut! Maybe we could settle on a shot and let it breathe a minute before another cut, huh??? Instead of buying this here, check my local Goodwill. Mine will soon be on sale there."
0,Beware!!!!! Do not buy Memorex. I dont know any of these other people but my experience is the same. DO NOT buy these! I recorded  movies and lost them all. Countless hours of time wasted. I will never buy another Memorex product.
0,"Lets Grow Old and Fat and Drunk and Stoned Together I was treated to Johnny Depp and Benecio Del Toro in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas on DVD. Based on the late journalist Hunter Thompsons book, this one had a few very funny moments, and the notsosubtle message that reallife in Las Vegas can be as hallucinogenic as a drug trip, but spent too much time showing us how people on drugs walk funny and trash hotel rooms and rental cars without paying their bills, of course. It was a step up from Bill Murray in Where the Buffalo Roam, an earlier attempt to bring Thompsons antics to the screen, but still a pretty low step."
0,"plastic clutch plate on motor melted Great blender when it works, but the plastic clutch plate on the motor shaft will melt if you blend for more than  seconds at a time. Mine gradually melted until it would no longer work  a replacement part SPBTXN costs about  including shipping here on Amazon. Ill repair it and stick with if for now, but my next blender will have to have a metal clutch. Note that even the high rated Oster and Waring blenders that used to have metal parts now have a lot of plastic even the same models s that used to be great, so this is an industry wide cost cutting and lower quality enabling phenomenon. The glass pitcher on this blender is great in my opinion, although the gasket connection is difficult to clean. If anyone knows which blender is best, please let me know. Its not this one."
0,"Bad quality and in bad taste I bought this when I was tweleve the items within the kit are cheap. The only thing that survived after a few weeks was the pentacle pendant.And now I read the discription and think a teen witch KIT?!Seriously, bad taste.

Dont think a kit is going to lay it out for you and tomorrow morning youll be Sabrina. This isnt a game its a religion."
0,"poor message I found a popup book version of this at my local library. I dont enjoy potty humor, but being the parent of a year old boy, I know Im going to have to tolerate it. I couldnt care less about the fact that the book is about poop, and more power to you if it was a vehicle for opening discussion with your children about bodily functions as some reviewers have indicated.The reason I really disliked this story is that the hero gets pooped on, then once he thinks hes identified the culprit, he proceeds to retaliate in kind. That is bad enough, but that he does so without confirming guilt and while the other animal is sleeping sends the wrong message."
0,Give it up P Do people still listen to this crap.

0,"Not Free SF Reader This is so bad it is laughable. I mean, this is Ed Wood Plan  from Outer Space bad. The plot has holes you could drive either a Vogon Constructor fleet through, or perhaps even one of the Galactic Patrols antimatter planet weapons. To be avoided at all costs. Just rubbish. You are far better off with a novelisation of the V tv series, or something, for this sort of story."
0,Not as good as you would think I thought i had purchased an item that was definitely a steal. Product seemed sturdy when it arrived...decent weight...made of metal and i couldnt wait to try it out with my familiy. Unfortunately after one run down the slopes it was dented in...I believe some other reviews had similar comments and so now you can add this one to it. Maybe its weight specific didnt look into it before buying but either way its too bad that a product that seemed to have potential failed the way it did. Maybe its better for smaller children who are lighter weight but this definitely didnt hold up for an adult.
0,"Absolutely awful controls! DO NOT BUY I am a huge fan of the Tomb Raider series, and have played all five other games on my PC. I love them. I was so excited to get this one, and sooooo disappointed with the quality. Glitchy glitchy glitchy. Do not buy this game. The controls are terrible. While all other  games play out smoothly, this one is slow, stalls, goes blank some times, and takes minutes to load to new chapters. Now I dont have a fancy schmancy computer, but I have been able to play all the other games on it just fine without any hitch. This is just crap. It makes me feel like I have to go buy a  computer just to be able to play this  game! It probably runs better on a PS , so if you have one of those dont bother with the PC version. Thanks a lot Eidos, I totally wasted time and money and am warning future buyers to BEWARE!"
0,"Misinterpreting the word efficiency I have enjoyed other writing by Judge Bork. Unfortunately, in The Antitrust Paradox Judge Bork misinterprets the word efficiency as it applies to antitrust law. U.S. antitrust law was designed to advance Pareto or economic efficiency, not business or productive efficiency. That misunderstanding leads Judge Bork to propose, in essence, the following Carrollian extended syllogismAntitrust law advances efficiency and condemns monopolyConsumer welfare is the goal of antitrust lawConsumer welfare is advanced by lower pricesMonopolists are more efficient and provide lower pricesto consumers by economies of scaleMonopolists advance consumer welfareMonopoly is efficient and should be legalLest we forget, John D. Rockefeller lowered the consumer price of kerosene approximately tenfold while he was crushing smaller competitors. With all due respect to Judge Bork, I dont think that is the type of efficiency a free, commercial society needs."

My son loved this cage but we returned it after only two days because his hamster insisted on making a nest in the top wheel portion and then running in it, resulting in a big mess. There are slots in the wheel that allow the bedding and food and hamster poo to be thrown all around really gross. We returned it and got the single level habitat and added on the lazy outlook which has been a much better set up."

0,"bad experience with ClickInks Previously I have a had good experience with product delivery from ClickInks. But beware if they are out of stock and try to get your money back! I made the mistake of ordering a multipak with my debit card which ClickInks charged immedialtely before informing me that item was out of stock. I asked for an immediate refund so I could buy my product elsewhere....but after exchange of emails assuring me that refund was in the works,plus a phone call to their customer service to request prompt refund, after  days I finally had to file a claim with my bank which promptly reversed the charge.So beware of vendors holding your money without servicethis amounts to you giving them a free loan for  weeks! In todays economy many companies have cash flow problems and are reluctant to refund you your  cos it looks good for their bottom line..i.e., they cant get a loan from the bank, so they get a loan from YOU!"
0,Faulty manufacturing ASINBIWLWG Tripp Lite PR Amp DC Power Supply VAC Input to .VDC OutputI received this item and it was faulty in that it was only putting out  or  volts DC and would not power my  volt device.

I would not recommend purchase of this product.
0,"a fun, quick read This was an intersting book, I bought it because I enjoyed Mr. Gunnells Illustrated Firebird Buyers Guide.

0,"Planned obsolescence, poorly supported under warrenty. Firstly, the Capresso Infinity does a nice job of grinding coffee  the burrs are relatively highquality, and the device does what its supposed to.However, it is made of relatively cheap plastic, and a poor internal design allows coffee grinds to reach the internals of the grinder despite regular cleaning. I bought two Infinities, and within a year started experiencing issues on one and had the other break entirely. Capresso kindly offered to replace or repair the broken one, but at a cost of   nearly the full cost of a new device, and thats before the shipping charges. That the machine malfunctioned  months after purchase deepens my belief that this is a case of planned obsolescence high repair costs likely subsidize the low initial charge.Do yourself a favor in the long term, and spend more on a nonCapresso machine up front."

0,"What a downer!!! Whenever I first saw this book on sale at Barnes and Noble, I quickly snatched it up and was ecstatic to find such a book. I had high hopes for this book as the author, Sean Gibbons, compared the project to the gonzo journalism of the late H.S. Thompson.I have read  of the Thompson stuff and will say that this book is a pile of dung in comparison. This book lacks creativity and insight, the two things that made Thompson a genius.Comparisons aside, the author clearly missed out on what made being a phish fan so great, a sense of community amongst the fans. Gibbons almost seems to ridicule the people who will most likely be reading this book Phish fans.My recommendation to everyone is to save your money."
0,"SAME OLD STORY JUST A NEW FACE After having gastric bypass surgery myself this book gave me NO new insight on the trial and triumphs of weight loss. This book was more of a sales pitch to sell a certain variety of vitamins and to throw a few names around. Makes me wonder was this book written as a  hour commercial.Also where the recipes written by her and tested. I tried a few recipes and not only did one of them not turn out but can you talk about tough and chewy, truly a bariatric nightmare. In order for a recipe to be healthy it needs to be able to be digested first."
0,"DO NOT BUY THIS DVD! The previous reviewers are right on the money. This is one of the greatest jazz films ever made, but this particular edition is a cheapo ripoff with truly rotten picture and sound quality. It seems to have been made from an umpteenthgeneration videotape copy of a scratchy old kinescope. Dont waste your money! Wait for whoever owns the rights to do it properly in the meantime, get the authorized VHS version."
0,"No Story The first fifty pages of this book are interesting and absorbinga host of seemingly fascinating characters and situations are introduced, and the author has beautiful prose.Unfortunately, this book has no plot, and failed to inspire any emotion whatsoever. It is a collection of miserable people who undergo no character development. Nothing happens, except that everyone is miserable. None of the characters are sympatheticthe reader cannot connect to them because they are pure creations of meaningless beautiful words, selfpity, and inexplicable neuroses. The narrator, eighteen year old Rose, fails to make an impression. She is so absolutely passive that she has no personality.So I could not recommend Heir to the Glimmering World. It is pretentious, plotless, and uninspiring."
0,"like the case, hate the knife! Bought this to replace another electric knife I used without complaint for  years. Love the box that fits blades and fork here, but thats it. While the knife works well to cut, it kills my hand to use it. Having to hold down on switch while you carve causes my hand to cramp way before Im done slicing a brisket or carving a turkey. Tired of complaining every time I use this. Im tossing this."

0,"Weird pronounciation I bought this product a few months ago.I started using the cds and everything seemed ok at first.I also take classes in russian.My teacher is russian.Im taking classes for  months now.As i was getting better i realized that some of the words where pronounced very wierd.For example the female speaker pronounces the word shto which means what as chto while the male speaker pronounces it regularly as shto.This is not standard russian accent.Ive never heard of any russian saying chto.So i thaught that this must be some regional accent.I even asked my teacher about this and she laughed.She said that she is not aware of any region in Russia where shto is pronounced as chto.Also some word endings are pronounced wrong.For example a b at the end of a word should be pronounced as p,while a b in this course is always a b no matter where it is positioned in a word.Has anyone else noticed these?A review of a native speaker of russian would help a lot."
0,"disappointing I dont care for this video. Most of the time is spent either listening to Rocki talk or doing kegel exercises, which I can do in the car.

0,"Girls, Guns and GStrings The Andy Sidaris Collection Andy didnt have  films, he had one long one. All the stories were basically the same story, retold over and over again, with most of the same actors appearing in each film, creating more of a part serial. I expected Gstings as advertised, but was disappointed here, too. The actors could not act and it was too much of a stretch to imagine a handful of bimbos being federal secret agents. The guys were all muscle and no brains either. The plots were weak and merely retold in each film, with the same company, locale and characters featured. All in all, a big disappointment."
0,"Wrath of the Titans This movie was a disappointment. Defineately does not measure up to the first. On the plus side, it had lots of cool special affects. I could not thing of anything else that impressed me."
0,"Carly Simon  Yes Yes it seems Carly is stuck in time. Only the most die hard fans would like the cuts demoed on the Amazon to buy page, much less purchase the title.The voice is the same, and very welcome, but one would think that by now Carly would have moved on to something more fresh then the old Joan Baez style of presentation.Carly looks great, and young, on the cover. Makes us old dogs feel young again as we are her peers. Perhaps it is worth the price of the CD just to get that young feeling back, but the music just doesnt cut it, unfortunately."

0,year old speaks out I speaking as a  year old girl hated this book. I was forced to read it in th grade and it was a pretty good book but after a while it got very boring.

It looks like someone copied it off an old VHS tape in the garage for  bucks... there are obvious rolling lines during the darker scenes quite a few in this movie and the audio is almost mute unless you crank your TV up beyond reasonable levels. I was hoping for a good copy of a favorite movie... still looking after returning this twice... I suggest you look elswhere.
0,"Not delivered with everything Well, first of all, it took forever for the delivery. Then the book doesnt come with the CD! Im a visual learner and I was hoping the book came with everything because the Ad didnt say it was being delivered without the CD. In other words, someone lost the CD and sold the book without it. That should have been advertised! See belowThe accompanying CD features PrepLogictm Practice Tests, Preview Edition. This product includes one complete PrepLogic Practice Test with approximately the same number of questions found on the actual vendor exam.

0,"Not about Wrongful Death, but about dealing with death This book is hardly about wrongful death. It is the story of one persons attempt to deal with the sudden and unexpected death of a spouse. Certainly there are some elements of the wrongfullness of the death of her husband portrayed in the book. However, the author is primarily focused on her own pain, suffering and inability to deal with the death and subsequent activities.One most definitely has sympathy with the author and her family for their loss. The writing is a celebration of the misery brought on by the death. A similar tale could be told of any sudden and unexpected death of a loved one."

0,"Very disappointing I have always been a big Epson fan. However, I have been extremely disappointed with this printer. First of all, it burns through ink cartridges, which gets expensive. Secondly, I am constantly having to clean the nozzle heads to prevent gaps which uses even more ink so that the text on my documents is legible. Its so bad I have to clean them before almost every print job, and even then I rarely get a page to print out cleanly. Also, the printer has major problems with the paper feed  mostly when trying to print doublesided. After every page I have to push the paper feed button. Very annoying for large documents. Finally, when printing photos or anything that has a lot of ink coverage the colors are terrible. Its been so frustrating I am thinking of forking over for a laser printer. Avoid buying this printer!"
0,Not good military history I was looking for a one volume history of the desert war. Ended up picking War Without Hate. Bad choice this is not a very good military history. Two examples of this. First the book devotes more pages to the true story behind the movie The English Patient than it does to Operation Battleax. Battleax gets  or  lines the English Patient gets about  pages. Second there is very little discussion of logistics the key determining factor in the theater.Those are just two examples. The book comes across as more lightweight pophistory than a serious study of the campaign.

0,"Pretty mediocre This book wobbles between weak attempts at humor, brief examples of Idiot Bosses which arent used to demonstrate any points, and inane advice on how to get along with idiot bosses. The author doesnt succeed in any of these areas.Ill save you the money His advice on how to deal with idiot bosses is to not get upset about their idiocy, which I think is better summed up by the Serenity PrayerGrant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,the courage to change the things I can,and the wisdom to know the difference.Of course, he doesnt really give any advice on how to actually DO this. I think anyone who is really having problems at work dealing with a difficult boss look at another book, since this one wont help them at all."

If there are any leaks in the system youll be there for weeks doing your bleeding. With all new plumbing and fittings, leaks are inevitable. This will just draw more air into the system and you find the bleeding and pumping goes on forever. With the two man operation leaks show up and youre able to tightenfix the problem areas. It will draw a vacuum as advertised but the included cup is rather small and becomes messy as you empty it. Allinall the old conventional pump and hold system works better."

The book was in poor condition when I received it, which I was not expecting and was very unsatisfied with. Because i trust the seller, I believe that the serious spine damage and heavily dented in corners was due to shipping. However, all the pages appear to be in fantastic condition and none of the pages seem to be missing.I will have to get the spine repaired, but I would probably buy from this seller again."
0,"Lame Wasnt exactly what Id call a so bad its good type of film just bad all around. Awful production values, worse acting, and lazy writing. The ending isnt as shocking as the synopsis and reviews would have you think. Ever see The Vanishing? Remember how bogus the ending of that was after all the hype? Thats about the size of it."
0,"Big Pun romances, destroys Big Punisher is a fascinating amalgamtion he is at once a  pound man who romances the ladies, seducing them with his hottub antics. He is also a true gangster capable of hurting people as he clearly demonstrates on the album. If you like Hiphop of the lowest common denominator check out this album."
0,Order was cancelled by Vendor I did NOT receive the CD ordered because it was cancelled by the vendor. Kinda Bummed. I was looking forward to getting that CD. But my money was credited back to my account  pronto. Very quick response and messaging from vendor that they were unable to send the music.
0,"Dont buy the Kindle version get the book instead The book is excellent the Kindle version is wasted money, simply because the Table of Contents cannot be used to navigate from chapter to chapter. Some of the links are broken, so clicking on the link to Chapter , for example, brings you to the title page of the book, or some other random page.Because this is a book of pivotal importance to my research, I had to buy the physical book after buying the Kindle version. Dont waste your money on the digital version  buy the book instead."
0,"Someone Tell Me What Happened Wowwhat a difference a few years and a new singer make. This is probably the most brutal Priest album ever. Not that that is bad but the one thing that ruins this album are the lyrics. Glenn Tipton is no Rob Halford when it comes to lyrics, and good lyrics go hand in hand with Priest songs. The music is averagesounds like the guys have been listenening to Slayer or Testament a bit too much. Ripper has a great voice, close to Halfords but obviously younger. Ian Hill and Scott Travis rumble on as usual. The best cuts from this album are Death Row, Cathedral Spires and Burn in Hell. All the material here is tight and well played but is a bit boring. Do yourself a favor and get Priest Live . It really showcases Rippers voice and is awesome. Pass this one up."

0,"broken after a little over  years Bought a Badger   HP unit on  and it is now making very loud sharp noises. It lasted  years and a few months, just long enough for the year warranty to expire. A previous InSinkErator unit a few years. Time for a different brand."
0,"Poor Carburetor I will agree with many others on this site. The unit is hard to start and will not run after a short operating time. The reason is the carburetor. The thing is poorly designed and TroyBilt and Briggs  Stratton will not stand behind this product.The unit comes with a two year warranty which is one reason I bought it. But when it does not start or run and you take it in they will tell you it is a carburetor problem and that it is your fault for using bad  dirty gas. They will not honor the warranty. The same gas that runs your mower, weed whacker, chain saw, pressure washer and generator just fine. They also fail to mention that the gas cap is indeed vented. The usual repair charge is  but after only getting  difficult starting uses in less than  months I returned it for a refund.I have never received such rude customer service as I did from TroyBilt. Something tells me they are used to hearing about the poor performance of this unit.Caveat EmptorI am looking at a McClane now."

0,"Ugh.........it was like torture. I couldnt even get past the third chapter. Maybe Im just not deep enough for this one...who knows, but its awful. I have read other books my Ms. Morrison and found them enjoyable, but this one was so confusing and I just didnt have the patience to muddle on."
0,Awful book This book is  case studies and very old statistics and  basic theory.Ive been working with online retail since  and I thought it would help me improve my business.

After  or  pages I found out that the entire book is loaded with insignificant information...
0,"Packaging and Fragrance Need Improvement Youll have to transfer this into another portable container if you want easy dispensing. The entire lid comes off, making precise dispensing impossible.The fragrance needs to be improved. Can it smell less manly and still repel bugs?"
0,"Disappointing I had high hopes for this book, as the subject is a very interesting one. Alas, Ms Hawkes writing style would surely be a boon to insomniacs if it could be condensed and put into a bottle. And quite aside from its potent lethean side effects, it is at times immensely irritating, as in and now I am going to talk about the next thing I intend to talk about... Aaargh. And then there is the frustrating defect of much writing from those of academia, the justwhointhehellamIwritingfor? neurosis the book seems aimed at a general lay audience, yet esoteric terms and proper nouns are tossed off like so many sparkles on a birthday cake, words familiar only to those with a graduate education in the subject. It reminds me of an old Monty Python skit, about the RAF pilots trying to make sense of their banter.But, the book is nicely illustrated. Whoopie."
0,Deserves the razzy award PLEASE DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY! This movie is absolutely horrible and deserving of this years razzy award. Sharon Stone just took the money and ran. Trust me. The use of the title Basic Instinct on this loser is a travesty.
0,"Not selective enough for general use As the subtitle indicates, this is not a reconstruction, but materials for one. Before they can be made general use of, they have to be screened by specialists of the different subfamilies. In the present state of the work, Orel  Stolbovas comparisons are often laxist both on the phonological and the semantic sides. In addition, the tables on pages  have several printing errors. See review article in German by Kammerzell in Indogermanische Forschungen ,  ."
0,Enjoyed the vocals  instrumental too long I saw the movie and loved the African vocals by Ayub Ogada and Geoffery Oryema. The background music is lush and romantic  when taken in small doses on the big screen. The extended compositions on the CD just drag on. I would recommend that you get a CD by Ayub Ogada instead of this soundtrack.
0,"It doesnt make sense I rarely flame a book, because I know what it takes to put one together. However, The Bridge doesnt make sense for so many reasons. The characters are not real. I cannot imagine a mother committing suicide right after giving birth. It is not realistic to believe food would start flowing back to the cities after a pandemic virus wipes out  billion people. And who kept the power grid running during this disaster?Yes, there is a scifi premise regarding first contact sort of, but humanity tends to react a bit differently in the light of megadeath than what was depicted here."

0,"Great themes, poor music Its been a while since Mr. Hunter released a real album, so this disc contains a lot of fresh ideas, both in melody and lyrics.Ive always perceived IH as a rebel poet, and the man is back in true form. How unfortunate that the vocal delivery is somewhat weak IH is and has never been a great singer, but he compensates with emotion and a real songwriting gift too bad his voice sounds tired on most tracks. The lyrics are enclosed, and thats a real plus.But the musical arrangements are poor, and even if the roster of musicians includes some familiar names if youre into people like Tom Petty, Bryan Adams, etc., the performances are dull at best.Most IH albums have their ups and downs, at least to my ears. His latest happens to have more downs than usual, but there are still a few tracks above par."

Wont work on our new PS and LG top of the line bluray player. Yes, both have the latest updates. I would not purchase until they can get this defective bluray fixed. The digital copy is a joke  you get  chance to download and it can only be used on the computer you download to."
0,"NOT for couples, this book is for parents only. I was highly disappointed with this book  it is HEAVILY geared towards parents, and even pointedly says that couples who dont have children are not fulfilling their purpose. When the book stated that Take Your Daughter to Work Day was part of the feminist agenda, I gave up. There is a handful of devotions that are, in fact, geared towards couples.  of the book, however, is blatantly written for extremely conservative parents. The title of the book should convey that."
0,antisocial behavior is not really that much fun If I ever acted like this in real life I would be dead. Its not really fun wrecking stuff. My dad had his tires slashed one time by a thug and he coundnt get to work and we lost a lot of money because we couldnt afford to buy new tires because it was just Christmas and we spent all our money. Its not fun to think about that. Why did Tony Hawk make this game? Doesnt he have kids or care about kids thinking this is fun?

0,"Complicated, Repetitive and Overdone I bought this DVD to calibrate my new  Samsung plasma. All I really wanted from a calibration disk was do this til this happens or adjust this to look like this. This DVD gives you the history of TV, of DVD, and makes the actual calibration of the TV far more difficult and convoluted than it needs to be. You pay for a history lesson. You might as well just look up how to calibrate your TV on the internet using Blu Ray disks like Ice Age or Dark Knight or whatever. Oh, this isnt really relevant to the functionality of the DVD, but the narrators voice made me wanna sleep  minutes into listening to it. Consider buying something else in my opinion."

0,"Needs more quality control Based on the many positive reviews, I think I got a bad unit. I could only get sound and poor quality sound at that out of the left channel. I got a refund and replaced it with an Accurian from Radio Shack, which sounds much better. On the positive side its a goodlooking product. Id recommend purchasing in a store that allows nohassle returns just in case you get a lemon like I did."
0,"Flimsy, poor quality Owned one of these several years ago, and the quality has gone down drastically on the newer models. The wood is more flimsy. Cant lock the width in place. Bought one of these recently and tried to tighten it snugly in a doorway, and the wooden lever snapped in two. I had to throw it away the same day I received it. Cheap plastic grate. If you have base boards, this wont fit because the width between the base boards is different than the width between the walls higher up. Also, everytime you take the gate down, you lose the place of the width you had selected. If you dont want to go to the hassle of taking the gate down, you have to climb over it, and that becomes a pain. Would recommend one of the more expensive metal gates that can open without having to remove the gate. You get what you pay for. Nuff said. Dont expect this gate to last."
0,"Doesnt warm up a room It keeps turning itself off before the room is warm. I have another DeLonghi about the same size that works just great, but I couldnt find the same one so I purchased this one. Its terrible!"
0,not the book I thought it would be I purchased the book for a friend of mine who unfortunately had to have their dog put down. However upon receiving the book and reviewing it chose not to give the book as a gift. I felt that the description of the books contents were totally misleading. The book is more for someone whose pet is still alive and they are anticipating puting it to sleep. Not a book on coping with the loss after you have put your pet to sleep. So unfortunately I did not feel the book was a good choice as a gift. How disappointing.
0,"Cant listen to it on my PowerBook It locks up the machine when I try to read this CD. Googling, I found other people with similar problems with this CD. I dont know if it is some anticopying thing or what, but if I cant listen to it on my computer it is a showstopper, so Im sending it back."

I must have bought the wrong product. Need something more for red blotches. either way, this product comes out very green and u must rub in very well. I do see anything special about it at all."
0,"Has Parabens. Bought this cream for a gift and when I received it read the ingredients, it contains all the Parabens in the market, so I cannot really say anything about the product myself because I didnt try that on my skin, according with my friend is a good moisturizer, but I wont buy again, for me or anybody else."
0,"A few useful bits, but... the one thing I need to say about this book is what Whitney has to say about forgiveness... No author gets everything right but this is downright heretical. Whitney says that you dont forgive until asked for forgiveness, and goes so far as to say that Jesus wasnt forgiving his executioners while on the cross. This is the kind of scripture warping that is perpetuated by an angry and bitter person to justify their sin. I would not recommend this book under any circumstance."
0,Sent back immediately  made of small rectangles of sheepskin Not worth ordering  was sent back immediately. The seat face was stitched together from x inch pieces of sheepskin.

Expected a better product from this provider.

If thats what youre looking for, and its a decent price for that board, then youre OK. However, it youre expecting to have the Silicon Image SATA RAID  controller on board this MOBO, youll be disappointed when it arrives...."

0,"Sadly decieved I saw the original film in a theater. Can still recall the emotional impact of the sounds and the images. For years Amazon advertised only an Australian format cassette, and so I was delighted when I saw that it was finally available in DVD format. I so looked forward to seeing and hearing the great film on my HD  TV. No such luck. This is a total fraud. The advertising should have indicated that it was merely a mechanical transfer that could properly be seen only in the oldest TV format. The whole job was done in a cursory fashion. The subtitles have strange spellings. The sound is not all that great either. A shameful product. Five stars for the film, none at all for this DVD."
0,Are you kidding? It appears that someone took a game of DD and tried to write a story from it. The charactors wish they had even two dimensions. Poorly written tripe. Those giving this five stars must be in the employ of the publisher. and any publisher who would waste paper on this is suspect.
0,"Not Worth It! These rings are as nonstick as crazy glue on sand paper.

Everything else, though, is mediocre lets mention photography mostly uninspired fixed camera, with extremely unprofessional zoomins and superimposed text where did they find those fonts?.

0,Has this guy worked in the industry? I have been working in the printing industry for many years. I can tell when someone has actually worked in the industry or just teaches the subject. This book has many flaws due to the author only having classroom knowledge on the subject. I brought this book to my employees and we found ourselves laughing out loud. This book spends too much time on small details about paper and printing that are never used. It simply makes the subject harder than it actually is. The book seems like it was just thrown together with poor quality black and white photos used as illustrations. I found words in bold print with little or no definitions next to them and could not be found in the glossary as well. I bet that the only place you would find this book being tought is in the authors classroom.
0,"This is a major disappointment after Bonfire I really liked Bonfire, but A Man in Full is a tremendous letdown. The reporting is great, but this is supposed to be a novel, not a magazine article.

After sitting through . hours of helter skelter excitement, I turned to my wife, and said This movie could now end a million different ways. I think any one of these million ways would have been OK But the makers of this movie chose number ,,. The entire frog thing is someone on the director or producer seat with a drug fantasy, or perhaps they wanted to laugh at the silly people like me who rented it.

0,"Poorly written I was extremely disappointed in this book. In a time when young Indian authors are showcasing their literary talents, this was a major setback. Characters are superficial, dialogue was immature and the story was unbelievably contrived and silly. It was chosen as our book club selection and  out of  rated this as one of the worst books weve ever read in our  years of book club. Im still trying to figure out what Ms. Mukherjee and the publishers were thinking when she allowed this to be published. If youre interested in this genre of books, read Rohint Mistry, Mohsin Hamid, Arundhati Roy. They are amazing storytellers!"

0,"They do write catchy songs. But so does Britney Spears. Franz Ferdinands shallow debut album is arguably the worst thing that has happened to Rockn Roll Revival so far. If theyre too lazy to give any meaning to what they do, maybe we should feel too lazy to buy their records. Who said danceable music has to be music of no importance? Buddy Holly, The Beatles, New Order, Pulp... All proved you dont have to sell out to produce amazing disco tunes. I wasnt surprised to learn that Franz Ferdinand took half of their inspiration from Duran Duran. Bands who make danceable music for the sake of it aint what Rockn Roll needs!"
0,"Mediocre at best. This book was difficult to get through. It had some good information but nothing that we didnt know alreayd and for the most part it was so dry.We did read a book recently called Villa Appalling!

Not only was it easier to read but it actually had guidelines and helpful advice on how to live in homeowner associations and how to protect your money.That is what is important to us, how to protect our money."
0,"I dont get it Reading this novel was like trying to ski downhill with snow up to your thighs. I kept thinking that I would eventually understand what some of these positive reviewers were going on about. My mother and I read this book at the same time and she finished first. She warned me that if I was confused after the first  hundred pages I would not feel any better after  pages. I should have listened. Thousands of beautiful words strung together does not make a story great if there is little to no plot, character development or connection to reality. I wish I understood what the author is trying to say but it really shouldnt be that hard. I like challenging novels but I just didnt feel any reward when I reached the last page."

0,Xbox adapter What a waste. Would not work with our gateway network. After many attempts including trying to contact Microsoft and Xbox for infoassistance we gave up in frustration and bought the higher priced newer adapter. The new one works fine but this one would have required that we reconfigure our home network in order to use. The error messages informed us that we could find the info online but could not locate and I am a student in knowledge management!. We also sent it back to Microsoft stating that it was unusable and they just sent it right back without any explanation. Poor product and poor service.
0,"This book is awful. Give it a miss. Even for the free Kindle version, I found myself thinking, I want my money back!This book is a laundry list of rules and regulations of writing, grammar and style that are incredibly outdated. And how can you trust a language coach who, in his effort to teach us to write clearly and using simple words, writes, This book has no pretension about it whatever,  it is neither a Manual of Rhetoric, expatiating on the dogmas of style...Expatiating, indeed. lolThere are countless books out there that will help you improve your writing and knowledge of the English language. This definitely isnt one of them!"
0,"Couldnt get all the way through the book  I was sadly disappointed to find I did not like this book at all after all the glowing reviews it received here.

I bought the book as a gift based on the reviews here, then a copy for myself so I could get in on the fun. I forced myself through half the book before I just tossed it and promised my father a replacement  something Id read already and knew he would enjoy.

0,"Very Poor Quality Broke Within Minutes Bought this for my five year old boy for Christmas. He loved it but accidentally dropped it on the carpet within minutes of opening. It disintegrated and metal pins were everywhere, which my other four yo son decided would be fun to pick up and throw. Complete disaster. My  yo was very sad. Great idea, but significant design flaw in product in that the clear acrylic front is connected to the body by cheap plastic pins. These break without much effort at all. Once broken there is nothing to hold the metal pins in. They go everywhere. Makes you wonder what they possibly could have been thinking when they made this.Summary looks great on the website and kids love this product, so seems like a great idea to buy it, but do not buy this one. Cheap piece of junk. You will be disappointed."
0,"Dont bother if youre a beginner I purchased this video after reading several books suggesting knitting from the top down being the BEST way to make sweaters as it allows for trying on during the knitting process. As a beginner, I decided to learn about it before the  piece way was set in my mind. This dvd was no help at all. Frankly, I was shocked Knitting Daily released this. Perhaos if I was a more experienced knitter, I may have been helped. This is definitely not an Elizabeth Z type demo dvd. You do not knit along with the presenter. She doesnt even knit the sweater for you to watch. The title should have been something like Knitting from the Top Down SuggestionsHints. To say its a workshop is very misleading."
0,"Dont bother I am not sure why I had such high hopes for this film, but I was sorely disappointed by Disneys The Black Hole. The film is horrible beyond compare. Its premise is basically a retelling of , Leagues Under the Sea without any of the grandeur of the s classic.This films should have succeeded yet in my book it is an utter failure. The costumes, the incredible cast and the music all should have insured a great movie. Instead it is an overly dark, brooding film with huge lapses in logic and incredibly bad science that undermines any chance of enjoying the film. The characters act with no discernable or believable motiviations. The actors had to put up with scenes that are comparable to Irwin Allens Lost in Space. Go buy , Leagues or Tron instead!I found the movie so badly put together that I just cannot recommend it, not even if I found the film in the . bin would I buy it. What a disappointment!"

0,"Garbage In  Garbage Out This book proves the old computing adage! Its too bad the author doesnt have any solid research to back up the wild claims she makes about Gershwins life. Too bad there isnt less than one star on amazon.com ratings, this book deserves far less."
0,"It requires a separate neutralizer, which wasnt provided. ... It requires a separate neutralizer, which wasnt provided. It also said you need their special case.

0,Nonsensical story that has very little value This book was written for pure shock value and nothing more. The ridiculous slang that he creates makes it almost impossible to enjoy the story in any sense.The story is predictable and not very entertaining. If someone was wanting to read a book on gang rape and the evils of mis spent youth then I am sure that there are other books out there there are at least written in such a way that you dont need an interpreter for all the fabricated words in this little book.I find it hard to believe that so many give this book a  star review. It scares me a bit to find out what my fellow human beings find as a quality piece of work.I was expecting more and was terribly disappointed. Certainly wont be reading this one again.
0,Colloquial Italian Its hard to evaluate as you folks have only the CD but not the book that is supposed to go with it. I am keeping my eyes open to find the book. I enjoy languages and really like the Colloguial series but I find having only the CD hard. Its curious to me that you would sell the CD but not the companion book.
0,"terrible design I absolutely agree with the other reviewers...after using this carrier twice, I cant figure out what the heck Ive done to it because there are so many buckles....now I cant get it on at all!! I wish I wouldve researched more before registering for this item...It was a complete waste of money."
0,"Descriptive and vivid but no theme... The Skin Im In, by Sharon G. Flake is an okay read. The book is very descriptive including vivid details that help the reader be interested, yet it had no theme. The only reason I kept reading was because the awesome descriptions but I definitely do not think it is a mustread. I also would not recommend this book. The reader should be atleast  as it deals with teen issues."
0,"Not as good as I thought As the other reviewer said it does smell like bug spray crossed with picklesin the beginning. It does smell better after a little while, but not an extraordinary smell by any means, nothing distinctive and that would make you want to rush out and buy another bottle. Generic classic perfume."
0,"not worth the time it took to write I love books... old, new, classic, modern... rare to find a written word not worth reading..Until now. Too many words describing nothing. The plots seems like it was thought of over a pk and as a way to link bad sex scenes.This is the unfortunate product that publishers are schlepping at us because we want sex and and something to make us feel like our own lives arnt that bad. The ONLY thing that is good about this compared to everything else coming from the fantasy genre is that is DOES NOT have vampires in it.There are some great historical novels out there that are worth every penny. Stick to those and save yourself from tedium."
0,"Trashy. People made such a big commotion about this film when it first came out. We follow the life of a young boy, Billy, his harsh  cruel past... the reasons that make him turn into a Psychotic Serial Killer dressed in a Santa suit. Some portions of the film maybe disturbing to some viewers, its better that you keep it away from children. Badlow budget filmmaking, but overall has an effective feelingatmosphere.This was the weakest slasher film of its generation."
0,"Pump never worked and was missing parts! Same complaint as the previous reviewer who wrote that the pump never worked  mine was even missing parts when the air mattress arrived! I now have to go to both Target and a sporting goods store to see if I can find another pump, which is priced at just ten dollars less than the entire airbed package that included the pump in the first place  does that marketing make any sense to any of you?Buy the airbed separately from the pump in case the pump is malfunctional and needs to be returned on its own. This will save you the trouble of running around your hometown looking for another one, as I get to do today with a fever and the flu  while waiting for my new queen size bed to arrive."

0,"Not as good as the first.

0,"Poor Quality It was a poorly made piece of junk made in China. The welding was very unfinished and alignment of the hinges was so bad the door didnt close properly. If that wasnt bad enought, the space inside was very limited, and not all of the shelves are movable. Save your money."
0,"Simply NOT OK, I was wrong... again. It was not about what I thought. If I had done a better job of research before I bought the book, I would have saved myself the bucks, but...Of course, I read it... I bought it and did not think to waste the money. That was also a bad decision. I have now wasted the money on the book and the time it took to read it."
0,I would give it a zero if I could Like the other said this is a reprint of three novels. I wait for each new book by this author and I was really disappointed when this book arrived and it was reprints packaged in a hardcover and a hardcover price. Some of these authors are really testing my patience by continually floating old works packaged as new works. I am sending my copy back for a refund and stating the reason why. I think everyone else should do the same unless you dont already have copies of the original stories. This is the only way these authors and the publishers are going to get the message.
0,"Extremely Disappointing Ive really enjoyed this series and was anxious to read the latest installment. What a disappointment.The plot was extremely confusing and uneven. It seemed to flop back and forth between two separate crimes and a totally unrelated situation while attempting to tie all them together...of which the author did a very poor job. And the conclusion was very lame, being we knew nothing about the person and had no reason to care about them. None of the characters were welldeveloped, including the ones weve met before in previous installments. I finished the book last night, and Im still trying to put together in my mind all the pieces in this jumbled mess.I do recommend this series, but dont start with this one...and dont worry about skipping it entirely."
0,"You know, theres a couple of songs you probly want to iTune... Well, I heard the first track on the radio, so, what the heck! Now having listened to it, the stars of track and field, and Judy and her dream of horses, for me, are really the radioworthy listenable catchy tunes. The stuff in between is, you know, indieshlock, blah blah twangy nothingness. Though, dont get me wrong, would be very suitable for say, trying to seduce  something, depressed, slightly higher than average IQ, lonely, journal keeping, liberal arts degree program dropouts. note For Engineering degree dropouts, DEVO Hardcore Vol. suits this purpose Oh, and hey, whats the deal with the singer? He sounds like a disaffected English guy with a cleft palate and a hare lip, who has a predeliction for baby talk. Dont get me wrong though, it really works on those two songs!"
0,"Diminishing Returns Hunt for Red October was brilliant  a wellresearched, taunt tour de force! Sum of All Fears was as good as the movie made from it was bad. And now The Teeth of the Tiger... Half as many words as Clancys previous novels, and only a tenth of his previous inspiration. The book seems forced, drifts along with a really implausible plot, and is populated with twodimensional, cartoonlike characters. I was shocked at the facile plot device in the middle of the book  I was literally shouting at the author while reading This is beneath you! No one can be good all the time  but this one just seems to be ground out as the obligatory next installment. Reread one of the jewels above instead of spending your money on this turkey."
0,"One Trick Pony Joss Whedon has indeed turned into a One Trick Pony. In every one of his works, one of the characters is stabbed with something may it be a harpoon, a spike, sword, etc. This Whedon incarnation is just like the others. Like all his works he is unsure how to move forward so he does the only thing he know how to do he kills a character, this time with shrapnel. How original. The appears to be the solitary way that hes capable of writing to evoke emotion. Its sad really. He used to be a great writer and now this..."

0,THIS SAW IS GARBAGE This saw DOES NOT WORK! After the first one arrived and did not work you sent us a replacement which DOES NOT WORK either. Both saws smoked and gave off an electrical smell the first time we turned them on. I couldnt tell you about the chain since we werent able to cut anything. If I had known I would not be able to return this saw something about it being hazardous material I never would have bought it on line. We have had McCulloch products for years but apparently since the company has outsourced their production the products produced are crap! Least offensive word I could think of to print online. We looked online for one since we werent able to find one in a retailer in our area. If anyone one is looking to purchase a chain saw go to Loews or Home Depot which is what we did and we are very happy with our Homelite Electric Chain Saw.

0,"Loved the Movie  HATED the DVD !!!! Shameless Advertising! First, let me say I loved the movie of Lost in Translation. Definitely a star movie. BUT, I HATED the shameless advertising on the DVD. Much to my shock, after plunking down the money here to get the DVD, I put it in my machine and it automatically starts up with streams and streams of advertising for coming attractions,etc. Hitting the Menu or Jump buttons doesnt work! Theyve disabled it in this portion of the DVD! All you can do is do a forward scan... it still takes close to  minutes to get to the movie!!! Each time you play it! This is disgusting and shameless. No one wants to pay close to  bucks for a movie and have to sit through these mandatory commercials. Ill never buy a DVD from this producer again."

0,"Punk rock? Dont think so! This is pure pop. Simple plan, Blink and Good Charolotte need to realize that Punk Rock actually died out about  years ago. First off, being punk is not about dressing at hot topic. Its a culture. Its a lifestyle. Its about being against the establishment, antigovernment and anticapitalism for some people. Its about making a statement and being a subculture against the norm. Real punks dont prance around and perform on TRL. Trust me, Ive known some before. I could sometimes call myself a punk even though i dont dress the stereotype. Trust me, Ataris is not punk. They are just poprock. Im sure they have a lot of talent but to come off as punk when theyre not is just plain wrong. The only thing CLOSEST to past punk recently is Green Day, but they still did more pop. Buy something from Green Day instead."

In fact no major engineering company I know of uses excel or office Northrup Grumman, Harris Corp, Lockheed Martin, Rockwell Collins, all use .Its really hard to believe that a company would actually remove features and capabilities from a product and then sell it as an upgrade. Isnt that fraud?"
0,"Is this Zeppelin or Spinal Tap? There is some good stuff here, particulairly the earlier performances. But Jimmy tends to solo too much and too long. And Robert Plant postures too much without any sense of humour. And we do not need  different versions of Dazed and Confused. The one great thing about this dvd is that we really see how great a musician John Paul Jones is. Brilliantly playing a variety of instruments while always staying cool. But after witnessing the plodding Knebworth performances, I thankfully remembered that The Clash had by that time already saved the true spirit of rock and roll. If you buy this dvd, you may only end up watching the first three minutes of each song."

This was wildly expensive and burned out after only a few months. When it burned out it sparked and began to melt, if I had not been there it could haveDESTROYED MY HOME or killed the people I love!DO NOT BUY. I called and asked for my money back, but they refused. They wanted me to pay to ship the broken adapter to them. It took SIX WEEKS to get a new adapter. SIX WEEKS of constant worry, frustration, and anger. No matter how many I want to talk to your supervisors I uttered it made no difference. When I finally got it they sent one that was half the value of the original!Please, do not buy this. Trust me.

0,The Aggressive Conservative Investor This book disappointed me after reading Martins letters. Although this book provides a very different angle on value investing and has some useful ideas the writing style is poor and lacks clarity. There are much better books on analysing companies I suggest Financial Statement Analysis by Martin Fridson and Fernando Alvarez.

0,"sexist voyeurism I found this anime depicts violent sex perpetrated on young girls and was only able to fast forward after the first  minutes. As I skipped through it became only more so. However I was unable to finish. I heard it has a happy ending but that seems like it would be just an artistic rationalization. I would rather have my money back and I think my exploration of Hentai is at an end.However if any one is interested in seeing a beautiful and extremely healthy depiction of Japanese School girl life and how it relates to changing mores  or recapturing dissappearing values  I strongly recommend Ghibli Studios Only Yesterday . It makes this kind of hateful work diminish in our minds and exemplifies the potential in relationships with each other and the world we live in, which we would benefit from if we aspired to. gb"

0,"Might be OK  if it worked Actually as far as a straightthrough connection it worked  but there was a fatal flaw. I could not access the configuration page, which meant I could not do the IP assignments, Port Forwarding etc necessary to actually allow it to be useful in my environment. Instead I just got an error message when I tried to access the configuration page. DLink Tech Support was a joke. They were overseas and clueless, and could think of nothing. So they said the unit must be bad, exchange it. I did  same problem. Again the Support was clueless. So I finally had to return this for a refund and am now looking elsewhere. I went on the Net and found other people with the same problem, also with no solution. Obviously, though, some people have had no problem. So if you buy it you are gambling that a it is compatible with your system or b you will never have to access the configuration page. Sorry, but that is a roulette game you shouldnt have to play. Avoid this."

0,"Too graphic and violent for me to recommend This was assigned summer reading for my th grader and fortunately, I read it first! I do not feel that such graphic desciptions of sex and violence are necessary to portray the circumstances in which Mathabane grew up. I found it a pity, actually, because the story is inspiring yet I could not get past the grapics in the first section. Needless to say, our th grader did NOT read this book. As important as it is to educate about the horrors in this world, I firmly believe that if youngsters are given this much graphic exposure we are perpetrating the crime upon their souls. Why cant writers find a way to express themselves in a higher more noble fashion? Then their important stories could be read by all. I cant believe that not one review mentioned this problem!"

Ok the beggining of the movie was promising with the modern rock sound and Keanu in Matrixlike look more fat though..But after that in  minutes or so I discovered that there was no plot..Keanu was the watcher,though he never watched just killed girls..But the biggest question occupying my mind was Why is he killing them?.The most simple answer would be because he is a psycho but he didnt show any emotions while killing,barring the possibility that this was what he was enjoying..Or maybe because he liked playing games with Spaders character,but then why he started to kill in the first place.At the end of the movie,we know as much about Keanus character as at the beginning...nothing. This was really a stupid movie and mark my words because I am a person that usually tries to find something good in action movies that most people find stupid.In this one,I found nothing.The package was good but inside was empty..."

0,"Very good, for all of three weeks The recorder was everything advertised, very versatile, good sound, userfriendly software, except that it only lasted  weeks. At this time, with no apparent reason, the LCD screen simply died. The unit was never mishandled or abused. I do not understand how a company like Sony can package such sophisticated electronics in a totally inferior, uselessly fragile, cheesy plastic chassis. I will not purchase another Sony recorder. Before this one, I owned an Olympus which took all kinds of abuse and was still going strong after  years. There is absolutely no excuse for a catastrophic failure of the LCD screen after a few days of light use."

0,"If you are Christian, this is NOT the movie for you! It seemed to me that this movie was an excuse to have softcore porn, The Apocalypse, and weird ideas about the end of the world all rolled into one...This movie takes very little from normal Christian beliefs about the Rapture, and makes a poor victim of the main character, played by Mimi Rogers. Rogers gave a good performance, but the writing was nonChristian and seemed to be somebodys bad dream written into a screenplay. I can see how some people might think it is brilliant, but I, for one, thought it was awful. The movie did not even resolve itself in a logical way. If I could have, I would have given it  stars!"
0,"Poor Performer I bought this as an upgrade to the basic software that was on my new Dell computer, and, I wanted transitional effects between tracks crossfades, fade up, etc....something the basic package wouldnt do of course. I really wished I had paid attention to the thumbs down ratings on CNET.com, because, boy were they right! Even after going to painstaking effort to assign transitions between tracks, these transitions dont neccessarily happen during recording. Further more, when you save the project to hard drive, you would think it would save the transition preferences right? WRONG! You have to go back and reinstall the transitions. I havent had this software for very long running on XP, but Im already frustrated enough to remove it from my confuser and try other software from another manufacturer. Make sure you read the opinions on this product on CNET....and take heed!!!!"
0,"Very Disappointed! Dont Waste Your Money Im a Quicken and Quickbooks user. I purchased this product with the hopes that I could save time entering receipts. What a disappointment. Yes you can download into Quickbooks but ONLY as a journal entry. I guess if thats where you put your purchases and dont use the checking or register features in QB, it might work for you. Also the dates on receipts did not capture correctly and I had to hand change them. I was also expecting a little more line item detail capture and Neat Receipts doesnt do that either. A category for sales tax is shown but you have to hand enter the sales tax. It will not capture it.If you are looking for a time saver, keep looking. This product is NOT the answer."
0,"say what? Want to feel the Vietnam experience, but are too young? No problem. This book will make you feel like youre there and back in the world. Of course, you must experience the entire scene, so heres some acid to trip on. Thats exactly what reading this book is like. You could almost hear the Doors playing in the background while reading this hallucinatory tale of madness and schizophrenia. This book definately has a womens touch, mixed with the ethearal feel of Pynchon. For a far superior straight fiction of Vietnam, Id highly recommend Michael Petersons A Time of War"

0,"This is a story of beating someone until they submiss. The title of the book has nothing to do with the content.I found the marten Trist to have skills that were not believable. This animal seemed to read minds and even sat on Hastings when Severin ordered him too. There are many examples of that in the book. The animal was cute but it took up too much of the book. I did not like the message in the book which was to dominate and suppress the women. Rape them into compliance. Beat then when they dared disobey. Continually telling them that are owned by their husbands. Hastings was tied up to the Wolfhound dog in front of the dinner table while all ate. I was shocked at the degradation. Marjorie should have recieved punishment for what she did but instead she got what she wanted. The book made me angry. I felt that it degraded women with the scenes of rape, humiliation and beatings. This is not a love story, its a sad story. I didnt hate the book, its the message it gave that I hate."

I opened one of the buckets yesterday  Dec  to my horror, most of the pellets had turned to dust. or broken up into tiny pieces. I had  pellets, and a bucket full of bits, pieces, and dust.Do not waste your money on this unless you want dust to sprinkle in the down spouts. It will be cheaper to just but the product at the Big Box stores and place it in nylon stockings.I assume the shipping movement bounced the product in the plastic bucket too many times. As they sat undisturbed in my garage sense last year."

After reading dozens of reviews describing exactly the same problems Ive had, Ill never, ever buy a Sony again. Anybody want to buy lenses and accessories for their DSCP? Call me at .

0,"ooooh burn the juggalos! this cd is so wack, its honestly not even worth it to download and bring to your friends house to laugh at it. these  guys sound like they learned to rap at the same grocery store they shop at to buy their Faygo, nail polish, and face paint. another reviewer said that punkgoth kids arent the only ones that listen to ICP. well, those are the only kids who I can think of who would listen to this crap. I mean how many people have you heard saying yeah my favorite rappers are rakim, tupac, the gza, aesop rock, grouch, shaggy  dope, and violent j ? this is pure garbage. you know it. change your ways or just deny it and hit the NOT HELPFUL button"
0,"dumb dumb dumb Stop me if youve heard this oneSo these girls go into Afghanistan, then one of the most repressive theocracies in the world. They are  get this  missionaries, and they wander around trying to convert the heathens to Christianity, which is a little like opening a synagogue in s Germany. It would make a good sitcom, in the tasteless manner of Hogans Heroes, but it makes a lousy book. Religious zealotry is the worst thing on the planet and these two crullers merely wanted to exchange one type of fanaticism for another."
0,"Horrible I ended up watching the show. At first I liked the guys because they were trying to live their dreams but as time went on I got down right sick of their spoiled brat behavior. If thats not enough, they cant sing worth beans. Their voices on this CD is obviously studio created. If youve seen the show youd know. Every time they sang I had to mute my television. I am not at ALL a fan of boybands but if youre going to buy one get quality like Backstreet Boys or Nsync. Please. They got these guys off the street to prove one thing. Anybody can be a star. Dont prove them right. It cheapens the entire music industry for those who have real talent."
0,"Slaughter Of The DVD Retromedia dropped the ball on this one. I have the Monterey Video release...and while even that is missing some  mins of footage due to damage of the reels or so they say, This version is sharp, clear and complete.Retro did include a titular jog by Graziella Granata that is not available in the Monterey version but is memorable at best but they just totally did a real hatchet job on the editing of their DVD version. I have seen the MV version several times over the last  years and one viewing of the DVD by Retromedia told me that I wasted .. I will trade this one in in a heartbeat if Dark Sky Films does it much better."
0,"Not far so lovable as the DisneyMovie What a boring book. First I saw the DisneyMovie from ... those lovable figures, like the brave Alice, the crazy Chesire Cat, the big red Queen and her tiny little king, the wild expressive story. Great. Then the remake or second part of the story with the extraordinary Jonny Depp. But nothing of these great pieces you can find in this book.The only good thing in this book is the crazy story, about a girl in her wonderland with the insane inhabitants.It was a dull writing. Sentences like He said... Then she said... Then he said... will make you lazy. There is no heart in the story... just a pure and clean describing of the chapters of this story. But what makes a book a good book? Its the describtion of all the surroundings, like how the weather was, what temper the figures have, all the nonrelevant things you want to know. You cant find them in this book. My recommandation Take another book."
0,"Wacko. The concepts presented in this book are wacko. Recapitulation theory is bunk just do a google search for ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny, the books main tenent, and you will see, and the book is completely based on this baseless theory.Speaking to your toddler in short phrases that she can understand? That should be a no brainer. Why this is a revelation to people I cannot understand. Speaking to your toddler as if you are a caveman? That is crazy. I refuse to act like a primitive version of a human in the grocery store instead of modeling appropriate behavior for my child.Any book will have nuggets of wisdom. This one has very few, and ferreting them out is not worth your time, money, or attention."

0,Not up to scratch I agree...its completely lame for the author to review his own book. Looking things over including the authors site its clear that he may have the technical skills but has terrible design skills. Check out his site for a demo of his work as he suggests...This book would be a waste of your time and money.

0,"Very Interesting ... At the present time I am studying Physics at A level, which,although it helped me to understand a lot of what was going on in thebook it was nontheless a bit confusing in places, especially, I found,in the last three chapters. Although Steven Hawking has indeed cutout an incrediable ammount of the jargon in this book it is still anadvantage to know at least the basics of Physics and of physicsrelated subjects, if you dont you will find this book a bit of a hardread. However, this is a very intresting book and I definatly recomendit to anyone studying physics at any level It has certainly helped mein my studies This book is generally good reading for all but is abit tough in places. Especially useful to anyone studying physics."
0,"AN OUTDATED PIECE OF JUNK USELESS FOR ACADEMICS This edition is ancient, still containing an errata page, and with none of the scholarly apparatus including line numbers and notes from Gdel and God knows what else. It is utterly useless for looking up French quotations found in articles with no way to compare this translation to the French original. And it gives far too much deference to Jacques Derrida whose understanding of Saussure is poor. Can anyone suggest a better English version to get and which French version has the most scholarly apparatus? There seem to be two or three dozen different French editions."

As good looking as Johnny is, that cant carry this movie. Sorry I bought it as I could have watched it for free on Comcast On Demand"
0,Tanog dancers beware! This book is basically unreadable. I tried several times to wade through it and eventually gave up. I am sure there are some valuable points here but they are under deep layers of academic self indulgence. Tango dancers beware! This book is more about political theory than the dance.
0,Horrible! This is the second order of the same thing. When I spoke to Amazon CSR regarding the first order not having the earrings in the box they refunded my money.

0,"Not a good book this book is totally innappropriate for elementary children. It seems to only address anger issues, not stress issues. Not every child gets angry when they are stressed. Some are sad, nervous, or scared. A waste of my money. It is a workbook for a middle school or high school student to do on their own."
0,Much too harsh and rigid I gave this  stars because it does have valid information about sleep. But all sleep books seem to agree on the basic principles. I abhor the insensitive way that solutions are arrived at. Letting a baby cry alone ..to train him to sleep is simply wrong. Our children rely on us for comfort and security and we should accept that role. This also isnt a quick fix my friend has been using it for about a year and her child still cries to sleep. I much prefer the more kind and loving methods in The No Cry Sleep Solution which also covers the basics but lays out many ideas for getting sleep without the rigid let them cry ideas found here.

0,"Audiotron  No Support Dont buy an audiotron. It wont play albums in track order, but only in alphabetical order. Not a great feature when youre trying to listen to a symphony or opera or any other musical piece where track order matters. The company does not provide any telephone technical support. They claim to provide hour internet and fax support, but I sent two emails and a fax and I never received a response. The online troubleshooting database is also a joke. It is clear that the company has known about this problem for  years, but has not provided a solution yet.

0,Watch No Country For Old Men instead For those of you that watch about any movie that comes out this movie will be just fine.If youre a little more picky about how you spend a couple hours of your night I would skip this movies. The director seems concerned with style more than substance. Either than or the director knew the cast he had to work with wasnt going to be able to deliver so he had to use other methods to keep the viewers interest. There are multiple sections of the movie where a song is playing as you watch the character sit there or do mundane items. Probably highart to some but it came across a way to sell the soundtrack.  part No Country For Old Men  Part Boogie Nights  Part Forrest Gump the long music sections  Part s drive in movie

However, after reading this one, I dont want to read anything else by this author. This was one of the biggest wastes of time I have ever read. The only reason I finished it was to find out who did it. Well, guess what? She Tartt didnt even give me that satisfaction.The first couple of long chapters were good and interesting. It was downhill from there. Tartt bogged us down in detailed descriptions of things that had nothing to do with the plot. I literally skimmed and skipped through entire pages!Do NOT waste your money on this book!"

0,"Moore hates america and freedom. Micheal Moore made me vomit while watching this movie. America would be a better place if he left here, which he should because he obviously doesnt appreciate everything that his country does for him.

0,"Lane  Solid Swimsuit I was unhappy with the suit because it did not provide any type of coverage for serious swimming. If you look at the picture, youll notice that the model has a rather flat backside and a flat chest. I think if you are even slightly more endowed than the model, the suit will not provide adequate coverage for your top and backside.I returned the suit, and was amazed with the customer service from Lane . I was credited with my refund less than  hours after putting the suit in the mail. I would definitely do business with them again, but I would review the item I was purchasing very carefully before I purchased it."

0,"Morbidly Entertaining, But a Bad Influence... Im sure the title of this book will attract countless impressionable teens and young adults and thereby should have a warning label on it NOT FOR YOUNG TEENS.Although it was wellwritten and yes, morbidly entertaining, Im worried that it will negatively influence young minds. I dont mean to sound prissy, but Im the mother of two adult daughters and I wouldnt even want them reading this book. The characters habits of heavy drinking, random violence, smoking cigarettes and marijuana, promiscuous sex and cutting are presented in a way that makes you want to emulate them.There doesnt seem to be a problem the bitch posse encounters that cant be soothed with one of the above bad habits, not to mention snorting cocaine.I believe the author tries to redeem her characters at the end, but its much too little, much too late for this reader."

0,"Construction notes to build a Tesla Coil I have reviewed this book when I first started gathering information on Tesla coil design. Much of the information can be obtained from old reprints and other sources. George has described building a Tesla coil using househould appartatus such as Tupperware containers. If you are serious about Tesla coil construction, then this manual is probably not for you. If you want a basic understanding of the Tesla coil, this manual is reasonably priced and can rest in your bookcase along with more advanced books on the subject.Again, this is one mans design and is probably not the most effecient coil you can build to give you the longest sparks, but it is a start to provide for a beginner. When I built my Tesla coil, I did not use the design information in this manual."

0,"Knight Errant in more ways than one! After reading this book because it was written in the tradition of Diana Gabaldons Outlander series, I am vastly disappointed. As an avid reader of historical fiction, this one was just silly. The heroine in this book was mindless, aimlessly babbeling on to anyone with no consequences as to how she may be perceived. Being accustomed to a lot of details in historical fiction, there was a lot missing from this book. Pairing actual persons to fictional ones is tricky when its done well, but missed the mark here. Im sad to say I wasted my money on the hardback book."

The box claims that there are  piecesaround half of these pieces are cheap little clumps of Chinese plastic that are supposed to be Cowboys and Indians but are hardly recognizable. As for the logs themselves, they are adequate, but the groove cuts are not consistent the pieces do not hold together firmly and hence the built structure is quite flimsy. There are only  longer piecesfor the base and the roofso your entire structure has to consist of doors and windows. There is essentially only one kind of house you can build with so few pieceslittle room for creativity. A big disappointment."

Yes, the figures are as usual awesome, but the moving parts the ferris wheel and roller coaster fall apart and are confusing for small minds to grasp. P.S.

0,"Its pretty but it cant fight Im on my second season of using the yardbug and, other than its sleek style and compact design, there is not much good to say about it. The bagging and mulching capabilities are marginal  it tends to leave large grass clippings when mulching and does not give a clean sweep when bagging. Maintenance and adjustments are difficult to perform. To change the oil requires attaching a chute that can lead to a mess. Even leveling the blade is a complicated task. Most disappointing is the cutting capabilities. Cutting tends to be uneven and I often find the mower scaulps the grass when there is any uneveness to the surface. I find the mower to be unstable when mowing on an incline and the safety features are agravating."

More than  feet from the home base and I would get a connecting message and the person I was talking to would get cut off. I liked the sleek design, but apparently it needs and antennae."
0,"Not what i expected from paramount pictures!! If your a true trekie you will still like this film im sure, but this movie doesnt live up to the movie before this one First Contact, but in general it is a good movie, it has its ups and downs, i was hoping to see more of the enterprise E in action but im sure in time we will all get to see more of it, i hope. If you consider yourself a true star trek fan then do your self a favor and buy it now!!!"
0,"Service after the sale? I purchased this shaver and was very satisfied with the shave and the selfcleaning feature. The problem arose when the self cleaning mechanism failed and I tried to get service! I mailed it off meticulously following instructions. It was returned some weeks later  not fixed!! I called a number of places and finally found someone from Gillete which takes care of this product. The clerk told me that a replacement would be on the way. If someone could help me find out the status of that mailing I would appreciate it. In sum, great product. Great brand  unless it breaks. Buyer beware."
0,Barbie Fashion Show Review I am unable to provide a review since the game was so outdated it could not be downloaded and the tech support no longer existed! The game was useless and was thrown away just like my money. I believe the seller knew the game was outdated and useless. Shame on you! My child was very upset and disappointed. My lesson...buyer beware of internet sales!
0,Confused Buyers I bougth this print pack assuming that it will work on my ex. Its out of stock last year and this was the one put on the site instead. I still had this opened package which I found out would not work on my printer. I wish amazon would make it clearer to buyers so that we can order the right print pack and dont get confused. Im really dissatisfied with this purchase.JJB
0,"Get a real tiller, Mantis never worked for me Purchased the tiller under the impression that it would be great. All the advertising on TV and in magazines, etc.Delivered to home promptly, put it together and it took about an hour and  minutes to get it started. Once started it ran sluggish. After a few minutes turned it off and it has never started again. Emails to Mantis seem to fall off the world as no response.So I went out and purchased a large  hp front tine tiller and it starts first time every time. Does a great job compared to the Mantis, seeing I can not get the Mantis to even run.I am not going to drag the mantis all over town to get it fixed, that is just plain nuts. Not going to send it back, as I do not see much in track record of Mantis happy repairs for customers. Looks like Ive been had.Just to let you know about my mantis experience."
0,"bibles are for believers To be fair, I did not read this pagetopage, but spent a few hours poring over it along with a few other books on Filemaker Pro in the bookstore.Unfortunately I have yet to find a book on Filemaker that goes significantly beyond the manual to explain and exemplify some of the more powerful features of Filemaker, say, the calculation fields and scripting. Im a regular observer of the Filemaker forums online and can understand why they are so popular.I agree with the first reviewer that the book should not simply target beginners, as Filemaker is simple enough already to waste time on intuitive tasks.This for the true bibliophile."
0,"Not so good ... Ive listened to this album many times, and just cant get into it. Its very generic, and sounds like everything else nowadays on the radio.

0,"Roy Lessin should be imprisoned This book is sick there is ABSOLUTELY no reason why this book should be in print. Its an excuse and a guide to parents wanting to perform child abuse. The mental damage that discipline of this kind cause are life changing, life changing in a bad way, not creating a happy and obedient child. Amazon should be ashamed to sell such ridiculous parenting filth.I wish there was a zero stars option."

0,"Tiny cans I ruined a can of this soup because I added water  milk to it.Now why did you do that???Because these cans are actually smaller than the cans of condensed cream of mushroom soup made by Campbells.. oz compared to . oz for the condensed soup. . or so for the regular soup.So I never thought twice about adding water  milk because of the small size of this can. Shouldve read the label, I know.Anyways, youd have to open  of these tiny cans to equal the amount of soup that you get in a regular can of cream of mushroom soup.At this price, Ill never find out if this low sodium version really tastes as good as the mg of sodium version. But judging by the fact that I had to mail order that can since none of the stores in my neighborhood here in Los Angeles is carrying this particular low sodium soup, I doubt it."
0,"This book does not achieve mediocrity This book is worse than average on the topic of branding, which is a topic that is over covered and generally not well covered.Mr. DAlessandro slanders advertising agencies as never caring about the brand or results but rather just sychophantically coveting a revenue stream. This statement is a breathtaking combination of ignorance and stupidity. Obviously an agency cannot survive without the ability to deliver results. The market makes sure of that.Dont buy this book for three reasons. It offers nothing new. It should have been an article not a book. It has very little content of substance.. It is often wrong in its conclusions, such as the importance of entertainment and emotion in advertising.The book is a hodgepodge of capricious anecdotes with little information for a serious student of branding to learn from."
0,"This guy is Pathetic This book is like the blind trying to lead the seeing. Mature Christians who read this book cannot fail to see through this young boys agenda. Sadly, this is the genre of socalled Christian books that has become popular in recent years. The authors portray themselves as the disillusioned sinner or rebel without a cause who finally comes to realize that Jesus actually loves them. They realize this despite the hateful treatment they have received from all the Christian hypocrites. Because of their new and superior understanding of grace, they are now in the position to enlighten us and to judge all the selfrighteous hypocrites who comprise the church. Don Miller observed this formula for a succesful Christian book, applied it, and sold a lot of books. It is that simple. As far as Christianity goes, Miller is ignorant."
0,"Horrible, Awful, Terrible, Torturous and Talent less I was excited about the new modern look and sound. Everything was right, then Judas began singing Heaven on their minds and it was downhill from then on. He sounded like Bono with an even bigger whine. Jesus could not be any more bland than a cardboard sandwich.Norman Jewison knows how to portray passion, love and agony and knows how to find the people with the talent to perform those emotions. Go get the Jewison version. This is a total waste of time!!!"
0,"These are Some Messed Up Rhymes Im shocked to see that these books are still selling today. I had this exact book when I was little, and my mother brought the old copy to me cause she thought my daughter might like to have it. I dont think Im going to bother giving it to her. I was frightened by this book when I was little. Mother Goose looks more like a wicked witch, stealing a baby, on the cover. There are tons of nursery rhymes, but most of them are very obscure, some only a couple lines long. And maybe I am reading too much into them, but a lot of them seem full of sexual innuendo and possible drug references. One titled Robin and Richard seems the most questionable, about two grown men staying in bed until  oclock. Im not prejudiced at all, but this seems like a very strange rhyme for children to be reading. Everything about this book is disturbing to me."
0,"THE SELLER IS A NUTCASE! I was sent the wrong doll and was very disappointed. I contacted the seller and he became verbally abusive, he called me several times yelling and acting crazy.

0,"WHAT EVER HAPPENED??? This book is not even close to the quality that Ms. Cornwell usually writes in. What in the world happened? The stories were all disjointed and hard to follow. Most of all, I just couldnt get to know the characters too well. In her Scarpetta books, Ms Cornwell really lets you get to know her characters well and admire them. But I couldnt get to like Hammer at all. To me the writing just kept on jumping from one thing to the other that there wasnt enough time to get to know her. I also think that the way West and Brazil were presented was superficial as well.My recommendation AVOID THIS BOOK! This is Ms. Cornwells worst book yet.Hopefully her next one will be better."
0,"I am oppressed by horrible literature. This book was the most painfully terrible book that I have ever had the displeasure to have seep into my oppressed mind. The characters are delusional. I mean, if a guy thinks that once upon a time, he was a dragon, he is most likely mentally impaired. This book should sooner be chosen for torture purposes in gulags or concentration camps than in a th grade english class. If you are interested in purchasing this book, I suggest that you refrain from reading it, and use it as a firestarter instead."
0,"Not what I expected I thought this witchcraft movie was very boring, most of these series I have seen are pretty good but not this one. Of course I read the review from others before I bought it and should have taken heed to them. I wanted to see this first series because I had never seen it. The only thing I got out of it was how Will Spanner came about. He is the main character in other witchcraft series. I would not had lost much by not seeing this film but I did get to see how it all started."
0,Not Very Well Made I have had this set for a few years. After about  months the bottom split in three places. The top has now developed a split also. I am very disappointed because I like the size and everything else about it. Buyer beware!
0,"Boring and confusing book. Do no waste your money on this one. I am a collector of any books on Princess Diana and have read them all. In my opinion this book is terrible. The author is using the guise of writing about Princess Diana to bash Paul Burrell, President Bush and Tony Blair and the Iraq war. He begins to tell you something about Princess Diana then the next thing you know he is off on a tanget about something else. This is a very boring and confusing book. It isnt interesting enough to keep the readers mind alert."

0,"Alpha Dog Unwatchable If you are an adult with brain cells Alpha Dog will be unwatchable. I had to turn it off after torturing through  minutes of watching adolescent males posturing with grotesque levels of ignorance. If there was action, suspense, plot, any shred of meaningful dialogue, I may have been able to watch the entire film. But who wants to pay money, and waste two hours, watching a room full of partying teens act stupidly? The characters are so painfully dumb it is torture to watch. The world of the uneducated and brash American teen age boy is not one I want to go to. Maybe there is a social message or commentary by the end of the film, but if you value your time and intelligence pass on this worthless peek into the world of drugged out teens"
0,Boring We found this movie boring and confusing. It was difficult to tell who was what and frankly my dear I did not give a damn. The best part was the end when everybody got shot. It would have been a better movie if those scenes had taken place in the begining and I didnt have to watch the rest of it.

0,"the worst blindside album of all i love the first release that blindside had put out, so i had highly anticipated the release of a thought crushed my mind. Its sad to say that i was totally let down. This is one of the worst cds ever released by any band. The boys from blindside take a stab at hardcore and its a disgrace to a good genre. This cd says to me, Were trying really hard to be a hardcore band but dont know how. To me it sounds like a buch of noise, not music. If you like choatic music, get system of a down, not this cd. If you just like blindside pick up there other releases but stay away from this one."

Sounded like a teenage garage band.Big Dud for me.BC"

0,Should have negative  star rating! This is the worse product ever! When I bought it I figured it was the same as what I get from my vet as I forgot the name but absolutely not! I put it on one of my  cats and she instantly starting itching the area and trying everything she could to get it off of her. She started running from me and was so obviously miserable. She was itching so bad her fur was getting scratched off. That was yesterday and I have washed the area  times now. It finally looks better but a small amount of residue is still on her. I feel so bad as she went through H and know now to just wait until a weekday and get these kinds of products from my trusty vet. The rest of it is in the garbage and believe this company should not be allowed to sell this poison. Ive learned a lot and care about my pets too much to go the cheap route ever again.

0,"Nothing new or original Geez. Is there a woman alive in a romance novel anywhere that doesnt go from the rat to the love of her life? How predictable. How boring.And hey, I live in this neck of the woods and I never quite bought the descriptions of this area. It was too generic or too wooded or something. It just wasnt real.But then nothing in this book really is. The characters, the settings, the plot itself are all just superficial plastic stuff youve read about before.If a typical romance novel done up in Pacific Northwest flannel is all youre in the mood for, this is your book. But dont look for anything more than a flavored coffee moment."
0,"What was all the hype? Once again, the Oscar hype has taken a subpar film, and rocketed it to popularity and success on the backs of two of todays best actors. Kevin Spacey once again delivers an awardworthy performance, and Annette Benning is superb as his emotionally eratic wife, but thats where the kudos should end. Not since The English Patient has a film been so disappointing and unworthy of all the attention and praise it has received. This dark, tragic tale of midlife crisis fails to deliver and plods along with teasers of a climactic finish, only to finish the same way it began....slow. Look for a great performance by Kevin Spacey, as always, but your time and money would be better spent on any other of his movies. The Usual Suspects is a perfect example. Steer clear of this one unless you believe all the hype and irrationality once again shown by the Academy"
0,"Horrific This is by far, the most ridiculous attempt at a book I have ever encountered. It staggers the mind to consider that the author made any effort to write it, and on top of that, that it was actually published.The book is composed like a th grade book report shallow to the point that you wonder if the author spent as much time writing it as you did reading it, immature in both content and style, and generally pointless. The concept of sexual addiction is far more profound than either Zanes unlikeable character, Zoe, or her exploration of it which never manages to rise above the sea of vulgarity and graphic descriptions of the act itself.This is the sort of book for people who believe that anyone who can read can write."

0,"Do not buy this book for your child!!! I am a teacher. I loved allof the Harry Potter books and was told that this was a similar series. Wrong. This book is awful. It is about three orphans who are physically  psychologically abused by their caretaker. It also dumbsdown the vocabulary, by explaining what each word means in the text of the story as if you are reading a dictionary. I couldnt even finish it and I dont say that about many childrens books."
0,waste of money This was a horrible movie Cameron Diaz cant act for the life of her. As for Tom Cruse this was a horrible attempt of him to try to show producers and directors that he can still run around at his age. He must have been desperate to do this role in hopes of other roles in movies. The whole idea of this movie running around killing people was so lame and boring. You knew what was going to happen threw out the entire movie. Many parts were so rediculous and stupid.All in all the movie was not worth watchingthe highlight was went it finally ended.

0,"Worthless This product has been absolutley worthless for me for measuring wind speed from the day I got it. I have very strong winds, probably about   mph fairly regularly and the anemomter will never show anything over . mph. It is very frustrating because I stand outside in the cold to get a reading and it will only show single digit readings. I even sent it back to the manufacturer for repairs shortly after receiving it and it came back exactly the same. I think its worthless for wind speeds, but I can get temperature readings from it."
0,"Juvenile I read this book at the suggestion of a friend. I am not a Fantasy fan, though I did read the entire Tolkien trilogy and got involved enough to learn how to write Quenyan in college. Comparatively, Eye of the World is thin, it just looks thick. There is no actual development in plot or characters, just a very long chase scene over many, many chapters. It would be more aptly titled How to Take a Simple Plot Idea and Make it Last for  Pages. Though, to be fair, if one is young in the world, it probably would be an entertaining read. But Im afraid that once one hits hisher late twenties, life hardens ones tolerance for such fluff."
0,"I regret buying this for my girlfriend I bought this book because my gf loves oprah and usually wants to read the books she comes out with on her book club if she hasnt already. She found the book ok before the word got out about the authors lies. I read a few chapters while sitting on the can and like many others, did not understand what all the hype was about. The book is not a terrible read, but certainly not the best thing youll ever read. I stopped reading after I found out that he lied and in the process, make himself a multimillionaire, and what seemed like a soso account of drug addiction was shown to be an egocentric build up of a man who thought too much of himself. Dont support this guy, he doesnt need anymore money."

0,"A Bit Disappointed As a lover of horror movies, I purchased this movie expecting more and expecting gore. Although some scenes were cool, overall this movie was boring at times and there was poor acting. College students are asked to put together a mannequin which they called Jigsaw.

Then I learned that this is an Epson problem.I will be calling tech support again on Monday. This saga has been ongoing since May. Its July.

0,"Weak As a good and true Catholic, I believe in the reality of demonic possession and in the authority and power of the Church to exorcise demons from those people they plague and torment. Having said that, however, Im disappointed in the books Ive read on exorcism. Putting myself in the shoes of a skeptic, I know how uncomfortable, embarrassed, and unpersuaded Id be by these efforts. Father Amorths book is no exception. Granted, it may be partly the fault of the amateurish writing or the translation, but the good Father comes across as, well, rather silly. Im sure hes not, but thats the impression with which Im left.Furthermore, Father Amorth is clearly an adherent of the charismatic movement within the Catholic Church. In the interests of full disclosure, I must say that this movement is not at all my cup of tea I consider it far more Protestant than Catholic.Not recommended."

0,"A little weak, but good. I got this book used. The author writes with wit and charm. The plot...well, it was a bit weak. Why would a witch in Texas be working for the British government, would not the USA government have made more sense? And why is a  page paperback .? Even with a discount at Amazon it is over  bucks, hat is why I brought it used, and I am so glad. It is a nice light read, with charm and wit. Even with the minor plot flaw I enjoyed it and would have rated it higher but it just is not worth the price.

0,"just plain bad!!! I can not believe this carries the National Lampoons name, and can be associated with Animal House and Vacation. This movie was just plain bad, did not flow well, poor acting, and paris hilton and the other gals of Gamma Gamma were hideous twigs with thick make up, poor teeth from vomiting, and bags under their eyes from hangovers. Paris played herself, a spoiled rich girl, but what could one expect. For as highly advertised as this was, big let down. There were a few amusing spots, but the rest could be watched in fast forward. Let this one rot."
0,"Flat Live Recordings I had high expectations for this release, yet was disappointed in the live recordings for two reasonsThe removal of the crowd noise left a glaring hole in the recording and the choice to fade in and out for each track.Any live recording should hope to capture the excitement of actually being at the concert, and this recording fails to do that. It gives the listener the feeling that were only getting a portion of the performance.The new tracks are enjoyable, but not enough to carry the entire album. Hollywood Records would have been better to remaster the original, or give us an entire live performance from beginning to end."

Im sure the smell factor will worsen now, so, trying to decide with another baby on the way if well buy yet another one of these or go with a different pail that requires expensive bags???"
0,"Rather too cute Too much a vehicle for Paltrow, and too little a vehicle for Austen. The Beckinsale AE version is much better, and Im not sure that the BBC version was not the best  I cannot decide. But this one is superficial and unsatisfying. Too vague a Jane Fairfax, while Frank Churchill is sometimes too flashy and sometimes too dull and lumpish, while the relationship between these two is undeveloped. Miss Taylor is too young and foolish, and Mr. Knightley looks still wet behind the ears  no match for his Emma. Emma is too pretty and Harriet not pretty enough, the hypochondriac father, so richly and amusingly portrayed in both the other versions, is just thrown away here, while the Harriet Smith character is rather wooden and the HarrietEmma relationship lacks most of the humor Austen wickedly portrayed in it  which the other two versions bring out very well. I will say, I do like the portrayal here of one of Austens prize jerks  the ineffable Mrs. Elton."
0,"Good for newborns or small babies only I thought this product was great when my son was a newborn born  pounds,  ounces but by the time he was two months old this carrier couldnt handle the load. The other thing I didnt like was that it was not easy to put him into or take out of the carrier  he would scream and scream until I got him settled. If you have a smaller baby you could probably get a lot more use out of it, as I did enjoy it a great deal for those few weeks I was able to use it  but if you have a bigger baby I personally dont think it is worth the price."
0,"Poor at best Karen Longs book is, well, disappointing. It reads as a poorly organized selfpromotion. She never fails to remind the reader that she is a formerhard hitting journalist, or drop names of celebrities she has known. The selfkudos are unending.I dont know whose fault it is but Karen should contemplate killing her editor, not her husband. The book is disjointed chronologically, and the only useful advice comes from a chapter that summerizes what her pastor taught her. Id rather read his book.Ultimately this book is sometimes funny but mostly poorly written, filled with selfpromotion rather than practical steps for fixing a broken marriage. Most reviews read like sychophantic kissups, like they know the author and cant say anything constructive.If you have a marriage that is actually difficult find something else, youre wasting your time here."
0,Disappointed I was so disappointed in Theresa Sokyrkas First Album these old charms. I was looking forward in her audition song Gob Bless the Child and purchased this CD just to hear her sing like she sang it in her audition. What a let down. Theresa decided to play it safe on this CD and did not let loose. No emotions. Just another voice and bland at that.

0,"The yellow box is worthless. All a water level is, is a clear plastic tube with something to close off the air at both ends  you have to remove them to get the level but it keeps the water from leaking out of the tube, or air bubbles from getting in, when youre shlepping it around.Zircon added a totally unnecessary idiot box light  buzzer to help you find the level and thereby jack up the cost of this gizmo. I couldnt get it to work with the yellow box, eventually got frustrated and removed it. The tubing by itself and water once you get the bubbles out of it worked great thereafter. Bottom line do not waste your  on this thing. Go down to Home Depot, buy  of  clear vinyl tubing, clamp off the ends with a couple of those black springy binder clips from your office, and add a little food coloring to the water to make it more visible. Five bucks tops if you steal the clips from work."
0,"Not the best Snyders of Hanover Pretzels Snyders of Hanover makes good pretzels Honey Mustard  Onion is my favorite, but these are just not appetizing at all. Hot Buffalo Wing gets its kick from dried cayenne pepper sauce. So if you are a fan of peppers you might like this pretzel. They are nowhere near as good as Honey Mustard in my opinion, though they arent as bad as just cheddar cheese. Hot Buffalo seems to be enhanced by eating them with other food, in my case, chocolate MMs. If you like a spicy zing, try these pretzels, they are not horrible. If you like sweetness just stick to Honey Mustard  Onion. Nutritionwise, are not the best as they contain MSG and caramel color. Also, if you consumed an entire  oz. bag in one sitting, you would be consuming  calories. I guess their good if you are trying to gain weight like I am trying to do. Otherwise stick to the healthier counterpart of the unflavored ones."

0,Watch Keaton roll in his grave This late Keaton material  when the actor desperately needed funds  is so asinine and unoriginal you will writhe along with Keaton rolling in his grave at this release.The cover art was so deceptive that I bought into the DVD collection being some obscure works from the silent era. Nope. The producers of this release went to painstaking steps to conceal the nature of this material. It comes from Keatons last gasp on the screen skits so insanely stupid you will pity both Keaton and yourself for buying this crap.

0,"Warning! Book is the size of a cookie Maybe I missed it somewhere in the description, but I didnt realize this was a minibook about the size of a chocolate chip cookie. The story is too juvenile for my niece who can read and is into anything small and the small print, lots of text and tiny pictures dont work for my four year old."
0,Not for me The writing seemed directed toward a juvenile audience. Too much like a daytime soap opera and not enough substance. The daily crisis approach instead of a welldeveloped story overtook a promising start. The main character had so many flaws I couldnt stand her by the end of the book.

0,"A lot of fluff. I bought this set for my Mom who is a big Beatles fan and she really wasnt impressed. Theres a lot of memorabilia type stuff, but she said the movie really isnt very good, and shed much rather just listen to the music than watch the movie or read the song notes, or look at pictures of them. If youre big into collectibles, and memorabilia, this is definitely for you, just wasnt for my Mom, and I wasnt too impressed either."

0,"Dud I just bought this toy. I have  yr old and  yr old boys. This toy is loud, but not as loud as some of the reviews would leave you to believe. Still, better as an outside toy. The toy fires by putting no more than three balls in the chute and cranking up the drive wheel. When you get the wheel up to a decent RPM you can pull the trigger and the ball shoots out in a semiautomatic way you can rapid fire up all three balls. The problem is that the wheel looses RPM very quickly and by the time you get to the second and third ball it barely goes  feet. If the RPM drops too low the ball will become jammed in the barrel, causing a problem that only an adult will be able to fix with the help of something long enough to poke down the barrel to pop the ball out.Overall fun value is low due to the noise and the quick loss of RPM. My boys got bored with it quickly. Regular neff dart guns are much much better."

I wasnt familiar with her music before purchasing this CD, other than a snippet I heard on the radio, much edgier than anything here.

0,"In good conscience, how could you sell this book? I am a shocked that any one in good conscience could actually sell a text book with pages torn out of the book. I spent . dollars of my hard earned money to receive a book that i really cant use. Is there no quality control? I ordered through Amazon because my experience in the past has been good. I will be more hesitant the next time. Further more, I really would like my money back and a text book that is usable.I am giving Amazon  star, as the turn around time in receiving the book was good."
0,"Shoddy construction Ive already gone through two pairs of these and I dont think I will go for a third. The first pair died on the first day I wore them, when I stepped on the right earbud. My second pair lasted a little longer, but I had the same problem as many others  something went loose near the plug connector which caused the right earbud to stop working completely.I like the lanyard design which positions the microphone in a good location when worn correctly, and the button is easily findable and pushable. But the sound quality of the earphones when they work at all is not great and the earbuds are a little uncomfortable when compared to the VModas."

0,"Endless and useless Ok, so Ill say it. I hated the movie Gone with the Wind. But, in an effort to be fair, I decided to read the book. I thought maybe it was something about the production that I didnt like. But, no, the book has many of the same problems.Reasons to Hate GWTWIts endless for one, just like the movie. Over a thousand pages and a large bit of it is completely unecessary. Rhett  I dont care what anyone says, he wasnt handsome, he wasnt romantic, and there wasnt much to like about him. Scarlett  Ive never seen a more annoying female lead. And everyone says, oh she grows up in the end! she stops being selfish! She doesnt. If you dont like the two main characters, whats the point?Needless to say, it was a waste of money for me and I gave my copy to a friend who loves the movie. At least shell enjoy it."
0,"Not enough Susanna Hoffs Doll Revolution has one major flaw. Only a few of the songs showcase Susanna Hoffs on lead vocals. I love to hear her sing. If you purchase this album and enjoy Hoffs voice, youll be left wanting more. While I applaud the idea of trying something new, it didnt work here. The Bangles need Hoffs on lead vocals. Its just that simple."

0,"Very Disappointing My mother has narcisstistichistrionic personality disorder, an intensely pathological condition far more destructive than the type of narcissists this book addresses. I already knew much of what was in the book, in terms of identifying a narcissist no doubt in her case, as she had been diagnosed by multiple therpists. The impacts of having a parent with Narcissistic Personality Disorder NPD are similar to what is described in the book again, no news for me but the suggestions for recovery are too basic and simplistic for someone with a parent with NPD. I did not find at all the relief I hoped for in reading about others who had experienced what I had gone through."
0,"Hot Tranny Mess!!! I have not one pleasant to say about this film. My list of bad attributes could go on forever so ill try to make it quick.The acting was laughably bad, not one person, attempting to portray a character, was close to being believable.Also... had the budget been any less for this terrible flick, it would have looked like it was filmed with a childs toy camera.Lastly, the plot was so confusing and choppy, it couldnt be salvaged by the best of Hollywoods directors. The first hour and  min into the film were intolerably boring and the last ten minutes were lacking any special effects. As Marys ghost attacks  characters she is invisible to the human eye so there they are throwing themselves about ridiculously.I cant believe I watched this all the way through."
0,"This is the last time Ill buy refurbished This vacuum doesnt suck. It worked okay for awhile, but soon lost suction and now is the equivalent to a  lb dustbuster, but too unwieldy to use like a dustbuster so, overall, its pretty much useless.

0,"Poor design There is virtually no clearance for the wheels to turn. It just skids across the floor and never pops. To add insult to injury, the axle was slightly bent which further prevented the wheels from turning and activating the popper.

0,"A bunch of leftwing drivel I stuck with Bill Clinton because he was my friend. Thats all Mr. Carville had to say. But no, he had to write a long, leftwing diatribe against Bill Clintons political adversaries, and for good measure, take a gratuitous swipe at ol Joe McCarthy and crossreference him and the current Republican Congress with Hitler. This book was long, drawnout and chock full of sacrifices on the altar of the Democratic Party. And he calls the Republicans ideologues. Talk about the stove and the freaking kettle. I cannot recommend this book to anyone interested in the Clinton impeachment of . I would hardly consider the chief spinmaster of the Clinton Administration to be an objective source for anything but the Clinton Administrations arrogance of power.Theodore Roosevelt said that the average citizen owed the President loyalty insofar as the President showed loyalty to the Constitution and the United States.

0,"Horrible Engineering, Design, and Execution What a complete waste of money. This is a poorly designed clamping miter gauge, with enough play in each of the assembled parts to render it all but useless. It is sensitive to any contact with anything to the point of being unusable. The parts are very low quality, they dont fit together well, and actually using the clamp its salient feature causes the miter angle to change by as much as three degrees.Save your money. The only thing worthwhile about this utter piece of garbage is the bar that goes in the miter slot on your table saw. That can be salvaged and attached to a jig.Simply horrible."

They were on top of the rock world. Hard as they came. Then follow the leader, which started to lose its touch then the rest off the Bull. This greatest hits is a lie. These are a bunch of terrible songs untill the end of the cd. Blind, twist, clown, and trash are the only good songs on here. I cant believe they would name this greatest hits, what a dissapointment. My korn days are over folks."
0,"Nice general guide but little else I purchased this book online while doing a massive repair job on a series of Engineering Manuals that were filled with writing errors and confusing information. This book is more like a handy dandy thesaurus but for real technical writing, it is virtually uselesss. The Microsoft Word Help Index has better examples. I found it to be confusing and actually a bit disorganized with tons of info that most people past English  should know, especially Technical Writers or those who describe themselves as being so. I dont recommend it."

0,"Grandmas Guide Ok, I picked up this book, thinking, Girlfriends Guide to Pregnancy. This should be a current, hip book about being pregnant! I am disappointed to report that it is the complete opposite. The first thing I thought when I finished reading was that this should be renamed, Grandmas Guide to Pregnancy. This book is in desperate need of a revision. The author refers to stirup pants and the show Cheers as if they are still currently en vogue. She also recommends not exercising during pregnancy, making comments like no one ever looks fit during pregnancy. This was clearly written before anybody saw Madonna pregnant, and that was over  years ago. I gained no insight, and certainly could not relate to the author. I would not recommend this book to any woman currently pregnant who is looking for a girlfriend experience."
0,"Beware of track listing First of all, in actuality, Vertigo  at least the one I received does not have the bside Are You Gonna Wait Forever? which is, by the way, a pretty good song, so make sure that you are getting what . . . uh . . . you are looking for.That said, if you have not heard Vertigo, then you are living under a rock. Can you say, ElevationPart Dos? The Jacknife Lee remix of Vertigo is OK, as far as remixes go, but is nothing earthshattering. Finally, the cover version of the Kraftwerk tune, Neon Lights, is atmospheric, but a bit droll."
0,"Its not what its cracked up to be. The book provides you with cursory information and skims over specifics and details. It is not, in my opinion, a complete guide but more of a checklist or overview of special event management. In addition, there is not much to glean from the successful strategies that are showcased, because these too, are not indepth the book does not really say how they were successful, just that they were successful. It is definitely not for someone doing research on entering this field."

0,"Disappointing This was the worst hair clipper I have ever used. It didnt cut hair at all, but just combed through it. The blades worked intermittantly, seemed to work about  of the time I was attempting to give the haircut, however it was mostly like combing through the hair without cutting anything. It sounded like the blades were turning off and on, whether plugged in or charged. I think this was a defective unit, I returned it for a refund but seller would not return delivery and return shipping which amounted to almost as much as the unit itself. Ultimately, I was dispppointed not only in the product but the service as well, and am not sure I will order from Amazon again."

I have a Kenwood receiver and moved recently where I was getting a little static on some of the channels I listen to. Bought this thinking it would get rid of the static. It does not get any better reception at all! I can put a piece of speaker wire in the back and get just as good of a signal as this. I even tried running a piece of coax up into the attic and hooking this up but it gets just as good reception with just the coax as it does when I plug this into the end. Not worth my time to send it back, just leaves a bad taste in my mouth."

0,"A Failed Attempt I hate to beat a dead horse or a dead novel, but this pathetic patch of prose is more than poorly written it is a failed attempt at what could have been an enjoyable read. The premise of the story, a bending of time, is an interesting basis for a plot, but it is of a nature which requires deft handling and an artful writing style, neither of which are to be found in this novel. It is populated with cartoonish characters, none of whom are particularly likeable, who are so unlifelike as to reach beyond the ridiculous, afflicted with childish dialogue and unbelievably distorted judgement. In a word  Yuk!"
0,"Wow, what were they thinking? Well, I tried to get the dumb Barbie doll to work, but no matter how hard you try, it doesnt register. Then I realized you have to have a compatible DVD player to have it to work. The problem with this is that the product does not warn you that you need a certain DVD player to play. Anyway, looking at the back of the case, there are only three little minigames and it actually advertises that there is up to thirty minutes of gameplay. This is a waste of .

0,"BLURAY new scenes Dont get me wrong, the Shining is one of my favorite movies. I love Kubrick. But Im sick of the new features that the studios feel they HAVE to include to justify the UPGRADE. In the case of classic movies, the improved video and audio is just enough. If they incluye a new documentary or long lost interviews is ok, but as the disc extras, not, please, as part of the feature film. Or al least, please put the option to play the movie without these escenes.They include here i think at least  new disc chapters. These extra footage is not in the DVD or the theatrical version of the film. In result, the film lost of its timing and rythm. Its now a little slow paced and has lost some of the mistery of the plot, because of this extra information depicted.Even Kubrick after the premiere of the film decided to remove all this footage to make to improve the picture. Why the studio decide to incluye these footage after all?"

I was very disappointed in this dark and weird version. If I had read the editorial more closely I would not have bought it.
0,"These things do not work I actually bought mine at a retail store,  huge and  extralarge I never tried these in the box. I used the  huge ones for throw pillows and throws. I like to change these out seasonally. I followed the instructions and at first I thought it was pretty neat. They really do sink down and everything flattens out. However...over the next few days and weeks they slowly popped back up. I thought maybe I did something wrong and so I redid them over again...again they sunk back down flat. But this time they expanded even more quickly than before. I thought what do I have to do, put duct tape over the round plastic tab closure? Why should I have to do that? Probably wouldnt have worked anyway. I had bought two vinyl covered storage chests for my cats to sit in front of the window on, and I put my pillows and throws inside those. Hopefully I can return these and get back my money."
0,wood stake puller i purchased the stake puller primarily for wood stakes. the concept of the puller is OK but the performance is useless for anything you cant pull out by hitting side to side and pulling out by hand. the jaws for the stakes are to short and the peg just slips off when you apply pressure. if the jaws were at lease an . long the tool would probably work better. it doesnt seam like there was much product testing when it was designed.bottom line if your pulling wood pegs  or more in the ground dont waste your money unless you plan on modifying the puller.
0,"Technical Difficulties... and no response I love Northern Exposure, and Im definitely buying season . However, Im going to have to repurchase season  due to defects. The Aurora Borealis episode wont play a few scenes it actually requires me to eject the disk, put it back in, and then fast forward through the hanging scenes. Ive read that this is a common problem for people. Unfortunately, I was past Amazons return window when this happened, and Universal doesnt stand by their quality...Great show! Unfortunately, not given the handling it deserves."
0,"Pathetic Why is it movie producers and best selling authors feel compelled to send us dreck on the heels of a tightly crafted story well told? Presumedly greed and a profound disregard for the intelligence of the audience drive this. Son of a Witch barely aspires to being a sophomoric sorry to the sophomores out there ode to teenaged angst told against a backdrop of the Sound of Music, Dr Doolittle, Lord of the Rings, and The Wizard of Oz all stewed into a thin soup served in a very shallow bowl. One Star because zero wasnt a choice."
0,poor constructioncoffee tastes like tea I am so disappointed after using Farberware electric coffee pots for  yrs. I will never buy one again. The construction is shoddymade in China almost tinlike inner workings are different Coffee tastes bland and just barely warm NOT hot and reliable like it used to be. What happened to the good old days when it was made in the Bronx?I have been willing in years past to replace the pot or the coil after a few years of daily use  I could have lived with that BUT now the new pot just makes a lousy cup of coffee. You too will be disappointed  Now I must find a new brand that makes coffee rapidly and keeps it hot  no microwaving necessary!
0,"It suckedliteraly Steinbecks descrptions are good, but after seeing them in every other chapter, they get really old. He must be stupid to think that we dont know about whats going on during the trip to Oklahoma. Steinbeck was totally out of line whenhe ends the book by having some babyless mother breast feed an old hag that she doesnt even know. Its just totally unreal."
0,"Sometimes it works.....Sometimes it doesnt When I first installed this software, it worked just fine for coping music CDs and copying data to DVDs.Then I noticed after having it for a few weeks, that my computer wouldnt recognize my CDDVD burner. I uninstalled this software and the computer still wouldnt recgonize the drive. I eventually had to restore my HDD to a week before and then my DVD drive came back to life.I reinstalled Roxio Easy CD  DVD Burning once more and the same thing happened.I wouldnt recommend this particular software for anyone."
0,"More mystic than scientific. I was hoping to get more science out of the book. It is about reincarnation, traveling through time, and Atlantis. Nothing about building the Coral Castle except that he did it at night when no one was looking and no one knows how he did it. Hmmmm....magic I suppose....it was not what I expected. If you are into reincarnation and believe in Atlantis, you might enjoy the book.I do like one idea from the book Nothing is new, everything has been done before. I think this is true in one way or another  humans reinvent and repackage ideas but rarely come up with new ones."

0,"Clue is a mystery This game has excellent graphics and was fun to play UNTIL the problems began. If you have time to waste downloading a patch from Hasbro Interactive, didnt work for my game, and restarting from the beginning, then it probably would be a very good game. I never did make it to the end of the game. I returned Clue for another title. Im a fan of mystery, but this game was too much of a mystery getting it to work for me. Better luck to you."
0,"This book turned me off Stephen King I hate to say this, but this is probably the worst book Ive ever read. Reading the Amazon reviews, it doesnt surprise me that people have read it  times. You HAD to in order to figure out what the heck was going on! I nearly cried at the end  partly in joy for having finished it... partly in sorrow for the hours I lost reading it. I havent read a Stephen King book since I read It years ago. I used to love his books, too... sigh Hopefully Ill get over It one of these days and rediscover Kings work, like the scaryashell Pet Sematary. Now THERES a great book!"

Add up your shipping before purchasing here folks."

0,"No more Toshibas Ive bought two Satellite laptops, and both have had their batteries fail within two years. One of them wont keep a charge for more than a few minutes, and sometimes powers off when you disconnect the AC power the other sometimes just shuts down at the slightest movement. When we called the tech support, they didnt mention that the batteries were subject to recall now I just found out, and Toshiba wont process the recall. I dont know if the problems are battery related, since itll cost  to have Toshiba diagnose the problem. Thats right, FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS once its out of warranty.The screen on the newer laptop  just two years old  has gone funky, with some horizontal lines.They both run somewhat warm, with the fan going nonstop.As you can tell, these are my last Toshiba laptop purchases. Its great value for the first year, so enjoy!"

0,"This app is a dog If you are even remotely serious about your invoicing and accounts receivable, dont even think about wasting forty bucks on this incredibly worthless application. It produces nice looking invoices big deal. You can do the same thing in word processing.

Its total garbage from a software publisher who practically INVENTED garbage."
0,"Poor Quality and poorer customer service I received this pot as a christmas present. It had what looked like a rust spot near the bottom. I had to pay to return it to Cuisinart. They took about a month to return one to me and the one they sent had a dent in it. Of course they were counting on my not returning it again. I kept the pot, used it one time to make soup and the inside bottom of the pot became horribly discolored. I will never buy another Cuisinart product. I have decided that life is too short to let go of my hard earned money to a company with poor quality products and even poorer quality control and customer service. In California, you can return such items to any place that sells Cuisinart. In any other state, you hae to return the product  at your expense  to the manufacturer. Why isnt the California law the same in all states?"

I will not buy this item, and I can only hope that you re watch the films and realize why Ivan Kershner was better than you.

I will never buy anything made by this manufacturer again. Buyer beware. Dont waste your money. They basically admit it is a piece of junk!"
0,"Dont waste your money! This is a dinky little cheaply made toy. It is difficult to use difficult to adjust both dials and hold it still at the same time. It has a tiny little viewing area so, even if you could get it adjusted right you could only look at something really small and keep moving it across to see the whole thing.not even one whole word at a time I would not reccommend buying it. It is, in my opinion, a waste of money."

0,The Vedder show. Pearl Sham. This bands sucks beyond words. After TEN the band became Eddie VEdders solo act of pop rock radio trash. Every album after this has been even worse and Backspacer is the worst yet.
0,Poor movie This movie was too long that left me wanting it to end so I could turn it off. This doesnt have anything of the first  movies and that was a huge disappointment. Hogwarts no longer looks like a school but a gothic castle. I lost interest in the mystery and found the characters lacked depth. Maybe the director should read the books and watch the previous films before making this one.
0,"The Mystery of Martyn Pig I thought the story Martyn Pig, was good. Although i didnt like the beginning and the end of the story it was still decent. Towards the middle of the book I started to get really interested in the story. I like the way the story made me wonder and the suspense got my attention a lot. Towards the end of the story the investigating and the police questioning, really interested me. For a minute,I thought Martyn pig was going to give in. By giving in I mean, tell the truth of the murder of his father. The story was really thrilling and mysterious in many ways. I also think the story could have had a better ending. But after all, the book was ok."
0,"What a disappointment I would never have guessed this was a Bertrice Small novel. The Kadin, the Sky OMalley saga, and others contained strong powerful heroines and strong stories. This heroine was just lame. And the men...all they wanted to do was mount her  and they did, a lot. Why was the author compelled to spend so much time describing debasing sex scenes when the heroine even said it was debasing... many, many times too!?!? It wasnt until I was  through the book when there was finally a make love type of scene. And the number of times the heroine recounted her lifes story to everyone she met was growing old, quick! I cant begin to explan how unappealing the story was and then to add the sex not intimacy it was a waste of Ms. Smalls talent.I read once that Ms. Smalls doesnt deviate from her standard story concept, even in Fantasy. I agree with that. The addition of Faerie magic, sorcery, etc., doesnt anchor this book. It just lacks a story much less a strong lead character."

0,Your Marriage Can Survive a Newborn I bought this book looking for some helpful advice for when our first son arrived. I did not find it with this book. This book is just a couples stories about life with their first. Somewhat interesting but not at all what I was looking for.
0,"A painful read As an avid reader of Alaskan mysteries I was excited to see a new author. Except that the story took so long to unfold, the main character seemed psycotic and morose. The is one of the few books that I have read in past years that I have really disliked. In the first  pages she talks about being a hermit, her dog disappearing for which she doesnt seem upset not wanting to talk to people interesting for a bush pilot has  flashbacks and tells you she basically doesnt want human contact..... If you want a good Alaskan mystery try Christopher Lane or Sue Henry!"
0,"Not very good I actually bought this item from BrandsOn Sale Their products are very poor quality and was very disappointed with it. It is not as shiny as the picture, it actually looked very dirty and used when we received it. Anyhow, This item looks very hightech but it is very simple. It just vibrates and thats it. It doesnt do much of anything. I thought it would have been of better quality.Wouldnt recommend this item."
0,"Argument not supported Ever since Custers debacle at Little Big Horn numerous stories about survivors have popped up. This is another one of those stories. While on the surface this book may seem compelling, the authors argument is not. The authors lack of notation and sources creates numerous problems for serious historians. A glimpse through the slightly less than two page bibliography reveals that the author, who identifies himself as an amateur historian, has not done exhaustive primary research. The sources that he lists are generally secondary and there is a sprinkling of published primary sources.The authors lack of documentation also does not bode well for this book in academic circles. Suggesting that Heath was the sole survivor and not providing one footnote is a poor methodological practice.In all this book offers nothing more than another survivor story. This book is of no great historical significance because nothing is substantiated."

0,"Probably the Worst Book Ive Ever Read My brother gave me this book as a Christmas present, thinking that I might find it entertaining. Unfortunately, after reading a few of the stories, I was just bored with the whole thing. Ok dude, we get it. You are a bad guy. You like to drink. You have hooked up with some girls. I guess if I had never done any of the above, I would be able to live vicariously through such a book. I even checked out his website and the only thing that I really found funny is the fact that this guy has got to be close to  years old and he still hangs out in fraternity houses. Its probably time to move on with your life. I cant believe people are stupid enough to pay for such badly written stories. I guess this was my brothers payback for not getting him a present last year."
0,"A beginners book with plenty of the BOL thrown in This book is a joke. Many if not most of the chapters contain nothing that is not in the BOL or in MSDN. Particularly bad is the replication chapter. Anyone can do screen prints of wizards that prompt you through most of the work. Theres abosolutely nothing in this chapter that isnt in the BOL in fact, theres far less.The other complaint I have is how woefully bad the writing is. Wrox books are known for being the worst in the industry, but this one takes them to new lows. The guy cannot write. The wording is the strangest, most uneven stuff youll ever see. Its horid. Do yourself a favor and skip this one. There has to be a better publication out there for MS SQL developers. Heck, if nothing else, use the BOL  its better than this lame retread."
0,"Hes written better. Now dont get me wrong  I love Bill Brysons writing. But this one seems to be from his early work, where he mostly travels around and expresses his discontent with a citys architecture and planning. Theres not a lot else to fleshout the story. After a while it gets a little old. For something more varied and less critical, try A Walk in the Woods. That is a great read. As is A Short History of Nearly Everything go for the illustrated version. Those are both books that I eagerly read over and over again."
0,"Never Used and Already Rusted!!! Purchased the muffin pan assuming it was made of aluminum. It is not aluminum rather it is made of tin! Nowhere in the listing is the type of metal listed. The seller might claim that the title of Muffin Tin states the metal type but this does not sit well with me. When I received the muffin pan I took the brand new pan and washed it. The pan rusted only after one washing and was never used. When I requested a return from the seller the only response was we are sorry to hear that, but please remember that anything that is made out of tin requires a thourough drying to avoid rusting.Do not buy this pan as it is not durable and be wary of a seller that knows the products they are selling is inferior and will not stand behind the items they are selling!!!"
0,"Scandalous to pay the price! Second waste of money for my business trip! I wanted something light and entertaining. Never read Johanna Lindsey so thought this should be a nice piece of fluff. What a waste of money.It started out pretty well and I kept hoping after the hero and heroine met it would take off! What a DUD. The plot was endless drivel and the solution was in the twilight zone. I didnt like either the hero or the heroine. They had no depth. And the love story   this is love???Well, the aiport bookstore and Ms Lindsey made money on me. Not again!"
0,"Twirlin Whirlin piece of junk... Thats why my husband calls the toy.

0,"When Shallow meets Pen I could not handle Ms. Dumas book. She uses repetitively dont get me wrong. She jumps from one subject to another with very little background explanation suddenly, we find her in France bathing in the MED. She brings an idea up, but never expands on it. For instance, she decides not to change her name, and her only reason because the day she wanted to change her name a friend with the same name came to visit her. Dont get me wrong, there are thousands names in the English language for girls that she could have chosen.As an emigrant to the US, I thought she will bring some insight about what she learned here, and what makes both cultures different. Unfortunately, one learn about this culture and her culture, and her writing makes her look shallow, in spite of a her graduating Cum Laude."

I also found the same video for free online, and there was no new information on there.

It doesnt hold quite as many ounces as I would have liked, but that isnt the issue. Its impossible to clean.

I wouldnt recommend this to anyone."
0,"Horrible! I dont review much on Amazon but I am compelled to for this one. First off, there is only one  minute workout on this dvd, which is surprising. Second, the instructor is incredibly annoying. Most spin instructors are, but this guy takes the cake. All he does is talk, there really is very little working out on this DVD. He prepares you for two  minute intervals by talking about them each for  minutes. The music is in no way synced up to the intervals, so you feel like something is not quite right as youre pushing yourself. Then, the dude stops pedaling right in the middle of the last push to talk more! I have had instructors that were pregnant that never stopped. Youre supposed to keep going no matter what! Overall I am incredibly disappointed, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY."
0,This Popover Pan Stucks It worked for a few times at first. And now its virtually impossible to remove stuck popovers from this pan. Its the gracious replacement pan from Williams Sonoma after the first pan hopelessly clung to each popover too. The instructions were followed to the letter with the same stuck results. It appears the nonstick finish might disappear with use. Vegetable spray and chunks of butter as directed didnt resolve the issue. Perhaps there is a pick and shovel popover removal tool that should be included. Will return it.

No, its not supposed to be radiohead, but it is a quick buck for the record companies. Dont dive into temptation."
0,Not the best beginners book The title makes it seem that this book has organized lessons by Bobby Fischer. In fact there is very little written text. It is basically a problem book with very simple checkmates.A lot of space is used very big diagrams and not a lot of material is covered.This being said if you are looking for a good problem book for beginners I really like Winning Chess Tactics For Juniors by Hays.If you are looking for a great first book that really teaches chess using lessons then there is no better book than Chess For Juniors by Snyder.

0,"design flaw on clasp . I love citizen eco drive watches.They are usually so painlessly carefree. This model, however, is not a good pick!. If you need the band sized,as I did, the band now fits perfectly, but to unclasp the watch, you have to reach inside between watch and wrist to manuever the deployment clasp.Its next to impossible.I understand the reason... the band then looks like its all one piece. its just not worth the trouble. I literally had to stick a pointed object under the watch to get it to release. A sharp, pointed object near your radial artery is just never a good idea. Think twice here."
0,"batteries problem My daughters got this camera for Christmas. The battery life wasnt good but that isnt a fatal problem, but when they changed them, the new batteries didnt work at all. Finally they got some alkalines that functioned for a while . Now they get exactly one picture out of the fully charged alkaline batteries and then the low battery sign goes on and it dies. And there is no way I am going to invest in rechargable canon batteries for this camera when it is obviously defective. So i will be sending it in for repair . And one bad camera doesnt make a bad product but I am reading about this issue repeatedly from people who have bought the camera and had the same problem. So i say its a defect and anyone who buys it is taking a risk."
0,"kinda lame The quality of construction of these gaskets was fairly lame. They did the job but just.The outer layers of metal were well separating from each other when the arrived, but I figuredonce they were clamped down between the head the exhaust pipe, the sandwich of material wouldbe held together okay. Price was cheap so you get what you pay for, right?"
0,"I love the concept, but... I thought this was a great idea, and it still could be. Two problems The straps are too cheap. Ive broken two of them by just tugging on them a little too hard while trying to make them tight enough. And the nails need to be tapered. As they are, they quickly fill up with debris as you walk around, making you have to stop and clean them. I think they would selfclean if the nail was a little wider at the top than at the point."
0,"Worse than an icepick in your eyes This is my pick for the WORST movie EVER. The sound track is like listening to a crying baby, someone scratch a blackboard, and white noise at the same time.

Hell couldnt be much worse than watching this movie. I cant believe I made it to the ending credits. I must be a masochist."

0,"Very disappointing I purchased this primarily to clean tile grout lines in our shower and bathtub. However, the unit failed miserably. The only cleaning that was accomplished with this unit was actually done by the brushtip of the nozzle scraping against the grout lines. Mind you, this is not grout stain I am trying to clean, but simple mildew that comes off with a sponge. I was hoping to get past the tedium of cleaning these grout lines with a toothbrush or by hand, but it looks like old fashioned elbow grease continues to be required.Also, the unit is VERY noisy! My ears were ringing after using it for a half an hour. Recommend wearing earplugs."

0,"Like all of Lawlers books incomplete and biased. ... A martial arts novice could get better information by spending an hour or two on the internet.Lawler is obviously very knowledgable about Tae Kwon Do, but like all her other books, her bias towards it is obvious and the misinformation hits you in the head like a round kick.For the  you spend on the book, youd be better off picking up a bunch martial arts magazines at the grocery store or book store."

The medicinal aftertaste lasted for several hours."
0,"Diaper Bags, Not That Great. I have bought the Diaper Sacks at WalMart and Babies R Us. When I purchased these bags on line I thought they would be the same....they are not. These bags require you to tear them off the roll and then tie a knot in them to hold the dirty diaper. These are not worth the money, when you can buy the other diaper sacks that are already perforated and sealed on one end. I would not recommend these!"
0,"Boyoboy is this bad! I bought this for my husband who thought it would be a laugh, we are both singers and also play a lot of music. However I listened to this CD and thought it was utterly dreadful, not at all funny, just dreadful. My husband is in two minds about it, but has only listened to part of it once! So I think that says it all. Therefore I would not recommend this CD."
0,"Bad acting ... worse story Its stuff like this that gives science fiction a bad name. No wonder there isnt more of it.Of course the acting and the story arent the only things lacking. The special effects also suck and the action sequences are badly coreographed.Basically, its just a bunch of people pretending to shoot each other and beat each other up, with none of the advantages of a good movie."

0,"Bleach This book had too much sex in it for my tastes. The characters were underdeveloped, and I didnt really care about them at all. The book just ended without any explination or ending. It wasnt scary, either. For a good book go read Bradbury or someone else, but not The Rising."
0,"Too heavy I bought these tweezers based on the awesome reviews. When I tried them, I found that they were so heavy, and the edge so sharp that it cut every eyebrow hair at the base, instead of pulling them out by the root. Make sure to pluck veryyyyy slowly, if you slip and grab a bit of you skin, you will get cut for sure. I had to run to the store to buy different tweezers."

When Im in the mood for a happy little vampire romance, I pick up one of Feehans books but this book was excrutiating! It went on forever. Im serious  about  of this book was one of the  main characters professing their undying love, admiration, lust, or tormented desire for the other. The plot sounded like something someone came up with in about  minutes  Quick  in  minutes or less come up with a plot! It was stupid and made ZERO sense. The sad part was it started out with promise  that was probably the one and only thing that drove me to finish this book. By the final half of the book I was basically scanning the pages instead of reading searching for any key words that would lead me to believe that the plot would pick up at some point. This book was TERRIBLE!!!"

I, for one, would be quite intrigued if it were true, and did initially find it plausible, before I went factchecking.

I was disappointed to receive season  in a different box than the rest of the seasons I own. Particularly since the pictures of the box set show the correct packaging Im used to. Why the change? Im tempted to return the item and request original packaging, or to at least contact Amazon and ask why it has changed."
0,"Did anyone else think this sucked? This movie was boring, pointless, and plotless. I cant believe people are giving this movie the highest amount of stars. Tom Cruise looks ugly, and Jamie Foxx has the most disgusting flavor saver on his face. Not only does riding in a taxi suck, but movies about them do too. And as a New Yorker, I can tell you that the chance of getting an Englishspeaking cabbie is rare, as well as a clean cab, along with a nice driver. In a totally braindead movie, the only good thing about this movie is that it ends. I looked at my watch several times, as well as  trips to the restrooms. I almost fell asleep. There was like zero action and the previews tell the whole story. Dont waste your time or your money on this movie."
0,"Not Made to Last! Ive had three of these machines. The first two were from Haier. The first one stopped working during the warranty period. They gave me a hassle, but finally replaced it. The second one lasted less than two years and stopped. The NewAir is the identical machine and it has lasted  months. These are not cheap and they certainly should last longer than that. I give up!"
0,"No original material, as far as I can tell. I agree with a previous reviewer who found fault with the way the story was told. There is no excitement in describing the stages. They are just wrapped up all of a sudden.To me, it did not seem like the author did many interviews of his own. It seems like he just watched the Tour de France and retold what he saw on the broadcast. His supposed backstories which should be really interesting, all seem like a recap of the mini segments during the Tour broadcast that let you know more about the participants.There is just nothing that reaches out and grabs you, and makes you want to keep reading. I finally quit it after the poor description of the day in the Pyrenees. That is one of the most exciting stages of the race, and the narrative was so wooden."
0,"Not great My dad bought the big, white  FurReal cat for my daughter. What a disappointment. Hardly any of the functions worked! It hissed the first few times the tail was pulled, then stopped. It would not lay down or paw. I contacted Hasbro, they sent a mail sticker so we could return it for a new one or something of equal value. After a wait so long I almost forgot we had sent it off, our replacement arrived today. For the big,  FurReal cat my daughter was sent a Fur Real friends newborn puppy  and an IDog ...which she isnt even old enough to play with! We did call Hasbro again and fortunately talked with a very nice customer service rep. They are mailing coupons to make purchases that are more suitable for my daughter in order to make things right. The toy may not have been great, but at least they are willing to make their customers happy."
0,"Crashes, hangs and slow! My installation went without a problem. I can start laying out my house after watching the video tutorial. Everything went smoothly after a few rooms were layed out. Things start to become slow and nonresponsive after that. I have a AMD  cpu,  gb of ram and nvidia  gt card so I dont think it is my machine. The application will disappear in front of you from time to time they are really thoughtful to provide an auto save feature. When you reopen a plan you have worked for hours the other day, the program will spin with  cpu usage and refuse to open up your plan.Bottomline, if you want to design a room or two, buy this. If you want to create a house, forget it."

0,"Depressing I found this book very depressing. Anne Lamotts constant selfdeprecation throughout the book caused me to really doubt myself as well. I know she is doing it to show that shes human just like the rest of us, but I think she can show that without hating on herself every chance she gets saying the yearold version of herself looked like a neurotic cat woman, etc. despite what she says about how you shouldnt do that. Its like hanging around with a bunch of anorexic models, it gets to you.This is not a good book for people who are not sure they are writers. I am not a writer but I am interested in writing and I would very much like to write fiction but I have a lot of trouble writing authentically. Lamott sends the message that As long as youre a writer, as long as youre in our secret little club, everything will be okay!"

0,"Stick with ANY other Matrix Analysis book. I was excited to get this book and excited for my matrix structural analysis course. This book leaves a lot to be desired. Examples are not completely developed. The author skips steps and simplifications leading to hours of trying to figure out what the author is doing and where equations come from. The tone of the author is arrogant, assuming everyone will understand his incompletely developed ideas. Publishing is subpar with ink spots and pencil marks throughout. Stick with a more completely developed textbook for a class itll be well worth the couple dollars more."
0,Neither erotic nor horror I am not a fan of Jess Franco and Mansion of the living dead is the second of his movies I have seen. The movie has some innovative ideas when combining horror and erotism but it does not deliver either. It was a disappointing experience for me.

0,"why i dont like this game!!!!! This game was a complete disapointment, i bought it feb, and the game simply wasnt worth it. The gameplay was nothing at all like forbidden memories, it was more like dungeon dice. They should have specified the kind of game it was going to be. In the reviews and when i saw the screenshots i thought that the graphics were awsome and i also thought that it was going to be like the trading card with all the rules and all because as we all know that forbidden memories even though it was very realistic it lacked almost every single rule in the game. I recommend to everyone do not buy this game, youll simply be wasting your money, better buy the gba game eternal duelist soul. it has all the rules and the gameplay its what I think were all looking for.!!!!"

0,"I have to agree I have to agree with most of the others who have written reviews on this book. I LOVED the first two in the Dark series. But i couldnt even finish this one, im jumping ahead to Gregoris story. I absolutely hated Alex. Just like everyone else was saying, she was snobbish, and selfish. I kept reading, hoping shed get over her hysterical period and finally LISTEN to Aidian about what shed become, but she kept pushing him away, and being what i thought was really closeminded about the whole thing. I couldnt stand her to the point where i was reading with my teeth gritted, so i just put the book down. ill keep reading the rest of the series bc i adored the first two. I just hope the rest to come are far better than this one."
0,"SONGS ARE THE PROBLEM, BAD PRODUCTION DOESNT HELP The bottom line is that the songs just arent there on this new CD. Although some maybe catchy hero, inbetween, others have absolutely ZERO relevance to the average listener supergig, television, the F word. Looks like the band has fallen into the trap of writing about how difficult life is to be a rockstar, and collect the money that goes along with it. Come on guys, how bad do you think we are going to feel for your pain of stardom?? With the big name producers on this record, Im surprised at the substandard quality of the production at a nice cost Im sure. Like the first single for radio, hero, this disc wont have much time in my player. My summary is that there are many other bands doing WAY MORE with this tired genre."

0,"Still All About the Guy Women? Hmmm. We want to climb into a story and be the character. I thumbed through these stories looking for one with a female narrator. Shes probably hidden somewhere in the book, but it wasnt worth the effort to look after six failed attempts. Even if the female characters in the book were sensual, beautiful, enticing, etc., they were always being described as such by a male character who was going to have something done to him. So what. I dont want to have to work to get a turn on from a story. I want the narrative from the females perspective. Presented that way, it makes it easier for me to slip in to the story and be the female character. If Im always trying to mentally rewrite a mans story to fit myself, then the true story does not awaken the primal part of me. The stories we have in our own heads are richer than those between the pages of this book. My advice Women, pass this man by."

It is a lowbudget B grade horror movie, but there is no trick. You arent suckered into buying something and dissapointed. ROADISDE massacre is a fun horror movie that is made by people who love the genre and made to be an hommage to the great horror movies. Its also funny... And quite well made given budget, etc.Night Nurse Massacre tricks you into renting it, you realize you blew money on something you could have found elsewhere for free. Honestly, the artwork isnt even that good.I like Amazon becasue we can all be honest."

This should not be an adult education book, the assumption was a big turnoff. This is not a study guide either  the whole chapter on study secrets read likes a copy and paste out of a second rated studytips website. Speed reading, mnemonics and mind map have little, if at all, benefits helping anyone passing technical certifications.Subjects such as asking for a pay rise after certification, moving up, job hunting .... are better left with other books.Pros the References at the back are useful. Cut the size of the book in half, focus on only the essentials, then it may earn another point."

0,"Rent it first... This game is fun at first, the graphics are really nice.After a while along with loads of frustrations and ridiculous missions and objectives this game loses its luster. Its really unrealistic for example, doing skateboard tricks while jumping out of an airplane. Also the slowmo thing is really annoying especially for people who dont like to use the Dpad and prefer to use the Analog. The only skate game Ill possibly buy is EAs S.K.A.T.E because it focuses on the real side of skating."
0,"Rent it, dont buy it I rented it and am glad. It is not worth the buying price. It has a difficult to watch format and while the astute viewer may pick up some information, it is not much. The  trainers are good at what they doHOWEVERthe entire concept of putting this much pressure on very young horses is a bad one. The trainers had to push the horses too fast and too far. This was not training but flooding, even when done with some feel and timing. Parelli makes himself look like an ass at the end, Cameron just pushed his colt too hard through out and Lyons is the best of the worst that day. All  know how to properly train a young horse and this venue was not it."

0,Feeling Bulimic? This Will Help I wanted to throw up while watching this film. What a horrible depiction of a saints life  it is sacreligious and false. One scene I find difficult to forget is Therese calling Christ the best lover she ever had. I could not suffer through the entire film and it is NOT meant for a Catholic audience. Im not even a religious person and this offended me. Another reviewer points out that the director is an atheist it shows in his final product.
0,"Get the console version this one isnt as good. I bought this GBA gamewell, actually my grandma did and Im pretty sorry I chose this one. There are two things that I dont like about this cart. First, I love the challenge of beating my own high scores but you cant save your high scores. Second, there is no rapid fire in Galaga and Galaxian. If I hold down the button, it only fires once. You have to keep pressing the button to fire. This really slows the game down. It takes twice as long to defeat one wave of enemies as it does in Microsofts Return of Arcade for the PC. Those games arent as fun on the GBA. Aside from those two flaws, theres nothing else to critisize."
0,"Works great, if you want to waste time spinning the wheel Got this product today, tried it out, and it worked fine....instructions state that the cd should make  full revolution, and that it moves slowly....that is the biggest understatement ever.

Im not exactly a busy man, but paying  bux to spend  minutes cranking this wheel is not a good deal. Splurge for the Electric version, unless your right arm needs a workout."

The graphics are substandard you must have a inch TV in order to read the titles, the gameplay is simple and not very interactive just press X to roll, press X to buy, and you will be pressing X for a long time with no real interaction with the game. The animations are dull when the hat moves you have to wait a longgg time before it arrives to its final square...obviously, you could turn the animations off, but that would just make the game even sleepier...If you were waiting for a Monopoly game such as the ones made for PCs, this is not the case. Maybe you should wait for another PS version of this great game."

Rickety bowl rotation mechanism and equally loose motor pivot makes for pitiful sight when working on tougher dough. Very inconvienient tilt release. Noisy and it sounds incompetent.

Electronic speed controls are by definition poorly suited for mixing tasks. Top handle got loose on third use. Returned to store one week later."
0,"Stick to the magazine articles, Alan. I suggest a new subtitle Wine, Wealth, and Enough Filler to Stretch a Feature Article into a Book DealThis book could be summer reading for a th grader, but if youve read Napa or East of Eden, you probably have higher expectations for the proffered subject matter. A Tale of Two Valleys will leave you wanting particularly a refund."
0,Worst Movie Ive ever seen Unfortunatley I had to give one star to this crappy movie and as I have seen Im not the only one who feels the same way that I doThis Movie sucks. It is bad and boring. BAD BAD BAD. Dont waste your time and money on this one.
0,"Skip It! Although this movie is regarded as a dark comedy, the comedy fails to support the dark side of a drug addict woman, stereotypical dumb woman, stereotypical I have done everything right, I am in control, I am in my s, and I am pretty so why doesnt anyone love me women, and the stereotypical over weight, homely, sweet woman. I understand the writerdirector was trying to portray women as selfish, rough around the edges, and gritty in a way the audience has not seen on screen before but they just seemed sad and weak. Even Regans explicit them! mantra fails to resonate at the end."
0,"Kindle Edition Havent even been  pages into this thing and am already frustrated that this ebook was not set up for localization. I dont know if this is a feature of the Kindle ebook format, but it should be. There are so many pages of nonEnglish I must skim through to get to the next meaningful topic its absurd. Secondly, I cant see the images clearly for the pieces of the violin even when zooming in."
0,"Breaks after a month...stay away My grandson loved this toy because of the sounds and the lights. A month later it wasnt working at all. We thought it was the batteries and changed them, but sure enough nothing was working. We called Tonka and then they passed us off to the company that manufactures them...P.S. I still havent heard from them and its been almost  months. Its not worth the money! I highly recommend you buy some other brand of firetruck for your lilfirefighters"
0,Pippi Longstocking Movie I ordered this movie for my daughter because her friend is dressing up as Pippi for Halloween. So I thought the movie would be an easy way to let her know about Pippi. I think the movie has a lot of bad behavior and disrespect for adults in it. The beginning was pretty scary with the storm too. So I wont let my daughter watch it again.
0,Two balls and no book I get the impression from other reviews i have read that what you are buying is a book with two miracle balls thrown in for free.What I got was the two balls in the box. Nothing else.I really dont know what Iam supposed to do with these balls.
0,"Predictable Nothing too exciting about this book. Pretty predictable if youve ever read any other V.C. Andrews series. Also not a fan of nd cousins being in an intimate relationship. Boring read, but Im the type of person who has to finish a book, even if its painfully boring. Was glad to finally get to the end."

0,"Cloak and dagger The product is probably good, but, they DONT tell you you need to buy flushable kitty litter which is next to impossible to buy unless you want to buy it from them and they charge an arm and a leg for the product and shipping and handling, nor do they tell you until you get it they expect you to put the cat litter box in your bathroom to get the cat used to it.

As it is, it sits in its box in storage."
0,"Stay Away These batteries work OK, if they work at all. Thats the problem Out of a brand new pack of , only a fraction of them actually work, meaning take and hold a charge without making my chargers defective battery indicator starts blinking. And of the ones that work, they dont work for very long. Dont even dream of getting a light years distance from the up to  recharges. Also, and perhaps most disturbing, is that shortly after purchase, I noticed that many of the batteries began showing a certain discoloration at the tops which looks a whole lot like battery leakage. This was true of batteries still plastic wrapped and never used.Note This review is for the mAh , pack version."

0,"Cant hold a charge Performance was OK overall, but after one year of light use, it does not hold a charge for long. It currently only holds enough energy after a full charge to work for  seconds at full power. There is no possibility of replacing the battery, despite the rest of the system working fine. My next one will certainly not be a Hoover."
0,"Absolute Garbage I enjoyed the first two books in this series enough to read them a second time, but this collaboration was absolutely atrocious.Every indication seems to be that Asprin wrote an outline which Peter J. Heck attempted to flesh out into a book Unfortunately, Peter J. Heck has no sense of character or comedy. I only got a few dozen pages into the book before throwing it against the wall in total disgust, but time and time again I saw scenes which  if the old Robert Asprin had been executing them  would have been hilarious. Here, however, they fell flat and lifeless to the pavement.There are no laughs here. The characters and the scenes are forced. All sense of a point is missing.No matter how much you loved the first two books, avoid this installment at all costs. Indeed, the closer the first two books are to your heart, the deeper this book will thrust the knife."
0,"Could have done way better I would recommend the out of the box cd. It is way better to listen to the album than watch it. I couldnt tell if this was a Prince or Usher concert or a gospel concert. I was seriously waiting for Michael Jackson to make an appearance on the stage. The dvd has way too much self promotion on it and at the same time some sacreligious pictures like where tonex replaces Jesus and puts his facedoesnt make sense. Alot of worldy material on here too, Way too much distractions. Is he suppose to be a man of God looking and dancing like that? Looks like a rock star to me. Towards the end it was alright with Sheila E. and Kirk Franklin but could have been better. This dvd DOES NOT fit in the MUST HAVE catergory, I recommend, Israel and Newbreed live from another level or Marvin Sapp Dairy of a Psalmist those dvds are must have gospel dvds. Im not satisfied with this dvd."
0,"Was Tom Wolfe paid by the word? Thank goodness I bought this book at a discount store my apology to Amazon.com. I started to read it while keeping my wife company as she lay in a hospital bed...I was soon in more pain than she was. Wordy, wordy, wordy,blah, blah, blah. Not very much to say with so very many words. The pages flew by as I skipped page after page of boredom. I finally put it down, after  pages and wont pick it up again. I started reading a book my almost  year old daughter was reading, Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone, and it was far more enjoyable, interesting, and well written. I recommend Harry.... Pass on Toms tome."
0,"BleachALL Clearasil Tinted cream will bleach anything it come in contact with. No exaggeration.

0,"Broke after  months of poor quality photos We bought this camera for my friends wedding overseas. We bought a memory card with it. After taking close to  photos on the memory card it just stopped working and said the camera didnt support the card. After coming back home we called Kodak and they pretty much said it wasnt their problem. How can a camera take pictures and movies on a card and then decide not to support it? At my engagement party we took pictures with this camera and they all came out so dark that unfortunately I have very few pictures of such a special day. And then to top it all off it broke a month later. The LCD screen just stopped working and the pictures would come out completely black. I dont understand how such an expensive camera can have so many problems. Save your money and buy something else, this is nothing but headaches."
0,"Buy the OEM Parts from a GMPartsDirect Monroe tries hard to create products for the aftermarket, but in my opinion always fall short. For the money paid to purchase both front and rear Monroe Shocks from Amazon, I could have purchased the OEM Units from GMPartsDirect and had money left in my pocket and the original ride restored. These units ride very rough and are far from the GM Autoride that I have enjoyed. Upon contacting Monroe to discuss the issue I was given the typical response regarding correct installation. My subsequent reply and phone calls where never returned and thus was never able to explore technical issues or enjoy the advertised Safe and Sound Guarantee."

0,"Borrow it from a friend, dont waste your money on it The CD sounds like it was recorded in a karaoke bar. This artist has a unique voice but her lyrics get overshadowed by the other instruments. Once in a while she manages to hit the right notes but I find her CD rather annoying and insulting. Out of all the songs on her CD Id have to say Iceberg was the best, at the risk of sounding frugal Id have to say buying a CD for one song would be a waste of money. Best stay away from this CD, buying it would be like throwing your money out the window."
0,"Lipsync Letdown I was looking forward so much to enjoying the full first season of my favourite alltime sitcom only to be let down by the fact that in every episode the syncronisation is out. The actors lips are a beat ahead of the sound and it annoyed me so much I took it back and got a refund. As noone else on this review thread has mentioned this Im left wondering if I was just unlucky. Its not just this DVD where Ive noticed the problem, its also on my Curb Your Enthusiasm Season  disc although not quite as noticeable. Needless to say this explains my one star rating, otherwise it would be a definite five."
0,"Couldnt Finish It! This book was just terrible!! I loved his book The Marriage Plot, so I was looking forward to reading this one, which was so acclaimed, but I absolutely hated it. I hated the point of view, but mostly the incredibly ridiculous amount of extraneous detail that he put in, which only took away from the story itself, which was interesting. I stuck it out for half the book, hoping it would get better, but it didnt, and so I moved on to another book."
0,missing hardware First let me say that both this and the  sweeper I ordered both AgriFab were missing multiple nuts and bolts. Youll have to get a better manual online. The one they sent with it wasnt the real one I guess.
0,"Not wild at all I had high hopes for this book  just look at the inside cover to see those hopes, but this story was bogged down with cliches and a storyline to rival a really really bad star trek episode. The whole I feel like I have known you forever vibe between the characters ruined whatever mystery and eroticism there might have been. The Changeling issue should have bee addressed in a more niave manner, since this woman who is seemingly normal has never encountered nor turned into an animal before, she takes it with such a blase manner, its hard for me to believe any of the emotions"
0,"Ultimate Irony Its freezing outside, two homeless men have one possession between them, a heater. The unfortunate thing is, they have no place to plug that heater in.The two men Ben Gary Farmer from Powwow Highway and The Man Steve Quimette find a receipt in the heaters package and theyre going to take a trip to a suburban mall to get a refund. Thatll mean much needed money for both. They travel via the way of the poor, on foot, and they meet a series of truly interesting people from a nurse, a landlady, and several others.Some help, some do not. The Heater is an interesting and ironic take on homelessness in Canada. I confess, I got the film for Gary Farmer, whose superb performance in Powwow Highway made me an instant fan. Id like to say I loved The Heater or I got some great useful truth from it. The hard truth is its heartbreaking and neither of the aforementioned happened.Rebecca Kyle, July"
0,disappointment I am a yoga teacher and I own many yoga dvds.Usually I can predict if it will be a winner.Well this time I was very wrong.I dont know why anyone gave it five stars. Firstly it is so distracing with the noise and the movement and most importantly are you supposed to follow along? There is no instruction at all! This is a dvd of Tara Stiles showing off her yoga poses! Very decieiving unless it should have been titled Tara Stiles doing her yoga for herself. Maybe she should watch shiva Rea or some of the other qualified teacher to see how you teach yoga on a dvd rather than just showing off the poses...

0,This Scale Is Not Accurate I bought this scale and it registered about  lbs less then the doctors scale. I took it back to the store and they replaced it with the same model. I again tried the scale and it was still  to  lbs less then my normal body weight. My wife and kids tried the scale and their weight was also  to  lbs less then their normal weight. My advice is to to by another brand!
0,A boring book A Separate Peace was a book that I had to read for my summer reading list from school. The whole book was very descriptive and I guess original but the plot itself was extremely boring. I had to force myself to finish it.
0,"Pitiful... I cant believe I wasted  on this stupid thing. It looked nice and pretty and all, but looks are deceiving if thats how you spell it. Its comfortable, but thats just about the only good thing. This thing pretty much is not pressure sensitive. Lets say you move the analog stick just a wee little bit, your character in the game moves a bit slow. You move it a wee bit more, and the character moves at maximum speed. And the stick isnt even touching the frame of the controller. Also, when using the analogs, they seem to have a tendency to get stuck. For example, you move the analog stick all the way out in one direction, lets say, to make the game character turn. You bring back the stick to the middle and the character is still turning. The price looks good, but its not worth it. Your best off going with an official controller, like ones made by Sony or Logitech."
0,"Give me a break These two writers maxed out their talent with Les Miz. These tunes are cheap imitations. Live with someone you love. Uh, ok, I hadnt thought of that.

0,"One year and dead I am very disappointed in this Sony. I have had it for exactly one year and the CD Player has died. It was dying a slow death for a couple weeks now  skipping tracks, long start up time especially MPs which take a good five minutes to read and poor sound. It just died today  it can no longer read any type of disk I put into it.For the price it is a joke. You can get a lot better value than this player.It does have MP capability, CD, tapes and AMFM, but for me the most important thing was the CDs and noteably the MP function.Shop around. You can certainly do better!"
0,"Some MAJOR BUGS I gave this to my yr yesterday for his birthday. He loved playing the game...when it worked. Within  hour of playing,  of the games on the cartridge were disengaged or locked up. He couldnt access them anymore. Initially I thought he had done something to the cartridge but, after some research online, I discovered that many people have had the same problems with Animal Genius. Some have even reported  out of the  games being locked after  to  animals were identified which doesnt take long. I wish I would have done more research before purchasing this game, but I never expected I would have to do such a thing, especially for a game costing over ...?! Although this game is educational and fun for children, save your money for something that gives more game time. I am highly disappointed Leapster would put out such a poor quality item, not to mention not fixing a bugged game still being sold to unsuspecting, well meaning parents."

0,"See the original! I dont know how this skunk got  and  stars on Amazon let alone one! I could hear Hepburn, Bogart and Holden rolling over with a resounding boom. I think this is mainly because of Fords Linus. He is a very unsympathetic character in this remake. The film critics said that, while the original Sabrina was about her transformation, this version was about Linus transformation. But here Linus shows no transformation that you can really see. His explanation to Sabrina for his deceitful romancing at the end There was a merger, and you were in the way. No hard feelings is very cold compared with Bogarts Would you believe I enjoyed every minute of it? In the original, you get the feeling that Sabrina gets the right man you dont get that here at all."

0,"show sucks I am a fan of the original five and this show is a joke to the standards of the old show of the s. The old series had no lingering story lines but for Wo Fat, each episode was a stand alone gem. The men of Fiveo dressed in suits and were classy, these new guys dress like bums, like they just walked into a bar on a Friday night. The musical score in the new series is loud, over the top and often just out of place with the content of the scenes. The editing is fast in your face, made for a child with ADD. The actors all look pretty much the same, no great character distinctions here. This new show is just bad."
0,"Completly Uneccesary You really dont need this product to duel with. It is just a flimsy little peice of plastic that breaks itself. When it snaps into duel mode it just breaks. Since you cant fit cards with card protectors into them, the cards get bent, torn, or ripped. You play your favorite holo card in the slot, its destroyed, you pull it out of the slot, and now you have two of your favorite holo cards. You think Konami would try to make a product that doesnt damage the cards! Good job Konami! You wasted your time and money, and you wasted millions of other kids money."
0,"AMPM Editions Wish I could agree with the liner notes  in that  Georges choice of music brings one to their knees. The only thing that brought me to my knees was the price of each CD for the quality of music that was mixed in the AMPM Editions. This should have been a  CD set. AM amounts to Noise a boring downbeat a monotonous bass line and noisy synths.PM is only mediocre at best. I purchased both the AM and PM editions without hesitation because I was so impressed with Outstanding work on Awake. What a mistake, so much for Acostanation. The only thing that was Accosted was my wallet."

0,"Disappointing and Frustrating Oddly engaging, yet wholly unbelievable. The firstperson narrator is charmless and preachy, and the circumstances surrounding the relationship between the teenage boy and the older woman not to mention the relationship itself is completely ludicrous and poorly motivated. I like the idea of a novel dealing with latergeneration Nazi guilt from the German citizen perspective, but the issue is so weighed down with theoretics, rather than true feelings or thoughts, that it comes across dry and essayist, instead of compelling fiction as truth. A different author with this material may have hit gold, but Schlink fails to ignite much of anything here, and the result is disappointing and a bit frustrating."

0,"five stars? I realize it may seem hypocritial of me to criticize the guy who gave Revolver one star on top of all the five star ratings and then bash this, but what I say here is my genuine opinion. This is far and away the Beatles worst album. There just isnt much good I can say about itNONE of the songs are memorable. I listened to this three or four times when I first bought it, some five years ago, and I havent since. Only a necessary purchase for Beatles completists."
0,Buyer beware The original versions of these hits were pretty much mastered to perfection on their original albums. This collection was somewhat of a disappointment with just a few exceptions from even my first listen. It should be clearly labeled as a remix collection. Any ear familiar with these hits from this late great artist will quickly recognize that these versions sound way different the originals.
0,"Cute... but does not keep time well. I have two of these. They are so cute... very small... adjustable color display... easy to set.

0,You could call it a concept album.... the concept being a band working as a democracy  which appears to be true  everybody gets their songs on this album and theyre all given proper respect and placement. But what the album seems to lack is collective harmony  or a momentum that keeps your attention from song to song. Some of songs that were meant to be simplified by minimalist arrangements are left too bare to hide the weak vocal performances. And some of the lyrics.. there are some that WILL make you cringe.. leave you wondering if democracy for the String Cheese Incident means saying good enough.

Because she cant sing.She cant hold a candle to any of the other Supremes singers  Jean Terrell, Lynda Laurence or Scherrie Payne  thats why she tried to stop them from using the Supremes name  but lost because she didnt own the name!Every once in a while an unknown producer will come along and offer her a recording deal  usually the company will go out of business like her last release  and thats the end of that. This is one of those examples. The song is awful, the voice is awful, and you can tell it was recording using a oneman computer generated program instead of real instruments.Low budget. Look elsewhere. There are many great vocalists out there  like her former partners  the Former Ladies of The Supremes who can sing circles around Mary Wilson."

0,"This book ends prematurely This book is a fresh take on Henry Stanley and well worth the read. However, the book ends right after his second exploration, quite literally. For a book that poured over Stanleys early years, many pages to his  and under years, the paragraph literally that sums up his knighthood, authoring of more books, marriage and subsequent adventures is pretty disconcerting. It is like the author died and someone else tacked on an ending and called it done."

Is this fun? What the hell is wrong with you? Yeah its just a movie, and a stupid one at that with a plot that couldve been scripted by a crackhead or a yr old, but at the end of the day its just a movie. The ending is predictable. Freddy is annoying with his villiany and Jason is just some retard with a machete. I was in a theater with a bunch of teenagers cheering everytime somebody got wacked on screen. Theres just something terribly twisted about that.This isnt horror, theres no suspense, theres absolutely no plot and the only catharsis comes when someone gets predictably killed. The fight between Jason and Freddy in the end is short and dull. I await the coming of an actual horror film, not this trash."

Do not believe any of them. Notice how they are ambiguous and the reviewers have never reviewed anything else on Amazon. These idiots probaly havent even listened to this vapid garbage but get points and free stuff for writing these fake star reviews. Ashlee has no real fans and Geffen has to sink this low just to get people to believe this girl is actually good."
0,"Poor Quality Cologne Paul Sebastian By Paul Sebastian For Men, Cologne  OuncesI have been using PS Cologne for over  years. I recently ordered some from Amazon when I noticed their discounted price.The cologne arrived either over its expiration date or after it was exposed to extreme temperatures.There was a faint scent overpowered by an alcohol odor.Amazon credited my card immediately without question. Thank you Amazon. No thanks to the supplier."
0,"Boooo! The first Jaws was greatmost of the sequels were really, really bad. I like the idea of the giant great white shark attacking Sea World. However, thirtyfive feet is a little bit bigger than the original  feet, but whos counting? The underwater aquarium which is literally underwater is ridiculous. How are you supposed to get down there in the first place? Stairs? Elevator? Electricity doesnt really work underwater. How do they have lights lighting the aquarium? What if Jaws gets near it? Duh. Well, anyway, the part where Jaws attacks the main control room of the submerged aquarium is really, really fake. If you like Jaws, this is good. If you want a good shark movie, see the original or Deep Blue Sea."
0,"Soft Porn Ive read all of the Anita Blake books up to and including this one as well as  of the next one, Cerulean Sins which I wont finish. I did finish this book but was not excited about continuing the series. I felt that the original storyline created books ago was lost and muddled and this book was all about sex. Not that that cant be exciting when you are ready for it but if I wanted to read this much sex, Id get the appropriate magazine. Anybody can write about sex. It takes a great author to create a great storyline and finish and add to that storyline with every new book in the series. This series has lost its appeal to me and after mucking through half of the next book, Ive decided to stop and move on to a different author."
0,"A Big Disappointment This author does a half... job at tearing down the accomplishments of social science  particularly sociology. He often fuses ideas of the individual psychology and the social reformers I suppose he means sociologists. Moreover, while it appears that his sources are abundant his examinations at best are remedial. This work is the epitome of the kind of subjective methodology one can expect from scholars of history. I found his work to be completely bias and often times contradictory."
0,"Dont bother I picked up this book hoping that the author recognized the glut of books with the theme of, Keep your chin up and youll soon get married and live happily ever after and instead write a book for those who are satisfied with their lives and just looking for some advice on how to address the people and situations in life that assume youre incontent.I was sorely disappointed. They can keep the money I paid for this book, I just want my time back."
0,"the book was not credible reading. I have read just about half of the book, but it doesnt take long to realize that the author is no fan of Hillary Clinton. The book is so biased and mean spirited that it loses its credibility. Anyone who has ever opened up a newspaper and actually reads it, knows that there have been plenty of problems with the current occupants of the White House, however some good things have also occured during their term of office. She has repeated every rumor and innuendo that has ever been printed and spoken about the Clintons, from Hillarys lesbianism to her affair with Vince Foster, I do believe there is a conflict here, to drug dealing and everything in between. No where have I found anything that sounded vaguely like a compliment. What happens when an author is so critical about their subject is that they lose all their credibility. When I finish this book and I will, put it where it deserves to be, IN THE GARBAGE PAIL."
0,"Brittle While this blades cut was super accurate, I was disappointed that after only using it one time the inner diameter teeth that connect to the Fein tool crumbled. Theres still a few left so its usable just have to be careful. And this blade is expensive too."
0,"Sometimes base and vulgar, yet funny This set of cartoons are mostly sarcastic, sometimes base and vulgar, revealing, for what cartoons can reveal, and yet even funny, that is if one can get past the afronting style of the writers. I would not recommend this for children."
0,It sucks! I bought this product thinking it would work well but it doent. It doesnt cut hair close and it doesnt cut hair when wet like it says it does. If I could take it back I would. Im not a very hairy guy either. I take image how poorly it would work on someone really hairy. Use a razor instead. Disapointed!
0,"VooDoo Dooh This game was one big fat dud. Graphics were okay, camera and controls were atrocious just like the other reviewer said. This game does not have replaybility. It is maybe worth  video rental to chalk down what you do not like about this game. There are much better platformers out there this year. No excitability here. My kids even asked me to turn this off."
0,"bland Bland writing, contrite characters, and cliched plot line. I thought, if there is going to be such a whirl wind romance, at least make it worth my time. I couldnt care less if they ended up together or not. The whole mermaid chair myth had no point. I was hoping for something diffrent, beautiful even, with the name The Mermaids Chair, and all I got was a hardcover book full of nonsense....and stupid people doing stupid things without true objectives....not worth even paperback price."
0,Its not wittyIts tedious I love foreign films.I get the British humor where most people dont.I like intellectual movies.But this one just stinks.Even the most talented U.K actors cant save this.Gawwwd!It is bloody awful.Gag.Only recommended for insomniacs.
0,"Strontium   Police Academy Ark  Anyone remember Mike Howlett?He was bassist for the band Gong until he left in .Within that same timespan he just happen to bring together an unknown singer we now know as Sting together with drummer Stewart Copeland and guitarist Andy Summers to play on his demo.Strontium  was a short lived band but they did manage to perform at a large hippie festival in Paris in May, where the three live tracks on this release was taped,Three OClock Shot,Electron Romance and Lady Of Delight.The ONLY Police cut on here youre likely to recognize is Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic.The only other decent tunes here are Visions Of The Night and Towers Tumbled because they do feature Stings trademark vocals.I was pretty dissapointed with Police Academy mostly for the reason is that it just SEEMS that it couldve been so much better.On the upside,however if you happen to be a MAJOR Police nut,you may very well enjoy it.Nice cover,though."
0,Not worth it! My son received this car for Christmas. It worked the first time we used it but we noticed that if we forgot to switch the car to the OFF position when we were done the batteries would die. Each time my son wanted to use the car we would have to replace the betteries! The last time we tried to use it we changed the batteries in the car and the remote and it wont work. So now its garbage!
0,"Not what I expected Robe isnt very lush or thick. It is cotton and terry, but fades quickly in the wash and becomes less burgundy and more pinkish wine. I wouldnt recommend buying for a man unless hes ok with wearing pink.Some of the stitching isnt done right either, as there is fraying on the outside of some of the side seams. Ive had it for less than  hours, and washed it once.It ends up looking rather cheap."
0,"copy controlled caca be careful who you buy this CD from  at least some versions come on a CD which has been copy protected in some way that makes it hard or impossible to use on your computer, convert for use on your mp player, and may not even work with your ordinary CD player according to some of the web sites Ive seen."
0,"An Insult to the Original Series The original series was a cool Saturday morning scifi show that the whole family could enjoy. This movie is a wasteland of bathroom humor, sexual jokes with even an Fbomb thrown in. Sid and Marty Croft should be ashamed of themselves. I am so happy that this movie was the worst bomb of the year! FYI, I have no problem with adult humor, but I do have a problem with them taking kids shows and converting them to fart and sex comedy fests."
0,"horrible quality Besides the book being a bunch of horrible jokes. Possibly the rejects of laffy taffy jokes yes that bad the binding was broke, the front cover looked like it had been bent in half for years, and there was scribbles and writing on dozens of the pages"
0,"Boring. I was hoping this would continue the characters of the previous book. Rather, it was a really odd mix of new characters, and seems it has nothing to do with the original world of book . Actually, I just stopped reading it after about  pages, skimming the rest. It didnt hold my attention at all."
1,"Good Buy I enjoy playing this with my son, helping him out. The good thing is you never have to buy books anymore. You can just place the tiles on the board and go at your own pace. The only downside is that you cant travel with it. The game does come with some setups. The setups do take some time and can get a little confusing but not bad at all."
1,"It started here! One of Judas Priests most memorable album. Breakin The Law, Grinder, Livin After Midnight, and other rockin tunes can be found. This album made me want to learn to play the guitar! From the minute I heard it, I knew thats what I wanted to do. Im sure many others feel the same way. A MUST for any rockin CD collection!"
1,"Works well Parker  Calligraphy Gift Set, Four Nib Selections, Six Ink Cartridges, Blue, Black, RedBought this set to address wedding invitations...great starter set for a novice who wanted to try her hand at the art of calligraphy."
1,"Fun product We bought this for our preteen daughter so she could put an ironon decal on it, personalizing it. It was perfect for the purpose, and she loved it.The only glitch we encountered was the material is thicker than Tshirt material so when we followed the ironon decal instructions and machine washed it after applying the decal, the decal began to come off. However, that was not a problem from the bag itself. Solution sew a pocket on top and put on another decal....just this time, dont wash it! The bag has held up quite well!"
1,"Works like a charm, but cheap and flimsy construction I purchased this ADAPTER its not a voltage converter! for a trip through France so that I could charge my iPod and use a hair dryer. It worked perfectly. Just be gentle with it because they used cheap plastic construction. Also, one of the adapters within the adapter fits inside the unit you can see it in the product picture, at the top near the USB plug, and must be removed for use. This creates the possibility of losing it. However, in all fairness, it works. This adapter even accepts the US prong grounded plugs. I also like the indicator lights that tell you when its functions are working. The only reason I did not give it  stars is its flimsy and cheap construction. Otherwise it gets the job done. Again, its an ADAPTER, NOT A VOLTAGE CONVERTER."
1,"A Muslim Response I write this as a Muslim, who was born in the US, studied traditional knowledge in Eygpt, and believes in intellectual revival of Islam through spiritual and political revival.This book sheds light on the problem of Muslims from many different angles. It also shows the frustration many Muslims feel throughout the world. It is a book on the reflection of how our government has lumped all types of Practicing Muslims in one catagory. It forces the Muslims to think what is my jihad in a sense I never thought that the jihadi movements lack soo much discipline, knowledge, and the true Islamic spirit. The worst of it was how Muslims who were supposedly involved in Jihad were saying things, without meaning it.This book is a wake up call for the Muslims, every Muslim should read,and every Non Muslim should read it. I especially think people in authrority should read this book."
1,"wicked, different sounding, great Sorry... dont care a piss about the RozzValor debate. I just listen to the music and call it how it is. This one is very inventive with the range of odd instruments used, and I like the concept Nostradamus... that wild and crazy guy. I have to say, I bought Iron Mask once, long before, and thought it royally sucked. These guys... Valors Christian Death?  times better..."
1,"Paint Shop ProPossibly the best graphics editor! I rated Paint Shop Pro a , because it is vaguely hard to learn. I began by going to jasc.com i think it was and downloading the  day trial version. I then went to other websites featuring animated tutorials and learned how to create various backgrounds for use on webpages, image effects, and etc. My friend and I used PSP to create logos for shirts, which we may one day decide to sell. Its really a great program to make anything from webpage dividers to tshirt logos and anything in between! I know i said it was semihard to learn, but thats for advanced website backgrounds. All in all its a fairly simple program to use and i HIGHLY reccomend it.Hope this helped someone!"
1,Great Show! Good behind the scenes interviews  just wish that it had some filming bloopers. I appreciate the fact how the development of the show really makes the show come alive. It also gives greater appreciation for the show. Cant wait for future seasons to be released.
1,Best knife ever These are so easy to use and feel like an extension of your hand. Light and sharp. I have been a fan of fine cutlery for over  years and was so glad when I bought my first Shun. This knife set makes a great addition to my collection.
1,summer house Charming story of a friendship between an older woman with a past and a repressed younger woman who fears being trapped in a conventional life. The character Lily Jeanne Moreau is unforgettable. Excellent British cast. Similar in feeling to Tea With Mussolini and Enchanted April.
1,"Something for everyone What I like the best about this DVD is it gives you a bunch of pieces to mix and match in a way that suits your needs. From beginner to expert, from a half an hour to three hours, drills to conditioning to choreography, you can mix and match sections to meet your needs. It is an excellent supplement to in class work. I belong to a troupe, and I use it to make my drilling and conditioning work i do on my own more interesting and effective."
1,"successful book My criticism would be that people with emotional problems with Gods grace can still be good spouses. On the other hand, it certainly helps make the marriage easier and with a higher probability of success to marry someone who is emotionally welladjusted!A great book to help young adults to look at themselves and their relationships so they will have healthy marriages and families."
1,"Outstanding! I am a career firefighter and have seen far too many examples of weak leadership. I figured the seals were a rather successful organization to look into. Although our jobs are different, there are many parallels. This is a great book for anyone who works in a team enviroment and wants to make their organization more successful."
1,"Good Sequel This movie picks up right where the first one left off. If you liked the first one or you are a Sandra Bullock fan then you will like this movie. It is every bit as strong as the first one if not stronger, not to mention entertaining."
1,"New Trend in Haitian Music I heard the album and I found it so fascinating that you can have so much diversity in Haitian music. The artist lets his heart speak and goes deeply into Haitian roots but with the soul of jazz which, we know, is our voodoo cousin."
1,"Hang It! This is a veratile hanger of fairly solid metal that can be used for numerous hanging purposes in addition to its decription for hanging a ladder. Two long wood screws are furnished to mount the hanger on studs  apart. This is an easy installation process which would be even simpler if you were to bore a small pilot hole before driving the screws.I took away one star because the screw holes in the hanger are very small and there are only two of them. This limits the amount of weight that this hanger could accomodate. A second set of holes could easily have been provided to increase the weight capability and to provide more firmness to the mount. However, for hanging reasonably light items such as a six foot ladder, for example, this will sufffice.This product was made in China. Had I known that when making the purchase I would have searched for a hanger made in the USA."
1,"On the Bedside Table My brotherinlaw recommended this book to me. It turns out, it came into both of our lives at just the right time. The chapter headings take on the real questions in life and the mixture of historical quotes, authors perspective and modern prayer are truly delightful. I like that it is not preachy. My edition sits on the bedside table, but is often tucked in my suitcase alongside my journal when I hit the road. It offers a sense of inspiration and opens me up to thinking about faith differently. You dont need to be heady or theological to get the power of the diverse perspectives. Just enjoy it."
1,"Very heavy duty clothes rack Nice QUALITY clothes rack, easy to move around and holds a week of clothes for . Only thing I wish the bar had a longer pole, so when I am hanging clean clothes, as I wash them, I could keep the dirty ones in bottom of the bag but they touch the dirty ones if I do that."
1,"Love it!! My daughter developed her love of reading thanks to Junie B. She has had hours of fun reading and writing and drawing in this journal! Worth every penny, I wish Barbara Park would create another one."
1,"Scope in Scholarship and Humanity, the New York kind A deep sense of New York, in history and character. If you have a New York bookshelf, this one goes next to Gotham A History of New York City. Caldwell is the lucid confidant, the trusted guide, the designated keyholder, even when the night gets hysterical."
1,"Must have for any teachers teaching social studies I use several clips from this DVD for my social studies lesson with rdth graders... Its engaging, historically accurate and educational. Much better than other historical films that are often dry. It includes a diverse historically significant figures that are sometime forgotten in the text book. LOVE this DVD series. I enjoy watching it in my own time too. A must have for any teachers from elementary to high school teaching social studies."
1,"A rare pleasure This book gets my highest praise. I did not think anyone was writing like this anymore. It could almost have been written in the era in which the action takes place, the s, since Mason seems to give voice to the best of human feeling and language missing in modern writing.I was in Burma and Thailand recently, not too far from places described in the book. Mason paints a picture faithful to the depth of texture and richness of place.I wonder how many modern readers will have what it takes to appreciate this book."
1,Must Have Album of the Year The lyrics are tight. The beats are bangin. Any Eminem fan who has been craving more Eminem material needs to get this album. You can tell that D had fun making this album and it is sure to ruffle some feathers.
1,"Not for casual listening While I know this isnt Bowies catchiest album, for me it is emotionally, the one that has the most meaning. I know at the time he put this out he said he was trying to make music for his generation instead of trying to cater to the usual pop main stream. It is an album whos lyrics are filled with thoughtful ambiguity. The musical style is quiet and ponderous, for the most part, supporting the same in the lyrics.Without going too far into my own personal reasons for loving this album so much, I will say it is what I put in my cd player when I need to find my way out of a mental crisis. The lyrics are always giving me new meanings and as I grow older I first bought this when it came outwhich was my first year of college I find myself coming closer and closer to the material that Bowie presented.This was my first David Bowie album and Ive never regretted owning this."
1,"Back in the day music If you need a moment to remember the slower times, a time when love songs held a hint of mystery and kept you coming back for more. If youre looking to put your feet up and just relax into some great memories or create new ones. This CD will definitely do it all for you, especially if you are a fan of Barry White and the Love Unlimited Orchestra. What a masterful mix of sounds.If youre trying to put a little fire in your relationship and need to set a mood with good music, heres the music to play."
1,"A Must Have Book for Flight Attendant Interviews I ordered this book hoping that it would give me hints and insights towards getting into one of the most competitive and challenging careers. I have had only one interview in the last  years and felt I needed guidance in order to compete effectively. This book is great! It is both a guide and is essential for the Flight Attendant interview. It is written clearly, is easy and fun to read, and is an inspiration for us that want to get into this career. Oh yes, I was invited to training by  airlines. Thanks for such a great professional resource."
1,"Lots more than hamburger The reviewer who felt that all the hamburger recipes were the same didnt try the recipes that I did. I thought there was a big variety of hamburger choices, besides lots of other meat recipes that are fast to fix. My family was happy with the way the recipes tasted and I dont think youll find as complete a protein cookbook anywhere."
1,"A GOOD READ. The book is an interesting read. The monsters were a little off kilter for me, but the main character monster was pretty good. I enjoyed reading this book and I think you will too. Thanks."
1,Very Good!! Makes you want to be more like Christ!!!! Chuck Swindoll does a great job in this book! It amkes you want to get a way from you secular things and go live for Christ !!! One of the best books i have read!
1,"it was ok I really liked Family Guy when it first came out. However, after watching the DVDs of the first couple of seasons within just a few days, it wasnt too tough to figure out the patternblueprint for this show. Now I feel its pretty predictable. Still, I longed for those days when it was fresh and I really liked it. Heard about this one and got it, hoping that it was something old, which had never been aired. While it wasnt that, it was a bit more creative than the Family Guys of late and I did have a few good laughs.If youre a fan, I think youll like it. I liked it, although I wouldnt watch it again and am glad that I rented rather than bought it."
1,"good product, impossible vendor product itself is fine, but I would not order it from this vendor. I received the wrong item with a label saying it was the correct item. After many phone calls I finally received the correct item plus was invited to print out a UPS label for returning the incorrect item. And guess what  I had to drive the package to a UPS place  pickup wouldve cost me an extra some dollars. I was so furious by this time that I just took the return to UPS to be rid of the whole thing. This morning I get yet another correct grill cover, with no phone number on the invoice. I think Ill just donate it to some worthy group."
1,"Awesome lil thang! After a long time now I finally decided I wanted an Ipod. At first, I was looking at a nano but decided that the Ipod video was the best priced system. I had previously owned a creative mp player which turned out to be junk and the sound quality was terrible. You could only play music on that, but with the Ipod video, you could not only listen to mps but watch videos and view photos and play games downloaded from iTunes. If youre going to get an Ipod, I highly recommend getting this Ipod over the Ipod nano because it seems to be cheaper and you get GB for  on the Ipod video while you get GB for  on the nano. I would recommend getting a protective case for the Ipod video. A friend told me that they can be easily scratched. You can usually get one for under  at Walmart."
1,"This remote rocks! This remote is fantastic I have it controlling  devices and it handles everything smoothly and consistently. The Help feature is easy to use and truly helpful. The RF features are not what I was expecting  the information given by Logitech is sketchy at best  and it turns out the RF is not helpful now, but maybe with updatesupgrades it will be in the future. I would definitely recommend this remote however if RF is not required, I would go for the Harmony ."
1,"Best Keurig Cup so far.... We have tried a few different brands of coffee for the keurig maker, but we like this brand and blend the best so far...We were not initially attracted to this brand because we had never heard of it before, but it is quality coffee."
1,"Perfect size I bought the Corelle Hearthstone square red dinnerware, and these are a perfect accessory for a little fruit or cucumber salad to go with a meal. As reported by someone else, the color isnt an exact match, but close enough for your guests not to notice."
1,"The best earth friendly dishwasher soap Ive found I had been using Cascade for years and have to admit that I love it. When I wanted to start using something more earth friendly, I tried Seventh Generation products. I didnt like the way Seventh Generation washed the dishes at all. Ecover works well. Definitely not as good as Cascade. I continue to use Ecover though because it is more important to have a clean world than shiny clean pans. I would recommend rinsing your pans well before putting them in the dishwasher."
1,"wow I saw this book in my brothers room a while back and since Ive been doodling pretty pathetically in most of my classes, i figured it might do me some good to take a look at this book. it is amazing!! Ive never been a great artist, but this book has shown me how to draw teh marvel characters and I can apply some of that knowledge now to my other doodles. DEFINITELY get it!!!!"
1,"Truly A Caldecott Classic Owl Moon by Jane Yolen in my opinion is one of the best Caldecott Award winning books. This story of a young girl and her first owling trip with her father on a cold winter night is one that will touch the hearts of all ages. Excellently written the reader is led into the exact place the author had intended. The emotions and hopes felt by the young girl are transferred from the pages into our own minds.... Readers feel and see as if we too were on our very first trip. Booklovers and others alike are captivated by the outstanding illustrations in each page created by John Schoenherr. The love of a family, the innocence of a child, and the respect for nature all come to life on these short pages in an excellent piece childrens ofliterature. Owl Moon truly is a deserving book to be had of any young reader and will remain a classic for generations to come."
1,STAR ALL THE WAY. This is an Amazon Purchase of a GREAT Al Jolson Selection of his music. It is truely a  Star Album. It is clear and easy to listen and dance too. I carry it with me every where I go. Me
1,"Awesome Crumb was definitely the perfect illustrator for this book. Wow! The stories are broken down and visually interpreted, which really enriches the reading experience of the actual stories later if you choose to do so. Overall, a very interesting look inside the life of a mysterious, darkminded writer that most people dont know too much about. Im really glad I read this book, I learned a lot!"
1,"Remarkable Descriptions You simply have to love language to enjoy this book. Hawthorne could describe a character picking hisher nose and transform it into something beautiful and illuminating of the whole human condition. I especially like this Life is made up of marble and mud. And, without all the deeper trust in a comprehensive sympathy above us, we might hence be led to suspect the insult of a sneer, as well as an immitigable frown, on the iron countenance of fate. What is called poetic insight is the gift of discerning, in this sphere of strangely mingled elements, the beauty and the majesty which are compelled to assume a garb so sordid. It might be good for todays students to cut away from their tweeting and texting to contemplate, and attempt to translate, that sentence into a modern statement."
1,Good stuff! Michael Wallis is the premier research for Route  and anything he puts out about the road should not be missed. Disc  and Disc  particularly have good information. I felt like Disc  was something he put out because he some leftover footage from the first disc and needed some extra money. But I watched anyway because he did visit some places that werent on the first one. Group this DVD set with his book and the map set and youre ready to hit the road.
1,Inspiring An inspiring memoir full of famous personalities from sports and politics. Lous humble beginnings and deeprooted faith in family and religion took him to the top of the college football world and into the circles of many of Americas most famous leaders. This is quite a guy.
1,"Get the other Electronics books too ! Im an ex submariner and a former st class Electronics technician. I went through both ET A and ET B school at the Naval training center at the Great Lakes base in Illinois. If you want to study and learn Electronics there are  books you need...this one Basic electricity  you need to master this before you study the next  books which are Basic electronics  this is virtually the identical material used in the Navys  week ET A School and then the Advanced electronics book  this one is the ET B school curriculum I believe all  are available here at Amazon. The Navy did an incredibly good job with this material as its core of their electronics schools which by the way, were taught by civilian electrical engineers from the staff of the university of Chicagos electrical engineering dept.If you can master the material in these books you could easily stand toe to toe with any Electronics engineering college graduate anywhere"
1,"Live in current U.S. Car theft capitol Fresno Calif.. This is the nd Wrap I own. Easy to mount and dismount. Highly visible. Fairly certain to lead the piece of crap car thief to someone elses vehicle. Remote control onoff switch bigbulky and difficult to put on a key ring because of a small pass through hole. Also goes through batteries fast if you turn it on for the flashing light and alarm. Best to get rechargable batteries, youll save a bundle in the long run and be green."
1,"A great product from a great House I have come to trust Hamilton Beach for nearly all my kitchen appliances toaster, grill, food processor, etc this coffeemaker is no exception, especially with the commercial designation. It is fast, yields a ample amount, as least for my purposes, and, unlike the previous reviewers experience, is plenty hot. The pot is substantial, brushed steel and of a good weight, and the whole unit has a squat, durable feel. A nice addition to any kitchen, in terms of fashion and functionality."
1,"Gripping! I was enthralled immediately and absorbed through out the book. Its a fascinating, well told story which was even more interesting because its historically accurate. I read a lot and havent read a book I liked this much in a long time. Its just a great read."
1,"Their best This album is effortless, supercharged with energy and great songs, blasting away thru experimental textures and great lyrical idioms pride no longer has definition... crush my calm you cassevetes. Unfortunately, it gets a bit soggier in the middle w the  minutes of feedback ending  Beats Off flowing into the rather limp instrumental Sweet  Low. Other than that, this record is beyond incredible  its unique. Id buy it for Facet Squared, Smallpox Champion, Public Witness Program and Great Cop alone."
1,"Travelers Handbook Rules! This book was very informative. We are planning an around the world trip next year and this book created a great starting point with many chapters to stimulate your thinking. We really enjoyed the listing of all the countries with information on when to travel, safety, and visas required. It also provided local phone numbers and addresses around the world to reach incase of an emergency. We will definitely bring this book on our travels!"
1,"You cant live without this book, but you have to study it. This book is the most important book I have ever read. The methods for helping your child sleep are fantastic. The only problem is that the book is so poorly written that you need to read it several times in order to get ALL the important info out. If you dont spend the extra time with it you may miss vital information, such as this method should create very little or no crying if you pay attention to your child and the clock. This method truly help make HAPPY BABIES.Careful Reading"
1,"superbly written I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in spinor calculus. The authors primary goal is to investigate the problem of defining Lie and covariant differentiation of spinor fields. This they do, but in addition, they carefully cover a number of standard topics and a number that Id not seen elsewhere such as the decomposition of a connection into constituents including the contorsion  metricincompatibility tensors in an extremely lucid way."
1,"Sherries Amazing Reviewing Eveballs for Breakfast is a very realistic book that deals will the daily events of a childs life. It is very entertaining to read.

1,"Great book, one to remember for life. I read this book when I was in th grade and I loved it so much I read it a couple more times. I am now  years old and I have been looking for it eversince. I was shopping at a Borders store with my best friend and I found a copy. She also has been looking for it because it was the only book she has ever enjoyed reading in her entire lifeshe is not a book fan. Give this book to your kids, they will remember it for life."
1,"No Bloodsuckers Here! Once I got started, I could not put this book down! I started on a Friday evening and finished it at am Monday morning. This book is excellent and a total and completely different spin on vampires. I love Anne Rice but she has nothing on Tananarive Due! The Living Blood is truly an original. Well written, wonderfully paced. Just a fabulous book! And there better be a sequel!!!!Thank you Tananarive Due! Were definitely Due for more from you!!!"

I wanted to have a gate that was high enough for my lil puppy to not jump over and was not too hard for me to move freely through the space,and this was the one! I read a few other reviews which made me decide to buy this gate. Although it says its for children if you have a small dog under about lbs, this will owrk for u too. I even bumped into it accidently and it stayed pretty much in place.It is lil tricky to put together but once you get in place it was worth a lil confusion!Im Very Happy!!!"
1,"Great collection! Feliciano! remains the place to begin, but this is an ideal supplement. Soulful vocals, impressive guitar work check out the excerpt from Handels Fireworks!, fine song selection. Only two tracks Theres Always Something... and Light My Fire overlap with Feliciano!, and the selections here flow a bit better as one piece, in my opinion, than some of the greatest hits CDs. If you only know Jose Feliciano from Light My Fire and Feliz Navidad, you have some happy listening ahead!"
1,"Great Walking sneaker Love, love, love these walking sneakers. I walk my dogs several miles a day and wear them to school on Fridays when my feet are tired from standing  hours a day,  days a week. These are my second pair. Loved them so much I bought another pair. Specially designed for walkers who come down hard on their heals. They hug your feet. They run a size small. I normally take a  and need an  in these. I walk on the road,  miles a day and they lasted my a year. Great sneakers!"
1,"Dr. John wants to take you out to the swamp, sugar. Even as New Orleans slowly pokes through Le Noveau Swamp, you know Dr. John, Le Grand Zombie himself, is out there. He never left. The Grisgris Man is riding around out there in a jewel encrusted Gondola, looking like a zombie pimp in three inch cuban heels.This CD is Dr. Johns CV. It busts a funky mandolin and moves at the speed of a summertime sewer. It goes slow, you meet some strange and groovy people and sometimes it just plain gives you the junkie fear.Dont listen to it alone. Because Dr. John may come acalling with his Mojo bag.Creepy, funky, strange and beautiful music."
1,"how Long to Use for Each Filter? Brita replacement filters from amazon.com work well,but I dont know how to measure optimal usage of each filter.If I use filter too long,quality of water may decrease.If I dont use filter enough,then Im wasting filter or its not economic.Overall I prefer Brita to generic filters offered in the stores  cheaper price.Ted DeCerchio"
1,Funny! This book was one of the most amusing and shocking of all those I have read on the royals. Our worlds royals were very odd people! Very funny and very interesting. This book makes you want to continue to find out more about what some of our royals were really up to!
1,"An excellent goal I got the book when I was pregnant with my first and only child. I loved it! It gave me so much insight. Several birthing books out there made me feel a little anxious about giving birth and then hearing peoples personal stories really made me concerned. I was not sure that I could handle childbirth! But after reading this book, I felt so confident and it really helped ease my worries. However, despite my goals of having a natural, painless labor, I ended up screaming my lungs out until finally my husband convinced me to get some drugs! Oh the poor people who had to witness that! Anyway I did love labor, contrations hurt like nothing else, but when I could finally push I was so happy. I would highly reccommend this book to any pregnant women. It is so nice to read and to have a plan on how you want to give birth even if your plan ends up getting altered a little!"
1,"Its real. Its definitly real. I dont know what you guys are talking about this book being fake sounding and none of this could ever happen, but it could. Just take a look around your local high school or even middle school, its happening right before your very eyes, you are just missing it. I even know people with a similar story. How is this fake at all ? It inspires many people and teaches them about the world that drugs really is, not what it just seems to be. If you think this is fake fine, but read it anyways. It will teach you something you probably never knew before and will teacher teenagers all over about things that may seem great until looked at thoroughly. Nothing is as good as it seems and that is perceived in this book quite clearly, and should be a required read for people of all ages. I strongly reccomend it not only as a person who has read it and it helped me through some times, but as someone who wants to help you."
1,"AMAZING!!!!! This Bands music is not anything but intoxicating!!! I guarantee you that once you listen, you wont want to listen to anything else. All four of these boys are amazing musicians and the music they produce will get deep into your heart and soul and you will be hooked. Love this band!!!! Love this music!!! Best CD I ever bought!!!"
1,"great bedside book this is an outstanding book for those places where you only get a few minutes at a time to read. the bedside, the bathroom, your backpack... the author has a wonderfully wry, leftofcenter sense of humour, and is unapologetic about constructing false facts to make his almanac more interesting. that, in itself, is a wonderfully subtle statement about how people tell their own stories.the only thing that keeps this book from getting  stars is that i was hoping for a TRUE almanac, just with wittier and stranger content. that said, though, i was pleasantly surprised to find a gem of a book which finds its way into my mitts several times a week."
1,"Funimation you are a bunch of crooks! I am really glad to see they put out the entire season one at a reasonable price. What Im angry about is buying episode  to  at  bucks a pop. Then they stopped releasing them after episode  to dump the rest of the episodes in one release of the entire season one!Which means I bought  for nothing! Im buying this Funimation because I love DBZ, but I dont love YOU. This, Funimation, is the last dime you are getting out of me EVER. Ive already sent an extremely rude email to Funimation and Im not a bit sorry for the rudeness telling them, I am officially their excustomer. Maybe next time, they will consider whether ripping off their customers is the best way to keep customer loyalty."
1,"It grows on you The first couple of times I listened to this CD, I wasnt sure I liked it. The didgeridoo was cool but Xaviers voice was a bit thin and music had a strong Paul Simon sound. But a couple more listens and it has definitely improved. While Xavier doesnt have a strong voice, it is adequate and his use nonstandard instruments like the didgeridoo and sitar brings a pleasant uniqueness to his music. Keeping it all acoustic also works with his lyrics and voice. Give it a listen a couple of times. Itll grow on you."
1,Good book This is a very interesting book. Not one like many which reiterated the war so much so you felt like you were reading the same book for the umpteenth time. There are new perspectives on what hes saying here. Id recommend it for your home library if your a war buff and have true history interests.
1,"NYPD Blue Fourth Season Watching this show again made me miss the old police dramas, like this one and Hill Street Blues. Reviewers used to call them gritty, and thats a good description. It amazes me that David Caruso, and then Jimmy Smits got top billing. To me, Dennis Franz has always been the star of this series.In season , Sipowiczs son Theo is born, and we see Andy mellow just a bit. Medavoy forges a friendship with a gay female cop who asks him to become a surrogate father. Theres a lot happening in the personal lives of the whole squad.I recommend this and the other three seasons of this great show highly. My only disappointment is that out of all  seasons, only the first four are available. Come on, th Century Fox, let us buy the rest already!"
1,"Living it Mr. Sledges discription of his experiences at Peleliu  Okinawa was so gripping that I felt the emotions he felt. This book by far is the best Ive ever read at putting the reader in battle. I felt his fear....I was dirty, I was thirsty and I smelled the sickening stench of war. Well done Marine!"
1,"Best Bra ever! Okay, Ill admit my age for the purpose of this review...Im  and in the roughly  years that Ive been wearing bras now, this bra tops them all. Its a combination of fit, feel and those great straps that dont fall down. Its a light weight bra so it doesnt feel heavy on. At the end of the day, you arent aching to take it off. The micro fiber is SO soft. The tstrap is great. It doesnt itch, or irritate like some other bras of this type and you dont have those falling down straps or strapshow with sleeveless shirts. I can even wear them with tanks. Very comfortable!!"
1,"Pretty Good Sequel As a sequel to Soul of the Fire, I enjoyed the closer examination of The Imperial Order and some of the ideological implications of the book, they can definitely go beyond the pursuit of economic freedom alone. Although I must admit getting a little annoyed at the repetition in describing certain characters. I can understand the possible need for reiterating certain traits of the characters but it becomes unnecessary.The relationship between Richard and Kahlan appears as too perfect in all the series including this one, Kahlans actions in Temple of the Winds notwithstanding. Richards character is presented as likeable to the point of incredulity and at times I skipped a few lines of somewhat pretentious narration. The main characters could afford more of a blemish or two, it might make them more interesting.Now that there are troubles in the Imperial Order, I hope that the threat will come to an end."
1,"You must have this book! Its truly useful I was able to find information very quickly. Whether I needed to look up syntax or information about specific shells, I didnt have any trouble. Everything is welllocated, with the handy little tab markers on the pages, and the table of contents is wellorganized as well. The book is very inexpensive as well! I am very satisfied with this book purchase."
1,"Great story! Dont miss this fantastic summer read by Shirley Hailstock, a story with enough plot, sexual excitement and down right whodoneit to keep you reading until the very last word.Duncan West is producer for The Marsha Chambers Show, one of the biggest names in television talk shows.Aurora Alexander is the perfect double for Marsha Chambers, a career opportunity that shows promise, until it turns deadly.Add a television crew bent on doing their jobs, a police detective with his own agenda, a psycho out to harm Marsha Chambers, or so it would seem....To this mix add the perfect touch of romance between Duncan and Aurora, and you have the perfect way to spend a summers day.Loved this book!Stella"
1,"Creme de la creme Excellent selection of songs here to be placed on one recording, there are  listed tracks and all are very exquisitely rendered with the careful, melodious vocals of Sandra Cretu.The best of these are ones such as Hi Hi Hi which has a wonderful early s feel to it, and some others are remakes of hit songs from the s like Everlasting Love, which is done so masterfully well here, I cant honestly imagine anybody not liking it and giving it a thumbs down. In fact, I think I like it better than the original, thats just me. This is a beautiful product to own and the owner should be proud to have it amongst their collection.Aryan Somers"
1,"An excellent pregnancy reference book thats not too cutesy. Im a yearold woman planning to get pregnant. When I looked at other pregnancy books, I found them too cutesy for my taste. Id rather have a book that provides solid and comprehensive information in a straightforward and unsentimental manner. This book was the closest I could find in matching that criteria, and of course, the Mayo is wellrespected as a healthcare institution. Perhaps because this book is not so cutesy is why it can appeal to fathers.I found the book to be a bargain since it also offers information on the babys first year. Very wellpriced for a large hardcover reference book.As a person of color, I appreciated that the photos and drawings of parents and babies were diverse in ethnicracial representation seemed to be proportionate to the population."
1,"Bad Ass I saw them play some songs off of this album at a concert, so I was pretty excited to get the new album. I was not dissapointed at all. Their CD rocks with the same energy as their live show. It is just as good if not better then their first album. Sick of Life kicks off the CD in a big way, it is as heavy as anything from their first CD. So far I like all the songs, it would be tough to pick a favorite from all these great. If you like Godsmack or hard rock, you have to get this kick ass CD."
1,"Love it! But velcro not as tight after two months. I guess I have a strong baby. He used this swaddle since he was  months old and only for nap time. He is now  months and I have used  of them already because he manages to break if off. After  months, the two velcro are not as strong. Maybe because of the cloth started to wear out from velcro constantly tugging by my son. I wish they make  velcro taps the final wrap part so that I can use it a bit longer and maybe he cannot break it off. Now I am thinking about buying a new one but he is already  months and it is getting hotter these days in Florida."
1,"Yes, it most certainly does. If you like super heroes, underdogs, martial arts, good triumphing over evil, McLovin, comic books, graphic novels, profanity, comingofage tales, Nicholas Cage, Matthew Vaughn films, automatic weapons, bazookas, firearms in general, crude humor, hit and run accidents,Joan Jett, social media, the agony of highschool life and revenge, then BOY, is this film for you. I loved it in the theater and just bought the DVD. One of my favs of the year."
1,"way out there Townsend did a terrific job at making you feel sympathetic for the royal family. It was a fun and silly at times book that gave great insight into the life of commoners in England. Pour a good ale or bitter, sit in your favourite reading chair and have a good time. I must say that I was horribly disappointed with the weak ending. There was so much creativity flowing mph throughout the book and when I read the ending it was like hitting a cement wall. I wont spoil for you by telling you what happens!"
1,"Top notch writing and acting! This UK production dramatizes the reallife story of Staff Sergeant Caroline Meagher Helen Baxendale  Cold Feet, Unsuitable Job for a Woman tasked with investigating suspected lesbians in the British Army. The job was a difficult one as Meagher was a lesbian herself and fighting to hold onto both her job in the Army and her girlfriend Laura Fraser  Ninas Heavenly Delights, Lip Service.

1,"Average User I purchased this product along with a new LCD monitor. I had a problem connecting the DVI interface it was MY problem fleshware and I called the helped desk, during the day and got a real person who gave me a real answer that solved the problem. BTW, the video card works great also."
1,"Lowest Price available same Vit and Nutrients NOT true arrives pulverized those reviews were LIMONS, if true BUY dudes, Lowest Price available, same Vit and Nutrients compared to other similar beats, bougth one then repeated, my dog loves, inexpensive and good product man ."
1,"The new spirit of Music Switch is the debut album of a band now known as Rezound www.switchrock.com. These guys are highly talented, mixing the rhythm and intensity of bands like Linkin Park and POD with the heart and soul of bands like Lifehouse and Creed. The result is lot like Disturbed but without the profanity and with a lot more talent. Id rate them as one of the top ten bands out there, top five if you allow points for the fact they are not total sellouts. This is the new future of underground rock."
1,"Not as good as Catherine, called Birdy Though not as clever or witty as CATHERINE, CALLED BIRDY, THE MIDWIFEs APPRENTICE is a more serious and lonely story of a girl without the priveldges of a princessas Catherine has but is more down to earth and meek, making her a more delecate person to read. While I was dissapointed to find that there was no little romance story twisted in, this book was quite capable of keeping me awake."
1,"Worth a lot more than sixpence Paul Collins takes us with him as he relocates his family from San Francisco to the Welsh town of HayonWye, the little burg known for a bazillion used book stores. When he buys a yearold house, he of course suspected he might encounter a problem or two, buy yikes! He faces problems, however, not just with his home but also with his editors, his publishers, family adjustments to village mentality, etc. but the whole is more than the sum of its parts in Collins book. It can be read and enjoyed as memoir, travelogue, history, and adventure.Altogether, a good read."
1,"As A Final Note... Ive already reviewed this game, but I just have to say this was true computer entertainment! The entire game played out almost like a movie. It was so incredibly dramatic, Im having a hard time believing this!"
1,"Cheap and sweet. This headset cost practically nothing. It sounds great and works perfectly. Its also comfortable, except that it can be a little tight and hard to hear background sounds when they are on. For this price, the set is unbeatable. The quality is comparible to headsets in the    range."
1,this show is awesome This is the type of show I always look forward to watching. All the cast have great chemistry especially the  main stays. I havent bought any Psych complete season yet but I am definitely buying all the seasons once it comes out in bluray. This show is simply one of my favorite tv shows of my life and that is no joke. I highly recommend this...
1,"A Foreboding of Paganism in Christian England Lord Dunsany was one of a handful of early preTolkien fantasy authors George MacDonald and William Morris are two other important ones, whose poetic, evocative writing sets him apart. In The Blessing of Pan Dunsany tells of a village clergymans struggle with an insidious encroachment of Paganism. It reads more like a Victorian novel Dickens or Charlotte Bronte than a horror novel  its very homey, but with a sense if foreboding. It kind of reminded me of the movie The Wicker Man, in the way the Christian protagonist was faced with the to him unthinkable appearance of paganism in his comfortable Christian world. An excellent and wellexecuted book, but dont expect wild action."
1,"Great and dependable speakers. The number one plus for me these speakers have been sitting on my deck, rain, shine, snow for  years and still working great.Great soundDecent looks. Simple style so it is easy to match with many landscape.Reasonable price. Outdoor speakers are generally expensiveEasy installationYoke is adjustable to direct the speakers at some anglesTip I think it will be a good idea to weatherproof the contacts of the speaker wires to the speaker connections with something like a silicon sealant. The connections got a little corroded due to the elements and I have to cut the tip of the wires to expose the new copper and reconnect."
1,"great, fast shipping great product second in the series, still about  pages into it, so not sure why they asked me to write a review after I got the book just  hours ago...oh well, happy days...eh?"
1,"If you like carrabien music, youll love this! True, this soundtrack doesnt have much music from the film. Only tracks ,,,,, and a very hard to hear track  are heard on the film but some of the other music is great. I got this soundtrack a year ago just for the great  blind mice song. My favourite tracks are , , ,  and . Track  Twisting With James is my favourite of them all as it is a great piece of happy, dance music. The first track is the original and best version of The James Bond theme. Track  is also called The James Bond Theme perhaps it was considered to be used as the main Bond theme first. The songs  Blind Mice, Jump Up and Under The Mango Tree are classics. They are remixed and used instrumentally throughout the soundtrack. If you want all the music from Dr No, you wont find it hear but if you want easy listening, good music then get this CD. Check out my reviews of other Bond soundtracks too. And over the next month, Ill review them all."
1,"Jack Whyte does it again! Tne Authurian saga contines in Jack Whytes newest book. This tale is spun so skillfully that I constantly have to remind myself that it is fiction. It reads like a history written by someone who actually lived with Merlin, Arthur, and their ancestors. A fully enjoyable page turner!"
1,"Pamelas Baking Mix I love this stuff! I cant have any gluten and found Pamelas to have all the flavor without the bad stuff. My entire family likes it better than other brands on the market. Its a little spendy, but I havent found it cheaper anywhere than Amazon. thank You!!"
1,"AWESOME! This camera is more then I bargained for, Great x optical zoom, various picture settings. Swivel screen lets you take pictures like your operating a video camera. Video also comes out very clear and sound is great. I would give it  stars execpt for  things... . It comes with a measly mb sd card, which can hold about  pictures or about  sec of video. So I would suggest a  or g card. . I would suggest buying good quality NiHm recargeable batteries, It will be cheaper in the long run. Overall, execelent!"
1,YEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!! This is the most brutal album recorded. It is up there with Cannibal Corpses Eaten Back To Life and Panteras Far Beyond Driven. Oh Aaron is the sickest lyrics ever. He should go on tour with the Corpse!!!
1,"An excellent CD I believe that this is the best copy of American Pie that I have in my collection. Being a Don Mclean fanatic, Im always looking for a good condition record at estate sales and auctions, but with this I have all the hits and none of the scratches!"
1,"HIS BEST ALBUM This legendary album contains at least four classics Rubylove with its prominent bouzouki and verses sung in Greek is atmospheric and beautiful Morning Has Broken sounds like a medieval hymn, a gentle lilting ballad with spiritual undertones Moonshadow is a moving and melodic love song, while Peace Train, though less immediate, will grow on you. I dont know if Cat Stevens can be considered a heavyweight in the singersongwriter genre, but he certainly reached a creative peak with these beautiful compositions. Never quite as melancholy as Nick Drake, nor as psychedelic as Donovan, Stevens touched all the right chords here with these simple but timeless songs, the sparse backing and his lovely vocals. This is definitely his best album and the music has stood the test of time very well."
1,"Silly Stanley I liked the book. If I was  again, this book would have turned me into an anthropology major. Plus, I like people named Stanley. Great name, dont you think. HEY, STANLEY! Oh, Stanley Stanley, can I speak with you a minute? Has a nice ring to it. Anyway, I just wish he would have addressed why on earth dont people have fur? Most other mammals do, unless they spend a lot of time in the water. We do have a lot of hair on our heads. Maybe we evolved only partially in the water with just our heads stickn out? Though men have fur on their faces. Figures, poor Lucy had to keep her face in the water looking for fish, Ricky jr. hanging on her hair while Big Ricky prostrates with our other male ansestors staying just out of reach of that nasty sabar tooth tiger. Some things never change! Who knows? Wish I did."
1,"This stuff constantly outperforms the new products on the market... Why pay more for a poorly performing marketing stunt? Just get this stuff and be done with it. If you are an extreme overclocker, then you arent reading this, youre reading ocforums or overclockers.net or other benches and reviews for thermal compound. For everyone else... get this.Thanks,Anthony"
1,"One of the best Firesteels available These are one of the best firesteels out there. I bought a variety of them, and this one performs great. Of all the units I purchased, only the Light My Fire ARMY model compares with this unit for ease of use, and mega amounts of sparks. The Aurora unit throws plenty of sparks  if you use a steel from the Light My Fire unit that is. The Aurora unit has a tiny little blade to strike with. Try using the Aurora in the dark.. I did, and it didnt work out too well it was a real struggle to use under dark conditions. The UST Strike Force is EASY to use, and so is the LMF ARMY model. The Aurora has a nice waterproof housing, but you need to add a good steel to it and then it will work a LOT better. Hope this helps!"
1,"Beautiful!!! I really like this doll! Its very lovely! Her golden hair is so pretty and I love butterflies. I need to get this doll and then Ill almost have all of the Masquerade Madness colection. I really dont mean to brag but here are the ones I already have City Kitty Madison, Mermaid Diva Chelsea, Rocker Girl Nolee, Dream Genie Delancey...And these are the ones I need to get Party Pad, I live in Canada so it comes with Madison which I already have drat!, Butterfly Punk Barbie, Disco Derby Kenzie, and the silver convertible, the guys are nice but I wont get them cause I dont have enough dough re mi PStop the My Scene Bratz conflict!Thanx for reading!

1,"One of the Best Root Beers, but not the best. My girlfriend and I did a taste test on about  different bottled root beers including Virgils, Stewarts, Soix City, IBC, and Birkoff among others. Goose Island is, no doubt, a very good Root Beer, and probably ranks in the top  of the  we tried. However, if your in Chicago looking for Root Beer in Dominicks or Jewel, I would recommend reaching for Birkoffits cheaper and tastes better and its probably one of the best Root Beers if not the best in the country. But Birkoffs tap in the restaurant is even better."
1,"Brian Wilson in turmoil I remember listening to this album when I was fifteen years old and it intrigued me because it wasnt a sunny California type album, but there were moments I really loved. It was more of a winters day piece with songs like Wind Chimes and Whistle In confusing me but staying with me for a long time. Twenty years later I bought the CD and I realise what a brilliant, if uneven, bit of work this is. The harmonies are first rate and some of the ideas are out there but demands patience. If only the unreleased Smile was a reality, the course of rock history could have changed in . The alternate takes of Good Vibrations see the mad genius Brian Wilson in full flight. See what you think!"
1,"Remarkably Well Made You know this series is much like Buffy the Vampire Slayer or Disney TV series Gargoyles in that the plot or episode synopsis can make it sound so off the wall sometimes it seems hard to take it seriously. So any new comers should keep that in mind. Its really not as far fetched as it sounds. Its a remarkably well made TV series and they spared no expense on makeup, costumes, even the music for the show was big screen worthy.This series has been a cult hit for  years now, and for good reasons. Anyone who loves fairy tales, Shakespeare, or mythology and maybe a dash of Law and Order will really enoy this.Ron Perlman is FABULOUS as the Beast, and Linda Hamilton makes a wonderfully brilliant Beauty. Even though she needs to be resuced by her Beast sometimes, she still comes off as a very strong female protagonist.Even Disney BATB fans wouldnt be disapointed with this series if theyve never seen it before.I hope the DVD release does the series justice."
1,"A star read! This book is a wonderful addition to the Ender series. This book follows up on Bean a person who has Antons Key turned inside him. This book is a great book to cuddle up with and to enjoy. Even if you do not like sciencefiction, it is a great book by a very good author, Orson Scott Card."
1,"Waiting for the italian version... I bought this set for two reasons to be able to finally see at work my then new Bluray player and because also loving this series, despite the passing of the years, there is not even a whisker of an Italian version, although at the time Firefly was broadcast on pay per view italian channels.For the rest, there is little to say, the events narrated in the series are well known, the quality of the product, as well, and I am grateful that  not being a native English speaker  can I obtain the subtitles that are, as always, of a high standard."
1,"HEY BABY! I first heard this album back in the late s while stationed in Naples, Italy. One of those albums where every song is great. My favorite though is Hey Baby! Turns out this is the only Nugent album I own. I have never seen him in concert though I enjoy listening to him when hes on the tube or on the radio. Man, can he talk fast!"
1,"A good book for subway lovers My sons really like this book, mainly because its hard to find books about subways and the kids who love them! The artist does a good job showing how it looks and feels to be on the subway. The writing is a little tough for young kids to understand, howeverthe message about divorce is pretty much lost on my  and  year old, but maybe this book is aimed a bit older kids."
1,Great! This backpack is better than the original one for the My First LeapPads. This goes with the new school bus LeapPad. It will hold the LeapPad plus at least  bookscartridges. A musthave if you dont want all of the accessories all over your house. This keeps everything together in one place. Great for traveling too.
1,Works great. Westinghouse  Channel Wireless Intercom  WHICWe plugged one unit in on the second floor of the house and one in the main bedroom on the first floor and they worked perfectly. We were expecting problems after reading the reviews because of the age of the house wiring. We have had no problems with the units just our ancient wiring in the house. We like the units and are happy with them. They are perfect for what we wanted them for.
1,"Bionicle It works well on our window xp professional.My thirteen year old twin boys really enjoy it.It has great graphics and lots of action.The player is able to play all seven of the Toa,and also gets to fight the Rahkshi,Bohrok,Bohrokal and more."
1,"Very intriging album. Timeless. This album sounds as fresh and relevant  years later as it did when it was released. The sounds, lyrics and overall feel of the album is very interesting. Quite an assortment of songs. Very flavorful."
1,"Great protein Lets face itAfter a good workout WHEY protein is what you need  nothing else.This product is relatively reasonably priced considering the ingredients and its definitely worked for me.I work out daily and take  protein shakes in addition to  meals a day I have tried pretty much ALL Whey proteins, but this one seems to give me the best resultsTo all insiders  no issues with excessive gas here! Top product which I will continue to use."
1,"Better still... As the amount of decent songs on albums goes, this one is on the upper end. Even though the hard rock edgyness appears to have mellowed, the ballads and lyrics on this album shows a progressive maturity associated with guitar licks and drum beats to match that is reminders of a great rock time gone by...one to definately add to any collection."
1,Good book but left me wanting more. This book was well written and explained the real mystery and meaning of the Dead Sea Scrolls. The history of how they were found and the politics behind the release of information by the discoverers and the experts studying the scrolls themselves. It is sad to think that politics and ego seperated the lay person from the benefits of the Dead Sea Scrolls for so many years.
1,Very good distortion. I bought this guy at my local music shop  less expensive there. I only have a few things to say.It has a great range. You can get a great lead tone from just about every setting on the pedal  thats why I bought it. I told the salesman I wanted something between classic rock and metal. This is what he recommended. It was a good choice.Pros Nice lead distortion Solid build True bypassCons Too expensive on Amazon my opinion Too much treble if youre not carefulI recommend it for live settings. Its a great pedal.
1,"Amazing series! I was hesistant about reading anything by Stephen King, as Im not a fan of horror, but the Dark Tower series is incredible. This books feels a little slow after the rapid pace of the first three, but as you read it, you are completely sucked in to Rolands young life. Dont let that scare you off! Im only into Book , but I can already tell how important the content of Wizard and Glass is to the series as a whole, and to the katets journey to the Dark Tower."
1,"Not Typical This is not your typical sounding jazz record, so dont be too surprised or turned off when you initially hear it. Ive discovered that the music on this one tends to grow on you over time. Of course, this version of Around Midnight is one the best ever, but there a lot of other gems here. The other bonus about this record is the clear, crisp sound quality. You feel like youre right next to his amp. If you like jazz guitar this is must have."
1,wonderfully exotic read This book was the first time Ive ever read a paranormal romance and I am addicted. Not only is the story fast moving and oh so romantic but wonderfully erotic too. I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a little escapism. If only a man like Gueirriro really did exsist!
1,"Loving, Logical, Simple, Training of Children This is the most straightforward, loving and effective book on child training that I have ever seen. Every parent should read this book! Following these simple, logical guidelines in parenting will produce happy, content children and productive members of society. I give this book to new parents so that they are able to develop good habits along the way instead of having to break bad habits later on in the childs life. Dont believe what the critics say. Read the book and judge for yourself. You will be blessed and so will your entire family."
1,"Great printer  extremely satisfied I have been extremely pleased with this printer  a printer is something that one uses all the time and just wants it to work. I have been pleased that I can scan, fax, email and just plain print double sided copies effortlessly. The best testament is that I dont think about it, its just there when I need it."
1,"Fantastic I was surprised at the readability of this work. I was expecting a large and tediously detailed work, but my goodness what a whopping good read. The reader benefits from the fact that both authors have had experience in journalism and training in research at the graduate level. This makes for a detailed and exciting blend of prose and detail. I highly recomment this work for anyone interested in th Century Imperialism and background on the current woes of South Asia."
1,"Crosswinds I was so happy to read more about Cat. I first observed her to be somewhat shallow. But as true with most people, the more you get to know them, the more you see their inner strength. A delightful little spit fire, she is."
1,"A CLASSIC Kevin Kline stars as the soontobe married small town teacher who is outed by one of his pupils during a television appearance. these are merley the seeds to an energetic comedy where Kevin Kline manicially runs around in the film trying to prove that hes not gay. There is a superb cast here which includes a fine supporting role from Tom Selleck who plays an openly gay reporter, as well as Joan cusack, matt Dillon and Whoopi Goldberg. They all sparkle against Paul Rudnicks razor sharp scripts that bubbles with fast, furious wit. Kevin Kline puts in a sensitive, carefully conceived performance rather than settling for a stereotypical role. Consistently funny throughout  a classic. Highly recommended."
1,"so far so good I live on a hill with heavy winds. I have had cheap flag brackets get bent in half, and other that simply cracked and broke. We have had a few storms this summer that put it to the test, and it has performed well."
1,"The Best CD Nickelbacks The Long Road is the best CD, hands down. The songs are awesome, they have meaning, and Chad Kroeger has a gorgeous voice. The first two singles are kick butt and the rest of the tracks are great. My three favorite unreleased tracks are , , and . You have to give this CD a try!"
1,"Multi Use!!! I originally bought the pens to let my kids personalize Christmas tree balls. They were okay for that, although medium point would have probably worked better. But now I find myself using this to label all sorts of things!!! In the past, Id have to use a label and tape on dark surfaces, but now I can write directly on things like power cords so I know what cord is for what. It is fantastic!!! Love them. Have bought them in all different colors, but the whitesilver works best for marking on dark surfaces. Also use them to label toys I take to parks."
1,"Nifty Didnt really buy these for kids. Bought them to paint and glue into a diorama. They are quite detailed and Im sure football minded kids would have a blast with them. Might want to keep them away from toddlers that might put them in their mouths, though likely too big to swallow."
1,"Alcoholics Anonymous aka The Big Book Ive read this book from cover to cover hundreds of times.I still find it hard to believe that a small group of people came together and wrote what would become the foundation of change for millions of people all over the world.If you need help no matter your compulsion, people places and things beyond alcohol and are ready to look into a possible solution then read this book.I swear that it will change your out look upon life just like it did mine.This is not an easy task. Nor is it AA, NA, etc a cult. The program simply requires that you have a believe that a power greater than yourself can could restore you to sanity. That power higher power, Allah, Jesus, God, group conscious, fly on the wall, nature, etc. NOT RELIGION.That being said even a agnostic borderline atheist like myself has found my way back to a life fuller and more amazing than I can ever have hoped."
1,"Well, that was new... If I were to come up with a single word to describe this book, it would have to be Disturbing. Marvel has strived to apparently make far more realistic characters out of the Avengers Icon, and have succeeded in ways I hadnt forseen. For those expecting the noble Captain America, Id worn you that hes about as hardnosed as youd expect a WWII vet to be. Thors motives are.... unexpected. And while character twists on Hulk, Ant Man, and Wasp do allow their characters to be far more human, they cross lines I wasnt expecting.Overall, I would definatly call this a good book. Just understand that its not the same Marvel Universe you grew up with."
1,"So far I really like this coffeemaker! I have had a Mr. Coffee for years. We dont drink a lot of coffee, so I figured why spend more . But recently, I havent been happy with the taste of the coffee that I was making, so I bought this. Love that there is no carafe! I know  other people who have this brand  different models and they both love it. So far I am very pleased."
1,"FANTASTIC! WOW..okay, first I have to admit I didnt buy this CD on Amazon, I bought it at the CD store I dont usually buy CDs online. The whole soundtrack was FANTASTIC. Of course, Josh Grobans Believe is the best on there, Im a HUGE fan of his and he put his all into that song, was very soft and beautiful, perfect for a Christmas album like this one. I never knew Tom Hanks could sing, first of all, he was great, he has SO much energy Steven Tyler is always the best at whatever he does, Rockin on Top of the World was great. The whole soundtrack was unreal Im so glad they included the old Christmas songs that we all grew up with, whether youre old or young. All in all, this is a MUST buy for the Christmas season!"
1,"THE MASTERPIECE BONE ALBUM! I must say that this is the bomb CD! Almost every song on here is worth listening to at least once. I will rate each song for you by beats and lyrics Scale . Da Introduction . E.  . Eternal . Crept and We Came . Down The Getaway . Mr. Bill Collector . Budsmokers Only . Crossroad . Me Killa . Land Of Tha Heartless . No Shorts, No Losses . st Of Tha Month .

1,"Phenominal Every so often a book hits the stands that has a profound impact on my life, changing the course definitively. All of my life I have been looking for the antonym for DOGMA. This books states it in the context of having a new thought about God. No where have I read a comprehensive statement that resonates with my own  years of life experience of a new perspective of Universal Life Energy Source, one of the infinite names of God. As the author entreats me, just consider that there may be something to know about God, the knowing of which changes everything!. Dogmatic religions belief systems have indeed become the problem rather than the solution. I have but to look at any newspaper today or watch any TV news broadcast and the insanity in the middle east confirms my perspective of reality about dogmatic organized religion. This book is a comprehensive statement of what must happen if the human race is to survive technologys ability to magnify our selfdestructiveness."
1,Outstanding Film!! This film should be watched not only by Catholics but also anyone who wants to see an outstanding movie with truly superb acting and excitement. The attention to detail and the true events which inspired this film have been brought together for an enjoyment that the whole family can see. I just wish I could give it ten stars but Amazon only goes to five. This film is Oscar material.
1,"Great for the price This is a great chess board for the price! Has great nonbreakable pieces which is important when you got little ones in the house that have very nice detail! The board is a bit flimsy but aint that bad. I would buy it again, its worth the money."
1,"Oustanding Overview I think that too many people invest without thinking why, they do it without a strategy or a framework. This book helps you undertsand the small cap market and guides you in your quest for superior long term returns. If you are looking for the stock of the day stay in the chatrooms."
1,"best bsides collection ever done man, who could have thought they are just bsides. with the songs noel already can make those famous junk bands, matchbox ....... everclear...., look like a joke. along with suedes scifi lullabies, the best bsides albums i have ever listened."
1,TVs best show I have watched this from season one and Wwat and Jessie have never let me down. The situations they get into are fun and the way they seem to get out of them makes it an on the edge of your seat suspensefull ride.
1,"Terrible in Low Light I purchased this camera about  years ago and due to its inability to take a picture in low light I only used it outdoors, and it did a great job. I recently bought a new computer and guess what? Canon has not come up with any software to download any of my pictures on the new VISTA operating system. I hope they are taking care of this with their new camera models. Looks like Ill be buying a new camera but it wont be a Canon. Color me unhappy."
1,"lightweight Protagonist Jessica Darling is a bona fide Mean Girl, only without the yen to shop. The author gives her every sympathy button possible distant dad, mom who prefers glamorous older sis, best friend moving away, etc., but somehow fails to make Jessica particularly likeable or sympathetic. Rather than the sensitive, profound outsider I think shes supposed to be, she comes across as a potty mouthed little girl who whines endlessly, avoids taking any real responsibility for her woes, has one thing on her mind only the two guys she has crushes on and compulsively refers to her female classmates as skanks, bitches, hos, and worse. I know chick lit is supposed to be fluff, but cant we do better than this? Ive read the reviews, and if this many girls want to be Jessica Darling, the future looks bleak."
1,"So simple but so great Ive started trying to eat healthier so egg whites was a nobrainer. Sadly, getting actual egg whites from eggs was more than annoying until I got this. It works GREAT. Just clip it to your bowl and crack the egg and viola. notes. The bowl clip is slightly finicky in that it wont attach to EVERY bowl. It works best on thin bowls that dont have a lip, meaning if its a thin straight up side for it to attach on it will have best results like that.. Its best if you crack the egg right over the device. Dont try to be goofy and crack it a foot or  above.I can easily recommend this for anyone who wants a cheap, easy way to get your egg whites."
1,"Spine Tingling Thriller! Joan plays Myra Hudson, a successful playrite who marries Jack Palance then discovers an awful truth....Now watch Joanie go to work in a very clever way to out fox the villians......It is no surprise to me that Miss Crawford was nominated for an Oscar for this edge of your seat Hitchcockian like thriller...It is a job very well done and Miss Crawford deserves a vivacious round of applause!! ATTA GIRL JOANIE!!!"
1,"needed...hard to find. These cables are not everything , everywhere cables so that usually makes them pricey and hard to find. item is as presented and arrived in great condition. Excellent purchase."
1,Love IT!!! This is the perfect workout for me. It gives me the cardio I need without the extra jumping around that puts strain on your ankles and legs. I love everything about it and I will use it often. Highly recommend.
1,"love it! I have enjoyed this video for many years with my nephew and nieces. As soon as my daughter was old enought to enjoy it, I purchased it. She loves to watch other kids and she loves to sing and dance. All of that along with a very good way to remember age appropriate scripture makes this video a must have for my family!"
1,"A great reference! I love this book! It is full of of useful exercises, and they are arranged in a logical progressionby topic. Sadly, I dont get to use it as often as I would like, because I lend it out so often!"
1,"The Aussie Mega Shampoo was very good. I ... The Aussie Mega Shampoo was very good. I was a little leery using it at first since I have colored hair. But it left my hair very soft and manageable. The smell was very good, too. Im very pleased with this shampoo and now Im going to buy it when Im finished with what I received. And Ive already recommended it to family."
1,"Trina the baddest bit I really like Trina,she knows how to represent for the ladies. This album is definetly hot,though not quite as good as her follow up Diamond Princess. I would recommend this album because it has a lot of good tracks,though I would probably recommend the version with the track Pull Over,because that is a really tight song. Buy this albumyou wont regret it!!!"
1,these are not that bad! these tweeters are the best  dollar tweeters I have ever used ill tell you that. but it does tend to have a little scratchiness to it at high volume. But for  im not complaining.
1,"Hilarious! I cant believe they are still selling this book! It has been two years since the election and Edwards is no longer even in politics yet they still sell the book. They totally lost the election, yet when reading the book it sounds like they think they are going to win. If you are a republican which I am not I would suggest hurling this book at democrats to make them feel bad. I am an independent so I always feel bad laugh out loud funny!"
1,Pentax DSmobile  Scanner Nice little unit  interface is easy to understand but it appears to limit the scanners performance and slows the whole operation down. The images are fuzzier than I expected but for the price this is a solid performer.
1,"Backstreets Back I just bought the new backstreet boys c.d. and its awesome, I recommend this c.d. to everyone. If you dont have it youre missing out on a great c.d. My favorite song is crawling back to you"
1,"A must for all families I have had this book for sometime but until recently when I began having problems with my th grader, I began reading it. This book gives you a daily motivation not only to the reader but helps you to give the same motivation and inspiration to your children. The pocket size book is nice. It can be used over and over. It has  meditations, affirmations and inspirations that correlate with each day of the year. In this world of today, a little inspiration can go a long way to get you through the day! Hope you enjoy it."
1,"All the songs are good, but it doesnt flow as an album I have been a huge Mariah fan for about  years now and I have to admit that, although I can see what she was trying to do in bringing out this album, it doesnt mesh well because her music has become so varied the older songs, including Hero and Emotions etc dont seem right with such hip hop tracks as Sweetheart and the Fantasy remixwhich, by the way, is EXCELLENT! Individually, each song is fabulous, but the album as a whole seems badly mixed. As for Mariahs taste in fashion, it is completely irrelevant to her talent, which is still alive and well!!!"
1,"Very cute! I was slightly disappointing because I was expecting it to be one episode for EACH of the furious five not all crammed into one! . I feel like they could have taken the story a little more in depth, especially if they have made it into several episodes. I especially thought monkeys story was lacking and neglected, especially in comparison to Viper and Tigress stories... and the animation was not as up to par as the movie but thats not really that big of a deal.On the other hand it was adorable! It was great to know the backgrounds of the furious five and I especially loved Tigress story and it actually can help make some connections in King Fu Panda ! Very cute, great for kids and kung fu panda fans a like!!"
1,"The color is GREAT I like this printer, but do not like the software. The software is a pig. I have not had any problems with this machine. The scanner does a great job, as well are the printing, and copies. I have owned this machine for about a year now, with no problems."
1,A great product for a great price I was looking at giving  bucks for and in store brand HDMI  foot cable. So out of curiosity I Google HDMI cable and came up with a link to Amazon for a prize that was so low that I said this cant be right and on top of that free shipping. I thought this has to be a typo so I added two to the basket only really needing one expecting to get an email telling me that there had been a mistake and they couldnt honor my purchase.But instead everything went threw no problem what so ever.the product and price is unbelievable. Ive told countless numbers of people about it.I put the cable in use the moment I revived it and I couldnt believe the difference it made in my picture and sound.I saved about  dollars.
1,"Thought provoking, and Inspirational I must recommend this documentry to everyone. Although I had read a book of Chomskys Secrets, Lies and Democracy I never fully understood his views. That is, until I saw this film. I then began asking myself certain questions. Why had I never learned about dissenters i.e. Chomsky, Zinn in public high school or read about them in a paper? Or for that matter why was mainstream politics and the media that covered it so exclusionary? That is, why does the media never fully investigate dissenting voices. This film is a wonderful introduction to the tireless work of Chomsky. Humorous, brilliant, and caring, he is a truly an inspirational figure. In short, go out and get this film, you will not regret it."
1,"Geeks this is for you! LBC is the best band I ever heard. I heard this CD at a friends house and ever since I,ve been a full time fan. Think of your favorite Cd it probally has a couple of really cool songs right? Well now think of a cd where every song is as amazing as the last. If i had to describe LBC in three words they would be KICK A BAND!"
1,"Physical GeologyEarth revealed I is an excellent textbook however, I was under the understanding that I would be getting the th edition , not the th edition. I kept it anyway, since  of the information is still current. It also came with  excellent CD ROMs."
1,"Great bottle! After deciding to replace our Nalgene bottles, I researched metal bottles from various manufacturers. Sigg bottles consistently scored high in reliablility and satisfaction, so we bought a few of them. My only nit is that the lids are easy to drop and maybe lose, so an included lanyard would be nice. But aside from that minor complaint, the bottles are light, odortasteless, and dead sexy, to quote someone famous!"
1,"Great Shorts I had no issues with sizing, Ordered a x in Black of these shorts and it says it ranges from , I wear a size  and these fit Just right, inch or less of extra waist room. They are nice and lightweight and I really like the material. Keeps me cool in a hot kitchen environment, but can also throw some long socks on and tough it through the cold and windy days.I will definately purchase more of these"
1,"Great! This is the only cable I have used in the past  years. Studio, live, and at home, it performs well in all aspects. The biggest plus on top of that is lifetime warranty. This means that whenever the cable gets faulty which isnt often at all you can get it replaced free of charge. This has kept me from having to buy cables for  years. Yes, it is pricey upfront, but you will never ever have to buy another cable.I also use a  Monster Cable to run from my DI to my amp when needed. I plan on buying all Monster cable ifwhen I ever start using pedals."
1,"We need more like this! This was one of the most underrated movies of the s underrated because not many movie fans know how to appreciate an intelligent movie. While most movies grow more boring each time you watch them, this one gets better everytime."
1,"A tad bit too eclectic, even for a DP fan. The sheer volume of work found on these three discs is real testimony to the bands depth and focus on their music. I gave it four stars due in part to the repetitive nature of some of the more obscure pieces. In fairness, this set comes from a period of time midlate s when they were developing their style and making their niche in the rock world. Consequently, there is a lot of exploratory work, so if you want to get deeply into the bands roots, this might be a worthwhile buy. Ritchie Blackmores unique vocals and the guitar work are reason enough to fork over the change."
1,"One of the BEST!!! This is one of the best Skynyrd cds out there. If you like Metallica then that explains you ignorance! Then again Im sure you cant be older than . FYI...a true music lover loves ALL music, youre just a little boy who likes music."
1,"Good Insight I am not a teen anymore, but a decade ago, I was. I never went to a public school, or delt with teenage dating, drugs, suicide, sneaking around, or all of that drama. I purchased this for a special teen in my life who has had to go to public school and face all of that. I read it before I gave it to her, and I think I learned some things that enter into the average teens life. I hope she enjoys it, and learns, laughs and grows as I did."
1,"Great Alternative to SoyWhey I found this powder while researching alternatives to soy  whey protein. I believe it is byfar a healthier alternative. The ingredients are very straight forward natural and recognizable, not chemical, which I appreciate. While Im in love with the product and its benefits, I do find I have to mask the taste by blending with fruits and juices. It has a strong taste and texture that takes some getting used to."
1,Max Factor Line Maker Eyeliner I emailed Max Factor and discovered that the Max Factor Line Maker had been discontinued. I was extremely happy to find that it was still available online through Amazon. I had a friend who uses it and I wanted to get it for her as a Christmas gift. I received it when it was promised and was able to send it to my friend as a Christmas gift.
1,"Spiral Poi by Pyro Pixies First off, let me say that Magic Geek Juggling Store is one of the best companies Ive dealt with online in ages. They went out of their way to make sure I got the product I wanted, and I received personal followups from two different employees. Fantastic!Now, the poi. Spiral Poi by Pyro Pixies is a very wellmade product solid and sturdy. Unfortunately they do not weigh as much as I had hoped they would. Their lighter weight makes them more difficult to spin because they have very little momentum. Ill probably add some weights to mine. The scarves are superlong and ultrabright, which makes for a beautiful effect. I definitely recommend this product, especially if you can get it from Magic Geek.Spiral Poi"
1,Love It! I bought these headphones for my daughter and she just loves them for her ipod mini. The ones that came with her ipod blew out after only  month. She is very happy with these headphones especially because they are the in ear type.
1,"Passed today using only this book! I passed this exam today with a . I used only this book to prepare and spent about  hours reading it. I didnt bother with the practice tests. I used REA for all the other exams but this book is just so nice and short and it covers all the material, while the REA book for this exam is quite longwinded. This book is perfect!"
1,"My Sisters Favourite My sister was asking me a good perfume as a present for quite a long time and then came her marriage. I was in India and after a thorough sweep over the best perfume shops in Hyderabad I found this one and it costed me  bucks in Indian rupee. There were lot lined in the shop, huge brands with great offers. But its for my sister on her best day, so I thought the gift also should be the best and to her taste. I presented her this hoping I know her taste. She didnt use it for a while. I felt bad and I thought I dont know her taste. But one fine day she called to tell me how much she liked the perfume. How, many people came and complimented her about her perfume when she went for an occasion. Thanks Eclat.Now I am in US. I want to give the same happiness to my other two sisters and they already started liking it, event though they actually didnt start using it."
1,"Great Book Michael Harner is really knows his stuff. It is an easy to read and understand book. I would recommend reading for anyone who is looking to start their journey into shamanism or for someone who has already began. He taught me a lot through this book. It covers all the basics, great read. Cannot speak highly enough of the book."
1,"Poodle Hat will please Weird Al is back! After a year recording break, Weird Al establishes once again that he is the king of musical parodies. Longtime fans will have different opinions of how Poodle Hat compares to his previous recordings, but most will probably agree that no one gets a laugh out of music like Monsieur Yankovic. The most creative songs on the album Bob and Hardware Store. Bob is hilarious once you grasp the humor of the song. I wish I believed that Al could actually sing that last verse of Hardware Store without taking a breath! If he somehow actually did, he should be enshrined in the Lung Power Hall of Fame. The biggest yawner surprisingly, the polka medley, which is usually one of my favorites. The best parody The Complicated Song. All in all, a good, but not great, addition to your Weird Al collection."
1,"Wild bird hunting is a fair and grand sport As a kid I loved to hunt all sorts of wild fowl. From quail, geese, ducks and doves, I was truly an avid hunter. In addition to loving the sport, I enjoyed eating most everything I shot. I will say that shooting a darting dove was nearly as challenging as pulling down a mallard duck in full flight. As long as birds are flying, and not sitting or walking on the ground, I see nothing wrong with hunting. Hunting grew out of necessity, and as long as it is properly regulated, I see it as a great sport. No different than fishing As for myself, Idont care to kill anything now days, but certainly support the right for all those who continue to enjoy wild bird hunting."
1,"Third times the Charm The Third Edition of the legendary role playing system is by far the best yet! As a old time gamer, since , Ive played DD as my mainstay game. Every edition has continued to evolve and add new dimensions to the game. This third edition really brings the game to life. The charachter generation, the selection of skills and feats that charachters have to choose from , and the games ability to capture relatively complicated modifiers in a very simple and easytouse system makes this the new Kingofthehill in my gaming diet. This rd Edition PHB is a gourgeous volume. The illustrations are terriffic, the charts are clear and intelligible, and the charachter generater CDRom in the back cover makes learning the new rules a breeze. Do yourself a favor and get this for your gaming library, it really packs a punch,Oh, did I mention how cool the new monk class is?"
1,"Never Disappointed Well the Queen has done it again! I was NOT disappointed with this th installment of the Vampire Huntress Legend series. L.A. Banks has continued to add depth, intrigue and most assuredly DRAMA to her characters and storyline. I feel like I know each and every character intimately. This time around, the reader is lead on a more emotional, soul searching journey than in The Forbidden the th book, and while I was wringing my hands w emotional frustration I was loving every bit of it. As always Banks has masterfully incorporated history, culture, diversity, politics, world events, religion, and the supernatural into a FANTASTIC story. This is definitely a MUST read and a valuable addition to any library.P.S. The illustrated poster by Eric Battle which is enclosed in the back of the book in the first printing is HOT, OFF DA HOOK, COOL, ETC.!"
1,"Good sounding Live In Denmark  show. This is a  CD set  of Deep Purple live at KB Hallen .Deep Purple  Live In Denmark .It is the same show as the black  white video that was performed for a live TV audience at KB Hallen. If you havent seen the footage, find a copy. This is a rippin show from the Mark lineup.The show was recorded before the famous Made In Japan shows.While Made In Japan has the ultimate vibe and seems ready to fly apart , this show is different.Denmark is a probably, technically superior performance and still rocks out in Deep Purple fashion.There are various older discs of this KB Hallen show in circulation , and like California Jam, there are some concerns with the previous issues.The newer releases are the ones to have."

Be assured that this chamois will not scratch or harm your LCD, Plasma, LED, or whatever TV you own.I Can take confidence and be rough on my screen cleaning now since its a soft material that will keep surface from scratch!!!Microfiber is the way to go whenever cleaning you expensive electronics.Thumbs Up, love the cloth! XD"
1,"More of the best from Pfanz! Like his other outstanding books Pfanz continues the superior details backed by biographies and personal accounts. Pfanz briefly explains the st Day battle and how it basically shaped Union and Confederate positions around Cemetary and Culps Hill. After bringing the reader into position Pfanz brings you to the frontlines as General Ewell and General Howard collide. Ewell and the Confederates seize the town and sharpshooters abound on roof tops while artillery battles take place between Cemetary Hill and Benners Hill. Pfanz then captures General Johnsons attack and the Confederate repulse as the Confederates struggle to take Culps and Cemetary Hill and the final attacks fail and continue to cause extreme bloodshed. Maps are also included to assist the reader with positions and movements which completes this fine book. As with all of Pfanzs work, be prepared for a huge amount of detail followed by descriptive action!"
1,"Fantastic Clippers Safari Professional Large Nail Trimmer For DogsI have been using these clippers for a couple months now on three small dogs. After reading the reviews from others I can also say that yes after TONS of other horrible nail clippers  THE SAFARI ONES ARE GREAT.They are easy to use. My dogs still dont like me to touch their feet, but since these clippers do exactly what they say they will do  it makes it a lot easier and saves me dog for nail clipping."
1,What a deal! Included all  blueRay movies as advertised. This is such a great deal.I didnt have any of these and wanted to see the Batman ones before I saw the rd movie.Ordered via the free  day shipping and got it in  days including the th of July weekend so not slow at all.
1,"Fair and Tender Ladies I would give Fair and Tender Ladies by Lee Smith  stars!! Oh my word! I love this book!! It is beautifully written. I absolutely love Ivy! She is a strong, funny, fascinating character. This book is a new favorite for me!"
1,Great account of this famous battle When the movie on Gettysburg was first released in Australia I tried desperately to find a book to read about the battle. I found this one and I enjoyed it a great deal. It may not be the most detailed account available but I found it to be one of the best that gave a complete overview of the  days fighting without getting lost or bored. The authors style of writing was refreshing and enjoyable and I found it hard to put the book down. Still one of my favourite books on this battle although I have read many since.
1,"Excellent Pair of Shoes! cute too I wanted something different in a pair of shoes, so I ordered these fun orange colored shoes. THEY are awesome! One of the best pairs of shoes I have ever owned. They fit nice, it is weird the first time you put them on because there is no tongue or laces on the shoe. Take a little to get used to. BUT they are really comfortable. Great buy!"
1,"Rock N Roll Baby! This is the best Xbox game I own to date and if you love RPGs then this is definately a must own. The graphics are FANTASTIC. You run in water and watch the realistic waves move and bounce. The lighting is great and the overall play is awesome.The spell graphics are wonderful and bright and look really sweet on my  TV. I was a huge fan of the PC versions and this one hasnt disappointed yet.The only issue I have is that this is supposed to be in Dolby Surround and the instructions indicate there is a Stereo feature under options when in reality there isnt any stereo option. I have Dolby . and cant get any sound to come out of my back speakers.Other than that, this game is a blast."
1,"Coffe lovers I bought this coffee press at the behest of a Starbucks barista where I frequent. I explained that I was upset that the coffee at home did or taste as good as the coffee from them. It is extremely easy to use and to clean up as opposed to a coffee maker. It brings out the full flavor of the coffee. I also ordered a manual coffee grinder with it which may add to the taste since it doesnt have to go through heated grinds of an electric grinder. I would absolutely recommend this to coffee lovers out there. My only regret is that I bought a small one and find myself pressing twice to completely fill my thermos. Nevertheless, an excellent buy."
1,"Quite happy with ours I am surprised to see so many negative reviews. Weve had ours for five or six years, use it at least daily, and have been quite satisified with its performance. It generally toasts the bread evenly, and is consistent from batch to batch and from one day to the next. It doesnt seem that slow to me, but my expectations may differ from yours. I agree the  slice switch is confusing, but we just leave it on the fourslice setting. I also agree it is a bit pricey, but most of our previous toasters only lasted a couple of years and did not perform as consistently. Perhaps Cuisinart has a quality control problem, but we wouldnt hesitate to buy another one. Good luck."
1,"Whats not to love? Considering I have every season and preorder them.... I think that speaks for itself. Who doesnt love Charlie Hunnam? The show is a little hard core, so not everyone will like it, but Ive convinced a number of friends and coworkers to watch it, and they thank me each season becuase they have another addiction that they have to feed."
1,"Love My Pink Rolator I purchased the Pink Breast Care Awareness Rolator based on the product. I have done searches and this one meets my needs. Its very light and I can put it in the car with ease. Also I support the Breast Care Awareness all the way and having this on my rolator shows my support. Not to mention, being a pink rolator, I love Pink so this worked out in all areas. I received it with no problem. Shipping was inexpensive. I love it!!"

1,"The best book ever on sailing or building faster boats I thought I knew about meteorology, waves, boatbuilding and sailing. I have a first class Cambridge degree in physics, have sailed and raced various boats dinghies and sailboards for  years and designed one fast dinghy. I thought I was one smart dude. Words begin to fail me. Wow! I wish I had known this lot  years ago. It turns out that I was pig ignorant. The book is the best I have ever seen on what the wind does. Its the best ever on how to handle it. Its extremely good on rigs and how to adjust them. Its not just the best ever, its streets ahead. Dont expect to read it quickly. There is a vast amount to take in. If you really know your stuff you might get through it in a few weeks. Better to plan on a whole winter."
1,Great toy I bought this doll care package for  year old daughter almost  and she loves it. There are tons of accessories included so it keeps her occupied for awhile. Her twin brother also loves to play with it.
1,"Works great! I purchased the DLO  TransDock micro for use with my new Zen VisionM. I followed the instructions and it works great. I was able to locate an unused radio frequency in the Washington, DC, area and it works very nicely all over the city. The power adapter is a very tight fit  much tighter than my cell phone charger  in the power outlet. I did hear some static at one point, but it seems that the cable connecting the Zen with the TransDock functions like an antenna and, once the MP player was repositioned, the static went away. Ive had it one month and so far feel it was a great purchase."
1,Mulan is a great cd that should be bought by everyone Mulan is a great cd and has all of the songs from the movie. It is enjoyable by all people of all ages. It was a great movie as well with a great story of being true to your heart. BUY IT! Songs with an asian background and easy lyrics that are fun to sing along with.
1,"Fantastic scissors! These things are very comfy for long term use, cut extremely straight, are sharper then your average scissors and dont get stuck to tape. The only complaint is that the packaging is cheap and they naturally opened up in the mail. Otherwise I would look at other Westcott items for future purchase based on the high quality of these scissors in relation to their sale price."
1,rockin great time This is a great album for parties or just ridin in your car! i should know ive been listening to this band ever since i was born! This is becuase the lead singer cliff johnson is my uncle! well anyway if you liked this album be sure to check out the new album fallin in!
1,"The Lynch Doesnt Fall Far from the Tree A quirky procedural on the surface about a pair of FBI agents investigating murders in the American southwest, Surveillance turns expectations on its head with one unheard whisper from a child victim. You might quibble with the timing of when director Jennifer Lynchs truth is revealedI didnt see it coming until shortly before the momentbut you cant argue with the performances, especially Bill Pullman and Julia Ormond. Not for the squeemish, and the contradictory recollections of the victims and perpetrators as the story unfolds is a nice touch. A much better effort than her last feature, Boxing Helena, Surveillance actually tries to lead you down a twisted path that you can follow. Kudos to her for also following her story to the unsettling end rather than looking for the easy way out for audiences."
1,"Put this in your library. Excellent! Far and away, the best of her series. This book does nothing short of an excellent job of explaining HTML at a source level. Like Castros other books, each version has gotten better than the former. The first version was great for its time. This is no exception. This uses realworld examples from the start through the finish to explain how HTML and style sheets work. This book is useful for HTML programmers as well as CGI programmers needing an HTML reference. This one is in my personal and office libraries. I will need to buy another copy soon because everyone keeps asking me for mine."
1,"Pronoia now and then Every time I pick up this book and start to read, my mood changes. These wise words pull me right out of any of the shadows that the world can send my way. I begin to feel lighter and less worried about the state of the world. I feel hope and maybe even start to hum a ditty. Even if the universe is not constantly sending blessings our way, it can be enough to consider the posibility. I have worked for the last twenty years with the criminally mentally ill. This book is a good anidote to that toxic environment. The expanded edition makes this tome worth another read. The author came upon many of his ideas through the experience of the event called Burning Man. If you cant make it there do the next best thing and read the book."
1,Motivational music My  year old niece recently began playing the mandolin. I thought the cd may have provided some good inspiration for her and it really has. She is quite eager now to play many of the songs on the cd and is trying new arrangements on her own daily. A good motivational gift for young players.
1,very good read! anything by this author is a great read! Like stories about bad boys with motorcycles and other fun? I think this read is very well written. Brenda has moved on to write bigger books but her older works are just as refreshing as her current works.
1,"Works! So far so good. Does what its supposed to, and seems to have a similar battery life as the original canon. Havent used it extensively, but for the amount i have used it, it works very well, especially for the price!"
1,"This is a book that will make you not want to put it down. The ABC Murders by Agatha Christie is a very good book. The story is outstanding and keeps you interested, and is set in  in England. Hercule Poirot, the great detective, receives anonymous letters from someone called ABC. These letters state a city and a date inside them, and Poirot suspects a crime. I liked this book mainly because it keeps you wondering what is going to happen next. The only dislike I have is that sometimes it was hard to follow, but later things clear up. Therefore, if you like mystery novels that make you not want to stop reading, you should definitely read this book."
1,"Never give up, never surrender THIS MOVIE IS SEXY, BOMB and just all around good. One of the twilight Saga is in here. And he is smoking. This movie is Raw so brace yourself.But it is a good movie, and at the same time you learn lessons. an angry mind is a narrow mind. At first when I bought this movie I thought it wouldnt be good as it was. i thought it would be all about violence and trouble but it wasnt. It was wonderful! It was sweet. It was sexy as hell. I mean the guys in the movies and their bodies will have you drooling and will make you want to see this movie again and again. Im not one for spoilers. But this movie is awesome. Just keep in mind there are two scene in this movie that are very raw, and unexpected, this movie is definitely not for little kids and lets just leave it at that. I think you should be over  if you were to see this movie. Its too bad it didnt get to go in theatres. . The final ending will have you cheering and yelling."
1,"Hanson rocks! If you saw hanson live on the TTA tour, this is your video. It recaps the exprince of seeing hanson live, with a live concert! They preform all thier awsome songs, and you get a front row seat! Didnt get a chance to see them? Heres your chance! Either way its a MUST HAVE for ANY fan!"
1,"Fantastic biography....a mustread. Maas did an exquisite job of presenting Gravanos story without all the hokey, Hollywoody glamour that is often given to mob stories. It is laid out on the table, as was....no fluff, just the facts. While the book was long, it was far easier to understand the information than it was to read it in the papers and hear it on television during Gottis trial. The book exudes Gravanos bravery in stepping forward to finally do what is right."
1,Great Trainer This is the only trainer that I have owned so I have to qualify this review. I researched trainers online fairly extensively before making my purchase. My research led me to this being the most appropriate trainer for me. One thing that impressed me about it was that it lived up to all the hype I read about it. I dont often find products that this can be said of. Initially I thought that was not as quiet as they claimed but found that there is some break in period for the bike tire and resistance wheel. In no time however I found it to be as quiet as it was said to be. I thoroughly enjoy the ride. No trainer will ever be the same as riding the road but when conditions dont permit this is a great substitute.
1,"Masterful Ive never been a huge Joni Mitchell. I like her, have seen her live a couple of times, and own a few of her albums. Ive always greatly respected her as a songwriter, but lost interest in her right about the time The Hissing of Summer Lawns came out.She won me back with Turbulent Indigo. Absolutely masterful. It has been decribed by some as music to slit your wrists by. I dont see it that way. The outpouring of emotion on this album is incredible. Some of the best lyrics she ever wrote, and definitely the best group of musicians she ever had. A Grammy winner for Album of the Year in . Deservedly so."
1,"Love this guy! While I think the gospel singers drown out Clays beautiful voice on Bridge Over Troubled Water it is still a good song. However, This is the Night gives me goosebumps. This young man has a beautiful voice. Because I was a avid viewer of American Idol, I can picture him singing this song. Clay is truly the American Idol and when his CD is released later this summer, it will rocket to  in sales. This is the Night has a great beat and the more I hear it the more I love it. Im already signing it without the CD playing!! I LOVE THIS GUY!"
1,"I thought I was ordering d version..But I ordered this movie with several others that I thought were d blueray!Boy, was I wrong!! However, My Mitsubishi WD d tv  with sony d blue ray player made this movie EXCELLENT by using the d depth mode under the d settings in the menu guide! The depth is FANTASTIC..its almost as good as d!!"
1,"A Feast for Crows The whole collection is readable and entertaining, although I found some books better than others. The author is a bit of a sadist, killing many of the most likeable characters, and the baddies are really bad. I do not hesitate in recommendig this novel."
1,"SIMPLY THE BEST! Amlia in italian is something really seducing!Her nature is perfect to give soul and voice to these traditional italian songs. Because Amlia was sad and joyful, like the Lisbon of Fernando Pessoa... Tarantella and Ciuri ciuri, for instance, are magnificent and you can also listen to the italian versions of the famous Barco Negro, Coimbra and Vou dar de beber  dor.Amlia is always the best, whatever she sings."
1,The cartridge works fine right out of the box. Im not sure why so many people are having trouble with this ink cartridge? I got mine yesterday and it worked fine. I would recommend this cartridge to anyone.
1,"Twitches THis is one of the better in this series. It focuses on BOTH cam and Alex, two opposites who realize their siters and witches. They must team up and save people. They meet some intreasting charcters such as Karsh, a wise dumbledore figure, Ilena, a fiery blonde and Thantos their evil uncle whos out to get them."
1,"Cast Iron Cooking for dummies Have all was been interested in cooking with Cast Iron cooking but unable to get a lot off information. So when I seen this book advertised I decided to buy it. I have found this book very informative. There is a lot of information on Cast Iron cookware i.e. quality, curing cast iron, recipes, etc.. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in cast iron cooking and since reading this book, cast iron cooking is the only way to go for most of my cooking. So follow the excellent instuctions and you cannot go wrong."
1,"perfect Not only one of the most exquisitely wrought movies Im aware of, its one of the most perfectly laid out stories Ive ever come across.More to the point, the film teaches an important moral lesson never trust the French postal service."
1,"what a find! I found this lying around in the break room where i work.  hours later id finished it. What a detailed and deliteful tale! Aside from some minor stumbling plot points the text read itself. the information was densely packed yet immediatly readable. Its been a long time since ive enjoyed a scifi book this much. So i came online to find other books. only to find that they are out of print...if you can find copies of this book, read them..then hunger for the others as i do."
1,"So adorable w a lesson in the book I got this book for my sons rd bday. He has the how do dinosaurs clean their room book and it was always one of his faves. So I thought this would be a good one since lately he has been not liking bed time. Pefect.. now when I read it and I say does a dinosaur throw himself on top of his covers and cry? and he says noooooo with a smile. So he gets it, no fits at bed time. So far it has helped. Also he likes to pretend to read this to himself."
1,Pure beauty of persian classical music This is one of the best recording of Parisa. This is a live recording of her concert in Japan . I highly recommend this CD to all who enjoy Persian classical music.
1,"MMC IS HOT! I love this cd. Out of all the cds in the world, i like this one the most. JC from NSYNC is in this. He is my favorite performer. I used to watch the show every day. Im so mad it went off the air. Anyone who has seen the MMC should but it."
1,Amazing  Cant Believe this guy used to be in Kiss! This is incredible work! He sounds nothing like he does in Kiss. Its amazing early work that I really enjoyed hearing. Much more diverse than his new CD! Awesome!
1,"Spanish Wine Bota My Husband and i took a trip to the U.P. went kyaking on the Grand Island,MI.....the bota bag did quite well then we went a bit farther by shuttling up to Grand Marais, MI and hiked the  mile trip down to Musining Falls, MI and the bota bage held two bottles of wine and we enjoyed our evening dinners after our long days of hiking with a wonderful glass of wine from our no leakage at all bota bag......THANKS"
1,Its Very Useful My baby has used this since she was  months old It has a sturdy wide base..It has height adjusters...you can recline it..very secure safty belts but I do make sure my babies hands are nowhere near it when I buckle it thats the only thing I dislike about this highchair. I dont find it hard to clean ..it comes with two trays and it has wheels and folds up definately worth the money especially now because its on sale ..I paid full price
1,"Short Bio of Country Legends Country Music Changed My Life is one of several text books we are using for our History of Country Music class at Appalachian State. You read short bios of numerous legends of country music and their humble beginnings. Several artists who started in rock and roll but always had a yearning and love for country music, you observe their struggles with contracts and record companies as they change to the music they love. Conway Twitty is a major example. Ken shares personal stories of his life growing up, the tragedies he faced, and how country music surrounded and saturated his life. This book is well written, and easy to read."
1,"Great find, hubby! My husband found this wonderful toy for my month old for Christmas. It goes everywhere he goes. He absolutely loves it and can spend hours on it. Even though now hes had it for four  months, he still enjoys it. He especially loves the numbers and alphabet. Hes dropped it numerous times, but it still keeps ticking. I highly recommend this product."
1,"Astounding Excellent. Beautiful, entertaining and educational. Comprehensive. From tide pools to the bottom of the ocean, from the Arctic and Antarctic to tropical reefs, from tiny algae and plankton to crabs, turtles, sharks, whales, sea birds and everything in between. Many things I had never seen before. The best documentary I have ever watched, even with a steady diet of OPB and the Nature channel. Family also loved it. PG in a few places."
1,"Ive Discovered Yoga and I love it ! I am a very inflexible woman of  years of age. I have degenerative disk disease w stenosis in my back with the added problem of arthritis through my whole body. I have been encouraged to move more. I can not walk because of my back problems. I will not join a gym to do Yoga because, as we plus sized women know, we dont quite fit in and I am embarrassed to go. So, I thought that it would be fun to see if they had any plus sized DVDs that I could do in the privacy of my own home. I can not praise this DVD and Abby enough ! I have been doing the warm up and now the Session  for a week now and I can already notice a change in my body. My abdominals are strengthened and I have more energy. Please order this if you are at any level of Plus Size. Abby makes it easy to accommodate any size and she makes me feel so good about myself. I have NEVER done Yoga in my life before."
1,"Well Made and Lots of Fun! I love these because they arent plastic, and they are larger than the classic plastic alphabet magnets. The color is well coated on the wood, they are thick enough that my young toddler she got these at  months and is now  months can pull them off and place them back on metal. The colors are bright, the shapes are rounded so no hard edges. The box has one AZ in upper case, and one in lower case. My daughter has been playing with them for four months  she sticks them on the dishwasher, the bottom of the fridge, plays with them with her blocks, etc. No issues with chipping, fading, disentigrating, peeling, etc. She has put them in her mouth, but hasnt bit or chewed them so I cant say what would happen if one did that. I think they are great quality, really cute, and have considered buying another pack once she is spelling so we can make more words!"
1,"Great Watch, Great Dealer! I had looked at this watch in regular retail stores. I thought I would check out Amazons pricing and availability.Fantastic Results! It was half the price and recieved the watch in two days! standard shippingIt came in a beautiful Seiko box with the factory warranty and instruction book!The watch itself is a great looking timepiece and has been very accurate in time keeping."
1,"Better Lucky than Smart I ordered Tabers Cyclopedic guide first, but it arrived with some pages damaged in binding. And it seemed compressed in size and with its explanations. So I sent it back thank you damage and switched to Mosbys. Hooray! Bigger  better  more thorough with LOTS of pictures. The words searched for are printed in blue, with the definitions in black, making it easy to scan for your subject. Lucky me."
1,"The Living Dessert I remember seeing this series when I was a child and it impressed me then and it should be a great tool for teaching in grammer schools today.It is true to life today as long as we have Desserts, but of course only Disney can tell a wonderful story."
1,"know what you get These are as great deal and excellent quality FOR WHAT IT IS. I got some SOLID Pinkies for my dog  labradoodle and wanted spares as she loves them so much!!Unfortunately, these are made in two pieces and glued together not solid. They bounce great but are not made for her kind of torture. I gave them to a teacher and kids will love them. Now gotta find some solid ones..."
1,"Portable Wallace For those who use this classic grammar for reference, having Wallace available on CD is a welcome alternative to lugging around the  plus page hard cover text. Although I travel frequently, with this CD, I can still teach Greek over the internet and do exegetical studies for sermon preperation. Add the CD version of BDAGs lexicon, NA Greek NT CD, pack the laptop and leave the library at home."
1,"These two should have their own television show! This is a funny, funny, funny book! I cant wait to see these two on Conans show and with Ellen Degenerous. Melinda and Kathleen are stars. No surprise that they irritate some folks After all, theyre brilliant, beautiful, sexy, witty, accomplished and, oh yeah, Catholic. This copy goes to my book club the next to my boyfriend."
1,"La Autopista de Cortzar This is a book in spanish, so Ill write down the review in spanish.Cortzar es un escritor hbil que, como ya han notado muchos crticos, intenta describir la experiencia esttica del artista a travs de un lenguaje deliberadamente complejo que, quiz, logra captar ese mtiz particular que el artista descubre en la realidad.Las babas de diablo es un tpico ejemplo de lo dicho precedentemente, sin embargo, tambin es visible en Cortzar el gusto por lo fantstico, como en Casa tomada, donde el misterio nunca es revelado, pero si sus funestas consecuencias. En resumn, no creo que Cortzar sea un escritor fcil, pero es un escritor interesante, y ste libro, con todos sus defectos, contiene cuentos extraordinariamente bien escritos,y, se puede aadir intencionalmente bien escritos."
1,"Not what you would expect! Steve Martins writing is simply intoxicating. He pulls you into the story with characters that you could believe and understand. This story focuses on almost a late coming of age story of a young woman named Mirabelle who searches for acceptance and love, yet within that process finds herself. It is beautifully written and not what you expect from comedian Martin."
1,"Great computer camera, little less on stand alone This camera takes great photos when hooked up to your PC. The video output is great and the self adjustment for low lighting allows you to sit in a room lit with table lamps and still appear brightly lit with good detail. It works very well with modem hookups for conferencing or instant messaging with video. However, when hooked in with DSL this camera flys. The microphone picks up sound very well."
1,"Solid outing This is a solid outing from one of the premier groups of s Christian rock, including their big hits Crack the Sky, Love God, Hate Sin, and For My Growing. A top effort, but not quite up to s Big World.Track List Side  . Crack the Sky . Love God, Hate Sin . Closer than a Heartbeat . Give It Up . I Belong Side  . Let Me Be the One . Reach for the Sky . Heart on Fire . For My GrowingDoxology Prayer"
1,"Great portable gps device Its the st time that I actually became an owner of this device  must say I am very much impressed. It worked right out of the box  it is very user friendly. No more printing directions from my pc before heading out on a trip. One can convert currency, check the world clock  so forth... Definitely a must have in todays world"
1,Toddler Essential This seat lets kids be relaxed using a big potty while traveling or on errands. It makes all public bathrooms the same  even a portapotty. It mostly keeps kids from touching the public seat. There are no problems with it folding if you put it at the front of the seat. The only reason I didnt give it  stars is that it is hard for a kid to climb up themselves without knocking it off. I lost the one I had  probably left it in a bathroom while washing hands  and I like it enough that Im ordering another.
1,"changed some from original turbans... I have used these turbans for many years, but have had a real problem finding them in the last couple of years. My older turbans have no elastic and are a bit smaller than these, which I prefer because I have a small head and short hair. I realize that I am probably in the minority, so I am still giving it  stars! The material is great, the button is fantastic  once on, it stays on and you can do whatever you want it will not come off or loosen. They last for many years and are well worth the higher cost than the other turban out there."
1,"Facing Death with a smirk Reaper man is probably the definitive work about DEATH, and pretty hilarious to boot. Terry Pratchet does make you laugh about the concept of Death, join Death in Its journey trough unemployment and down to earth living xcuse the pun, after reading Terrys antropomorphisation phew, long word, he. of Death youll never have anything but sweet and funny dreams about It nightmares are really something reserved for other authors Imaginary Universes. If reality was made of imagination, Terry Pratchet would be the sole owner."
1,"Now Kano Now This is one of the better greatest hits compilations that I have heard in sometime. Basically, all the songs featured are solid and more importantly far ahead of their time. Remember, Kano was an early to mid s dance music performers. I have New York Cake on vinyl, the tracks Cant hold back, Shes a star, Baby not tonight and Dont try to stop me are strong. However, the recording is short. I wanted to here more, the greatest hits compilation provided that. This musical act put in a great deal of time and concentrated effort, you can expect a tribute web site from me to them for all they have accomplished. A musical act s might want to release a tribute recording as the vast majority of these tarcks could blend in rather well with todays music. Regardless of timeframe, there ia always a place for disco dance music. Kano is a good, solid musical act, I would really enjoy hearing Stardust remake Kanos music, respectfully, Doug."
1,"Satisfactory This Peter Pan video is satisfactory. The packaging is in good condition and the disc plays fine except for one spot, where it freezes for a moment, then moves on. Its not long, and it moves forward after several seconds, so it isnt worth sending back. My yrold granddaughter doesnt seem to notice."
1,"Truly a Precious Gem! This book should be in every Christian home out there!This book has helped me tremendously on my walk with Jesus. I highly recommend it for anyone who wants to know their Saviour more personally. The revelations in this book are absolutely profound! It shows you how everything in the Mosaic Tabernacle wasis a shadow and type, a picture of our LORD Jesus Christ!If I lost mine I would get it back no matter the price. This is one of those books you read again and again."
1,"The Most Fantastic Book on the Face of this World! The Golden Compass is a the best book I ever read! If you like fantasy, adventure, mystery, and great characters, this book is for you! Lyra, a young girl is plunged into mystery and intrigue by a visit from her uncle Asriel ans the appearance of the Gobblers. Filled with great characters, new ideas, and a wonderful storyline, The Golden Compass is a book to read and enjoy many, many, many times over"
1,"Fantasic book to start a discussion I have  kids, so I wasnt sure that this book would be good for all of them. Each day is only a page long, with a verse and then a reflect and pray sentence or two. The story that is told to reaffirm the verse is very basic, but gets the point across. I find this book to be a fantastic discussion starter. While the book itself doesnt get very deep it certainly opens a door to discuss all kinds of things with my kids. And tells it in a way that I might not thought of explaining it to the kids to begin with.I highly recommend this book whether you only have  minutes to spend on it on certain days, or have plenty of time to discuss. I love this book and the extra time I get to spend together."
1,"Childrens book Sandra Boynton has many clever and entertaining childrens books available. This is certainly one of them. However, I add the following caveat you would probably not enjoy reading it to your child if you are a traditional male or a person that would prefer not to express affection openly. I certainly hope that there are some other males out there that are comfortable with more openly loving on their child. I just wanted to make sure that you know what youre purchasing. The book is composed as a love song to your child from the perspective of a mother dog to its puppy mother to child. If you dont enjoy expressing overt affectionate feelings toward your child, you probably wont enjoy reading this book to your child. If you do, however, its a good opportunity to lay a couple of good kisses on the little puppy that you love."
1,"What a dump, and I still enjoyed it! This is a truly unique movie. The leads cant act, the sets look rediculous, the plot is so thin, you hardly know it is there, but it is still wonderfully entertaining. Flash Gordon makes one big joke out of every other sciencefiction movie ever made. The supporting cast, led by Max von Sydow and Timophy Dalton gives their best possible performance, even if Dalton has trouble at times to keep a straight face. The sets are so crummy, that they only add to the entertainment, von Sydow has a great time being evil. An excellent movie for the whole family. The children will take it seriously and love it there is even enough sex to make them think their almost grownup and adults will have a good laugh. Either way, nobody is going to be bored."
1,"excellant cooking implement This is the spatula used and recommended by Americas Test Kitchen. I gave this as a gift to my niece, who is just learning to cook. She has raved about it. When it arrived, I thought it was a bit large, but my niece has found it very useful for many tasks."
1,"PK grill will outlast me PK charcoal grillWe purchased our grill as a young married couple in the fifties and I still use it frequently. I actually have a pork shoulder on the grill as we speak, for football company. The plastic wheels are gone but everyone raves over the flavor and tenderness of the meat. I am now in my seventies and the body of the grill is as good as ever."

1,"Swiftly Flowing Narrative Equals a Good Summer Read Thomas Farel Heffernan has all the elements of a swift and exciting summer read in Mutiny on the Globe The Fatal Voyage of Samuel Comstock. The author pares the story down to its essentials, the bloody mutiny and its aftermath. Some historical context is lost in the rush for that readers should consult the excellent In the Heart of the Sea by Nathaniel Philbrick, a wonderfully detailed book covering the same historical period. What may be lacking in context is replaced by breathtaking, and often bloody, action. This is the perfect summery beach history book that provides thrills without sacrificing intelligence."
1,"help i think i feel better This book is filled with all of the info i was looking for. It supported my theory that I was recieveing the wrong medical advise and then it began to reveal to me what my problem might actually be. It is written with class and humor all combined in a manner to educate the lay person about a much unresearched medical condition. The book left me feeling like I was a normal and functional human and that I was not alone in my problem, and that there are indeed awnsers to this medical condition that I have."
1,"Charming with Really Quite Detailed Instructions The Dynamic Doll Duo of Mr. and Mrs. Suwa have done a magnificent job with this book. The level of detail in this little book is absolutely incredible. Step by step instructions with step by step visuals photographs and very preciselyrendered little technical drawings.Additionally, there are some color plates of finished Shimotsuke the Japanese paper doll tradition hailing from Tochigi Prefecture.And the text has suprisingly loving or instructive little nuggets of prose The short bob is a little girls hair style. Make this head with the same tender feeling that you have toward your own child."
1,"I Couldnt Put This Book Down! I picked up this book at my library on a lark. Ive always been interested in what really happened to Amelia Earhart, but always just assumed that her plane crashed into the ocean. This book, however, completely opened my eyes to a new hypothosis that Amelia and her navigator managed to land on an island and send out radio signals for help. The information presented in this book isnt just wild guesses and conspiracy theories  the authors make a point of backing up their thoughts with cold, hard evidence. I was hooked from the first page and got so engrossed that I ended up not doing my work at my job just so that I could finish a few more chapters. The book also has a wicked sense of humor and debunks the myth that scientists are just stodgy old guys. Id reccomend this book to anyone with even an ounce of curosity. Im holding my breath until Dr. Tom King and the other authors put out another book on Amelia. I cant wait to see what they find!"
1,"New CelticJazz This is a great album, having a newage sound but with a definite Celtic mood. This is the multiinstrument artist who is well known for his recordings with the AfroCelt Sound Band and other groups. He plays mostly high and low whistles in this album. Some tracks are slow and haunting, others lively and rythmic, and yet others are his takes on some old favorites. If you like the soothing sounds of a wind instrument in the hands of a master, this is a definite must."
1,"Christmas Gift for a Friend She absolutely loves it, especially considering Al is her favorite character. About half the size of your average pillow, but still very comfy. Takes it with her in the car as a car buddy and to the campus library or wherever she needs a nap. Definitely not as hard as Als armor duh, but definitely as soft as Al himself is."
1,"Unbelieveable I was talked into getting this by a salesperson. I was sure I would regret buying it as soon as I committed to doing so.The first time I used it i thought it was wonderful. Since then it has NEVER let me down.I was happy with my  volt dewalt drill. I used it A LOT. However since purchasing this tool  months ago I suspect I can count on both hands the number of times I have used the drill. I ALWAYS reach for this tool first.Compared to the drill it is lighter, more powerful, faster, and just plain all around better."
1,"Pros and Cons My husband and I have been using these for a couple of years now and we love them. Weve gone through several pairs. They have excellent sound quality and they stay in my ears through my many miles of jogging. My only complaint is that one side inevitably shorts out after about  months of use. This is been an issue with headphonesearbuds for as long as Ive been listening to them. I remember the same thing happening listening to my portable CD player or walkman as a teenager so its nothing new. I have yet to find a set of headphones whose wires DONT short out after several months of use. That being said, theyre easy to replace at  a pop, so I consider it a fairly minor complaint."
1,"pretty impressive After some guest collabs and just releasing singles, Defari comes on point when he breaks out his solo project, focused dailey. The album starts out nicely with the title song. I know everybody is talking about Bionics and Killing Spree as the best, but man, I think Focused Dailey was the winner. The beat is one of the best Ive ever heard, I think it was produced by Alchemist, and the lyrics shows why he can boast that hes Focused Dailey. Dont get me wrong, Bionics and Killing Spree are as dangerous as their titles. Get this, pretty impressive for a debut album."
1,Deep thoughts from within Microsoft Inside Out is filled with fun and thoughtful comments by thousands of current and past Microsoft employees. It offers great insight into how various folks at Microsoft approach not just work but how they have fun as well.A good read for those both Inside and Outside of Microsoft.
1,"An Original, Fun  Romantic Romp into Fantasy I bought this book years ago while walking through the book section in a local KMart. The cover caught my eye. At the time, I read mainly fantasies, but I had also read a few regencies. The combination of the two genres, plus the creative use of letter writing to tell the story intrigued me. Am I glad I purchased that book.To this day, I have never seen it in a book store. I must have loaned it to more than  friends over the yearsall of whom have loved this book. I just had to write a review when I saw it with a slightly different title offered at Amazon.Buy this book!"
1,"Easy cooking, easy cleanup, good eating Cooking with the foreman Grilleration is just as easy as before  even better. The overhead design allows for larger pieces to fit inside. You wont need to slice your meatfishvegetable in half, as long as theyre defrosted. Cleanup is a breeze. You can take out the plates, hand wash them, or throw them in the dishwasher.The food is just as good as before, its just as easy to cook, and cleaning up is  times easier! I love it!"
1,"Good Product My law office in on the second floor of a building built over  years ago, long before modern fire codes. I wanted this fire escape ladder as there is only  exit and I was concerned that in case of fire that  exit might be blocked. This ladder addresses my concerns and is reasonably priced and has decent quality. However, like other reviewers, I am disappointed it is designed for  time use only, as this prevents us from actually testing it. Since I bought this ladder with knowledge from other reviews that it was  time use only, I cannot really complain. However, I did deduct  star.  stars from me."
1,"Finally, a Harry Potter movie thats actually good! A big fan of the books, I was severely dissapointed in the first movie. The second movie...better, but still not as good as the book its based on. Now the third one is here, and the new directer did an excellent job.Its funny, the actors are brilliant, Buckbeak is awesome, lets just put it that way, its deep, its creepy...its got everything!!!My one single complaint is that they didnt explain some things, but its nothing that they probably arent planning to insert in another movie.God bless this new directer. He finally made a Harry Potter movie that was worth the watch."
1,"Organizer Great Quality. Great Price. Convenient and cheap alternative to a bulky and expensive dresser, for people who have limited space in their bedrooms. It holds a good amount of clothes and is pretty sturdy. The canvas material quality is much stronger than that of some other polyester, plastic feeling materials."
1,"A Great End to a Great Series Beautys Release is the last of the wonderful series. The trilogy covers all elements of submission in erotic love, from the most brutal punishments to the most subtle domination......I would advise everyone to get the entire series and read the books in order. Wonderful pornographic writing. A real treat for fans of erotica. Beautys Release is perhaps my least favorite of the trilogy, but saying my least favorite of this trilogy is a bit like saying my least favorite chocolate bar.....still really great. The sultans palace takes the eroticisim to new heights, and the conclusion to the story is a truly lovely one"
1,excellent!! Great packagingquick servicetop quality DVD very reasonably pricedwhat more could I ask for? I would definitely conduct business wiith this seller and Amazon again. Thank u soooo much! Oh  the movie itself was excellent. Kept me in stitches!!!!!
1,"Had to return st one. Purchased the Forerunner  as a gift for my wife who runs quite a bit. I charged the device as soon as we got it. It would not power on even after charging all night. It said Charging Complete. I called Garmin support which tried to do a couple different resets, but nothing worked. So I returned it to Amazon. They sent a new one out which has worked perfectly. The first one must have been a lemon.Both of us have used the watch for several runs now. I think it is great. It finds satellites quickly and hasnt dropped the signal on me yet. I found it easy to use and I believe my wife does as well. I have no regrets about purchasing this watch. Im also glad Amazon has a wonderful return policy to handle these types of failures."
1,"The King Of Observational Humor At His Best! I got the collection in pristine condition today. I havent stopped laughing since I put the collection on my CD changer. Its an amazing collection from Georges early Dirty Hippie era. If you love George, like I do, then get this collection. It will not disappoint you, I promise!"
1,"Excellent!! I believe this is one of Shaun Jeffreys earlier works and, since I read the three of them chronologically anyway out of order as I understand it, from newest to oldest, the beginning did SEEM to reflect that fact. But, I could be wrong. The novel, overall, after the first chapter for sure, was very satisfying and, in my humble opinion, begging for a sequel. I can happily say it was well worth the purchase!!Sincerely,J.G. Franklin"
1,"A New Christmas Tale... Whiteout is another exciting tale by Ken Follett  author of the amazing Pillars of the Earth. Here we have a germheist gone badly. The criminals are trying to steal a new strain of germs  presumably to terrorists  from one of the most secure research facilities on earth. Toni Gallo is the head of security of the instillation and also happens to be in love with her boss. So her job, her love and her life are now all in jeopardy now that the security has been breached.Follett intertwines the story in a very clever way that has all interested parties meeting up at the same estate to get shelter from the blizzard. Children, extended family, employees, inlaws, and psychopaths are all forced to spend Christmas together  with vials of a killer germ on the kitchen table... The tension grows almost as fast as the snow piling up outside, and keeps building until something snaps.This isnt Folletts best work, but is an enjoyable tale, and worth reading on a snowy weekend.Relic"
1,"A MUST READ BOOK I thought that Eragon was a very intriguing book. There was a lot of fantasy, adventure and mystery. The book was amazing for someone only fifteen years old to write.Eragon, a young farm boy, finds a blue stone in a forest called the Spine. The stone turns out to be a dragon egg. After the dragon hatches from the egg, Eragon secretly raises it. Eragon names the dragon Saphira. One day, the dragon goes crazy and takes Eragon deep into the Spine. When Eragon and the dragon return to their home, they find that it has been burnt down. Eragons Uncle Garrow is found dead in the rumble. Eragon and Saphira set out in search of the people responsible for this tragedy.The plot makes you want to keep reading until the end of the book. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in science fiction and fantasy!"
1,"Didnt put it down  even after I finished the book What a rewarding book! This story of an offbeat friendship between a Brooklyn kid and his baseball hero feels real, had me laughing convulsively, kept me waiting breathlessly for the next adventure, and brought to life a great cast of supporting characters.What makes the book so special is that, although often hilarious, there is a gentle side to the humor. At the same, while it is a very moving story, there is nothing schlocky about it.Two suggestions First, dont skip a single word. And second, forget about getting any work done till you get to the last page."
1,"Excellent and educational My husband read the book and we have been watching the movie as a family. Our  year old is actually excited about watching it and even bought the soundtrack. The film is approachable for children, though the language occasionally requires interpretation and there are some gory scenes, i.e. people with the pox and surgery. I think it does a good job of bringing history alive for kids and adults. It has motivated us to try other historical movies to encourage an interest in history."
1,"The best auto racing movie ever. I first saw this movie in original release on the BIG screen. Since the invention of the DVD I have been waiting for Grand Prix.The wait is finally over, and it was worth it.Beautiful cinematography, a great score, and the cars, oh the cars."
1,"Got it now... I havent used this yet but I did finally receive it after a  month delay.The tote area for putting food is actually quite small. I think this would be a good tote to bring a couple of small sandwiches, not subs, on regular bread and maybe a few pieces of fruit or some pastry bread with cheese and fruit.It can fit those really small tupperware dishes but if you were to bring say pasta salad in a smmd container, you will either take up too much room or it just wont fit.This tote is truly for a small bread, cheese and fruit type picnic. Not for bringing fried chicken, potatopasta salad and some cobbler. The rest of the tote is as described. Very nice looking and sturdy. I would buy again as a gift but I am still on the hunt for the same type of tote, just more storage!"
1,"Novena Miracles Throughout my life I had always wondered about the power of Novenas yet I had never found a book that could show me how to partake in these devotions. Then I found the Novena book and I discovered a world full of inspirational prayers that bring wonderful results. The novenas found in this book are easy to understand and pray with a variety of lengths for those who have an hour to pray or for those who only have a fifteen minute break in their schedule. Each novena is placed in one of the following sections angles, saints, Mary, and GodJesus. These highly organized categories allow the reader to find the novena that they want to prayer with ease and they can also find novenas based on what their prayers are dedicated to. I defiantly recommend this title because it is well written and I myself have felt the power of the miracles that these novenas create."

1,"Fine Collection of Breakthrough ECM Dates Mr Burton, during the period these recordings were made, was often brilliant in his musical experimentations with several notable musical pioneers, and assisted so well, by producer Manfred Eicher. An extraordinarily fertile period for these great talents, wellrepresented here includes the memorable year , when ECM released no less than four fine collaborations in Burtons name Matchbook, a duet with Ralph Towner Ring, with Eberhard Weber and Steve Swallow on basses, Mick Goodrick, and a young Pat Metheny on guitars, and Bob Moses on drums Seven Songs for Quartet Chamber Orchestra from which the beautiful Michael Gibbs piece Three is included here, and Hotel Hello, a duet with Swallow. I was fortunate enough to see a festival of these ECM artists in  in Hampton, VA as they toured the U.S. for the first time. These albums made a great impression on me at the time, and each one of the Works in the series was excellently put together!"
1,"Lots of Gothic Here This bulky collection of stories, like most which span a writers life, have patches of unevenness throughout and my edition goes to  pages. The consistent theme of Weltys prose is that the south is definitely a world apart. There are the odd nicknames, the long shadow of racism, and the sense of defeat and enclosure of the postCivil War South. It is an odd testament of a people and a culture a part of America but also separated from it this sense of being at one with the nation but also severed from it makes for interesting, although sometimes tiring, reading."
1,"Brita slim pitcher The well water in my new house had a little bitter taste.The coffee didnt taste that great.My girlfriend always buys bottled water.I bought the Brita slim pitcher based on customer reviews , and Im glad I did.The bitterness was gone, the coffee taste great and we no longer buy bottled water."
1,"Election Thriller Deception Point started with horrific excitement. The author, Dan Brown, kept you guessing what was going to happen next. There was no shortage of surprises, twist and turns surrounding the senator running for the presidency. His daughter is constantly challenged with hair raising events that will keep you trying to protect her.The staff of the president exploits their positions in unusual ways to help gain another four years in office.Is the president a participant in the events? You have to read the book to find your answers, enjoy!"
1,"A very well researched, fascinating topic There are always times when I hear phrases like do animals have feelings? And I feel like saying, yes they do, and even more so. By observing animals around me, I get to understand and appreciate the place of my existence in the vast universe. Sheldrake does a fine job of documenting cases where dogs and cats show their sixth sense abilities with humans. The idea of experimenting with animals is a touchy subject, but there was nothing cruel about the way the experiments were carried out. Sheldrake proves that by learning from our animal friends we may indeed discovered that we have tapped into an invaluable resource."
1,"Two very nice late nite makeout albums on  CD! These  very lush Julie London LPs are combined on one CD. Londin sticks mostly to jazz standards, and sounds very appealing on both sessions. Highly recommended."
1,"great this is a great book for children. there are lots of fun activitys as, well as alot of info. your children and you will find many interesting things to do. if you have children you will want to buy this book."
1,GREAT GREED THIS IS A PRODUCT I HAVE USED FOR MANY YEARS. cURRENTLY A DISCONTINUED ITEM FROM REVLON. BUT THE SCALPERS ARE OUT THERE ! I HOPE THEY LOSE ALL THEIR HAIR FOR THE GREED THEY SHOW. THIS WAS A . ITEM  IS NOW BEING OFFERED AT ....THAT IS WORSE THAN A BERNIE MADOFF...GD BLESS YOU... KEEP YOUR PRODUCT... I HOPE IT GETS MOLDY  RANCID IN YOUR OFFICE.
1,"Espionage is not for the faint of heart!!! It was entertaining...Good versus evil...Right versus wrong...And the price for betrayal....The British genre of spy movies is first class,and Sean Bean is as good as it gets...Show us a sequel..."
1,love these! I thought they were gonna be hard plastic and cheap but they werent at all...they are made out of soft rubber almost and they look so real my kids play with these all the time and even fight over them. I highly recommend
1,"Truth remains more interesting than fiction Why would anyone want to read a novel when they can spend time with this truelife thriller? The author has unearthed the real story of a despicable but fascinating character. The book is thoroughly researched and informative, as well as nicely written. This is a pageturner for anyone interested in true crime andor the American Civil War."
1,A Monty Python Classic The Meaning of Life makes fun of society undertones. Although it does drags in the middle there are delightful and humorous scenes such as the contrast ideas of reproduction between Catholics and Protestants. And if you have a week constitution please fast forward pass the vomiting sketch.
1,"Guide to Owning a Burmese Cat Feeding, Grooming, Health, Handling, Exhibition This book is a great starters guide to owning and basic understanding of the history of Burmese cats. Useful basic information on care, feeding and breeding."
1,"Nothing like a good murder for Christmas Since another reviewer has already given everyone a good idea of the plot, I am not going to repeat it here. Id say Christmas is definitely a good time to read this story. And if youre already an Adrien English mysteries fan, this revised rd instalment is unmissable.Id say its best one yet, even though I am heartbroken over some part of the story development, so be warned.This newly revised steamiererotically enhanced edition is more than just more sex. The newly added bits offer quite some pivotal points regarding Adrien  Jakes difficult relationship. And also shaded more lights on Jakes inner struggle.The mystery itself, needless to say, is tightly plotted and highly engrossing to read. To me, Lanyons main attaction is always his charaters, the main and the supporting cast, all so well written, you just cant get enough of them.And of course, I am begging for th one to arrive soon. Dont miss it."
1,"SO much better than the Brita faucet filter I was stuck with the Brita tap filter because that was all they had at Home Depot. After a little research on Amazon, I purchased this and it is much better. It does what it is supposed to do and nothing more."
1,"Logitech Wireless DJ Music System This unit was exceptionally easy to setup right out of the box. I have not had the problem with music dropouts except on rare occasions. Bear in mind, the mp format does not showcase the sonic realism of the original format ie. wav files. All in all, I am very pleased with this unit and would buy it again and would recommend it."
1,"Great activity book Each page in the book has a different theme like picnic, space, sports, etc and relevant colorformlike stickers. My  year old loves putting the reusable stickers on the pages again and again. The only problem with the book is that the stickers are initially difficult, even for an adult, to remove from the original sheet."
1,Seabiscuit An American Legen I could not put this book down. It made me laugh and it made me cry. This is an example of excellent storytelling infusing American History with a story of the ultimate underdog. Dont miss this one!
1,"Essential steelband music The highlights on this album are the first  last tracks, being quintessentially Trinidadian steelpan playing, very muchin the mode of Ellie Manette  music I grew up with. Which is not intended to diminish the tracks in between  which are also a joy to listen to. Accomplished playing and brilliant recording  unlike my old Trinidad RCA Victor vinyls of the s.If you have any interest in pan music this is a musthave."
1,"Excellent resource!!! This is a great resource with thematic activities including quality book lists, art, drama, song, science, math, and language. I used it extensively when I taught preschool in a developmentally appropriate quality program. Highly recommended."
1,Good behind the scenes action This is a captivating video. I got this for my wife and we both loved it. We had no idea what the verdict would be and was surprised by all the drama. Excellent direction and camerasound work. I really like the interviews with the lawyers and the accused and the family. This is a rare look into a persons life during a murder trial. Surprises around every corner. This is not a court tv type of show. It is an amazing documentary and should be watchedstudied in school. They made a movie with the same title but to me it isnt worth watching. Save your money and watch this one. What I like about Amazon is that you can find movies like this. Trying to find this in a video store would be impossible. Strangely after I bought it I saw it on the Sundance Channel. So if you want to save even more money look for it on your cable tv.
1,"Entertaining read with a few logic flaws Very entertaining read with a couple logic flaws and even more typos. Neal needs a new editor. Anyway, if you enjoyed his previous efforts you will not be disappointed here. There is some of the strongest character development Asher has ever done in this book. While I dont think this reaches the level of The Skinner, his best work to date IMHO, it was an enjoyable quick read with a satisfying ending."
1,"Good math book, even for beginners The book explains vectors and matrix math very well.It helps you create a good matrix classes and vector classes.But other than that it does not show how to apply the knowledge to create a D engine. It mostly just covers the math, which it does very well. If the scope was only math and not code then I would have given it  stars but it says on the front page of the bookPut mathematical theory into practice with working C classes.....And it does give you an idea of how to do things. It just does not help you tie it all together. But few books cover everything, so its still a very good buy."
1,A great life story about how not to live. This book is a wonderful story of the harsh and sometimes sad life that Jake La Motta lead. It is surprising that such a strong fighter could me such a weak man. Read it and watch the great movie.
1,"This is copper clad aluminum speaker wire This is copper clad aluminum speaker wire. I should have known based on the price for  feet of  gauge. I think Amazon should mention in the description that it is copper clad aluminum and not  copper. Its not bad at  cents a foot. Its easy to work with, its accurately described as  gauge and  feet. I am using it with a  channel home theater. I intend to replace the wires for FL, FR, and C channels with  gauge pure copper as I am using a high current power amp  wattschannel to drive these speakers. The RCA copper clad can drive my surrounds for now."
1,"Great item, great price These headphones were really a great gift to my wife. Since she travels alot for business I thought this was a fine gift and sure enough she loves them. Very comfotable around the ears, sound great in an ipod and best of all at the touch of a button you have noise canceled out around you. I will get a pair for myself next. Another great feature I liked is that they fold up nicely into a nice pouch that comes with the headphones."
1,"Scary stuff for  If you have never seen an Ed Wood movie, then check this one out! Its cheesy, its cheap, and the inept story begs for forgiveness. But for some crazy reason I keep viewing it. Even with Belas unrelenting ramblings about who knows what?, I still believe there is a definate message of understanding for the viewer. Only Ed himself could tell you why that stock footage of a buffalo herd were edited into the film, unless you could have the answere. Personally, I think he was trying to show that the extinction of a species was close at hand. In  that was a certaincy for the bison, and the bigotry associated with it towards humans. Times have certainly changed. Some of it to the worse. But the message in that socalled awfull flick, is alive today as it has been, well over forty years ago."
1,"Love this cart! Cart was easy to put together, is very sturdy, and works like a dream! I can fill up the cart in my laundry room, then just wheel it to wherever I want to fold laundry. Love this cart! Definitely would recommend!"
1,"A great star you never heard of This woman can do it in her sleep. Shes got an incredible voice, terrific phrasing, and really puts her stamp on each song. Dont be fooled by the fact youve never heard her. She put this album out on her own and its got more love in it than a record company could dream of. TRY IT AND IF YOU DONT LIKE IT WRITE ME AN ANGRY EMAIL. I BET YOU LOVE IT."
1,"Good product for the money Needed ampreceiver for deck and house speakers to replace really good proton that lost led lights and finally ability for balance button to work. Didnt want to spend much, so took chance on Sherwood for  bucks.I run separate box to control different speakers, so plain amp works.Hoping this lasts, the receiver weighs less than half of the proton. Easy controls, decent sound. No treble, bass, or midrange controls however. I was leery, but sound out of the box is good as is. I havent tried tuner since dont typically use.Works well for the money. If youre looking for decent cheap receiver, this fits the bill."
1,Expectation Definetly a lot of suspense. Keeps the reader focused throgh out the reading. Worth to stay a saturday night reading it.Not exactly the kind of fiction you would read before sleep. Pure intrigue with some feelings involved in the most subtle way. The details given filled my imagination to make it almost believable.
1,"Works as advertised This printer works as advertised. Completely happy with it.Its just great to have a printer connected to the network like this. We ALWAYS have one computer or the other going down constantly and so this helps tremendously. In fact, now Ive even got my internet connection and a central hard disk hooked up directly to my wireless router for the exact same reason.I ran it for months without security and just finished setting it up with WEP. Was easy if you know where to go...Which brings me to  Thanks a TON to all you helpful people who guide us around the tricks and traps. Ive started to read the reviews on Amazon now before I buy ANYTHING!"
1,Memory Lane... I couldnt believe my luck when I received this as a gift from my wife last year...I sat down and watched all  episodes! All of my children can recite the entire theme song and have come to know the quirkiness of their father a tad more because of this amazing series! Whats next? The Banana Splits???
1,Its the best bonnet film out there Great performance of all the actors involved. My wife and I love watching it together. Brilliant story  thats key with any movie. This film is the best kept secret out there.
1,"Excellent Guide to Hinduism !! This book is simple and descriptive. I am a Hindu and I live in the United States. Several Americans have questioned me about my religion and sometimes I used to have a hard time explaining my answers. This book helped me to explain myself in a comprehensive way.The book provides everday examples of rituals, traditions and ceremonies which are a daytoday routine in an Hindu household.In addition, the book describes the basic principles of Hinduism and the origin of these principles.An added bonus is the role of society and the way relationships play an important role in a Hindu family.An excellent read for Hindus and nonHindus."
1,"not just yet I know money has to be made. Parents and uber fans will buy these, but as for me, I love the series and can wait until an awesome, complete set comes out later. If they never get to make the next movies, if a drastic cast change happens or if the production company drops it all  I will have regrets not buying this set. For what it is now, I still give it high reviews but Ill keep my few remaining greenbacks for gasoline and food."
1,Worth the Money This item is well worth the money. I purchased it for my son on Christmas. The delivery was so fast I could not believe it. I think they used superman to deliver. The boat is well constructed. I am not sure about putting  people in it.  people can fish comfortably anything more would mean sardines. Inflating the boat is easy with numbered chambers. I would certainly recomend using a  V inflator. It takes about  min to inflate with a  volt pump. A foot pump seems to be inadecuate for the size. It does have alot of little extras like the trolling rod holders. I did make my own motor mount which works great. I put a lb thrust trolling motor and it works great in the lakes. This boat can be registered and used in public waters. It is very portable can be stored in a closet. What more can you ask for under .
1,A great book! Very rarely do you come across a book that you cannot put down this is one of those books. T. Greenwood goes beyond the t.v. movie approach to the subject of Munchausens by Proxy and artfully explores the story of the lasting effects it had on Indie and her family. This book is wonderfully written and crafted in such away that I was actually disapointed when I got to the last page simply because it was over.
1,"AHHH.... Beauty! The movie, House of Flying Daggers, is a pure gem. I think it is possibly the most underated movie this year and should be seen by everyone. The love story is operatic in its beauty and tragedy, and I was holding tears back through the entire film due to its simple yet dramatic grace and the gentle melodies of the score. However, when the credits appeared and that beautiful voice of Katleen Battle rang through my ears, I could no longer hold in the tears and began to cry profusely.The movie is true MUST SEE and the Soundtrack should be listened to over and over."
1,One of the best Curb seasons Loved this season  and really have enjoyed rewatching it on DVD. I defy anyone to watch the Crazy Eyes Killah episode and not die laughing. Definitely a classic season Curb at its best  which is to say its funniest.
1,"Merry Christmas to you by Reba I wanted this CD for the poem, Your Christmas Guest. But every song on the CD is more than worthy of Rebas magic with lyrics. This is a must for your Christmas albums."
1,"Easytouse replacement net The original plastic bases of the net for our ping pong table had cracked from the wear and weather. This replacement from Kettler was identical to the original, fit perfectly and was easy to set up. The price was reasonable."
1,"Surprise Never having used the Waterpik before, I havent another to compare, but it seems to be doing an excellent job. I will know more after I have been examined by my dentist who recommended it."
1,"Care more about a womans heart than her Tatas Exposes the lies behind birth control, breast cancer, and heart disease which kills almost ten times the women as breast cancer. Learn how to live naturally and look up all the source documents on Pub Med such as HAMLET the component of human breast milk that kills cancer cells!"
1,"tons of tones This is an incredible tour de force and an awesome metal cd. If you want your neighbors to be REALLY frieghtened, forget cannibal corpse or anything else. I do believe this is what you hear when you die. The musicianship is amazing, lyrics are firstrate. Wide vocal ranges. If the usual metal aint cuttin it this will reinstill all faith in truly brutal metal. If you purchase this with ASMEGIN and ARSIS your next few weeks will be a euphoric blurr of ecstacy. This s should be illegal."
1,"She does it again.. Laurell K. Hamilton whips up another book..and once again,I love it. The main character in this book is so unique,and so interesting,that it makes this book twice as good. A Kiss of Shadows is well written,and it looks like she has done quite some research to write this book. This book caught my attention rather quickly,and once again I love all the characters. It was oddly sad to me when I read it,but it is nonetheless a great book. I highly recommend it."
1,Quick jaw clamp I find this brand of clamp to be easy to operate one handed and comfortable to the hand. It is stronger and will exert more pressure than other clamps I have used. I have owned these clamps in  different lengths for four years and they are a superior product.
1,"Best Deodorant Around The best deodorant around. I use white vinegar first to eliminate bacteria cheap, safe and very effective. Then this product pleasant with no overpowering perfume scent and also very safe. I order  at a time. Try just one. Smells sort of just like Vita Bath but far less expensive. This is my rd year of using the product. Highly Recommended."
1,"A timeless story I first read this book as a child and never forgot the story. Never before or since have I been so pulled into a story. I felt as if I was Sally. The ending never fails to tickle me, no matter how often I read it. I make it a point to read it to my class every year. They are as entralled by the book as I always am."
1,"Absolutely fabulous An awsome book. I cannot recommend it highly enough. I went to court and won, solely based on the information provided in this book. My traffic citation claimed that I was going  over the limit. I submitted a request for discovery to the prosecuting agency, modifying one of the forms included in this book. In court, I made a motion for dismissal of the charges against me, using the instructions provided in this book. The prosecutor acknowledged that he did not honor my request for discovery. The judge dismissed the case. If you received a traffic ticket, it is worth fighting it, using the information in this book."
1,"One of the top  books I have ever read!! The passion is a fascinating and captivating book. It is worth reading alone in order to appreciate Wintersons mastery of the English language and her ability spin picture perfect descriptions through the use of original metaphors. Her insight into human relationships and her ability to create two completely different yet credible characters provide the reader with an additional treat. The Passion is realistic enough so that anyone can relate to its plot, yet true dreamers will be enchanted by its elements of fantasy. Winterson is without doubt a woman of rare intelligence and insight. Read this book!"
1,"th century classic It is almost criminal that a book this beautiful and this important is unread, and almost forgotten. Some of Serges fiction barely qualifies as such, written more as an essay than as a novel. Not so this. It does have an unusual structure, with each chapter focusing on a seperate character caught up in an absurd  but utterly terrifying  purge under Stalin. Yet each character is exquisitely drawn, with even the most despicable people rendered human and sympathetic in some way. The scenes, from a snowy Moscow night to a vast Siberian plain to a Spanish civil war hideaway, are stunningly evoked.This should be read with the best fiction of the last century, not consigned to the back shelves with cold war historical documents and Soviet oddities. Serge speaks to terror and freedom of thought, existential choices and the ability to reconcile oneself to imperfect realities. Utterly inspiring."
1,well coreographed display of talent the band has proved to be well informed in guitar and vocal extremities.they have proven to be well educated in solos and rythem guitaring. the band has made a remarkable improvement since their  album Kill em All.
1,"better So much better than How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb and they recorded and released it so close. Edge sounds great playing his old style guitar signature. Nice to hear the Eno strings in the background again just like in ...Streets Have No Name. And Bono... wait... where is Bono... ohhhh... this isnt U?!?Sorry I was very mistaken...... still, a very good album. Probably the best of the year so far. I am a U fan and an occasional Oasis fan  this blows Oasiss new album out of the water!TALK and A MESSAGE are stand out tracks upon my first few listens here.Cheers"

1,"Hold an amazing amount of stuff!! Great bag!!! I got this bag, and its larger counterpart, at my baby shower. I love these bags!This one holds more stuff than you would think! I can get  diapers, wipes, an outfit, toys, toiletries,  bottles,  jars of food, spoons, bib, burp rag, pacifiers, and a receiving blanket ALL IN THIS BAG AT ONCE! And then it still has room where I keep some Purell, her medical paperwork and some scented diaper disposal bags. I love that there is a separate food compartment, which is also insulated and it keeps things cold for a long time.i HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BAG! The color is neutral, cleans easily and doesnt show dirt easily, you would have to be really messy to make it look bad. And the strap adjusts a lot so you can wear it any way you want.A note on the matching larger bag  its great too, holds lots of stuff, I use it for overnight stays at Nanas house."
1,"make some popcorn and get some cokes,your in for a goodnight if you and your significant other dont have anything planned for the night, I recommend this movie for a entertaining evening. although, I do reccommend that you get the whole series. this movie is both scary and funny. if you like friday the , you are bound to enjoy this flick."
1,"A good movie, but with noticable mistakes I love the power glove, its so bad! I crack up every time i hear that saying. Its so lame. The tires being popped, remember that, look for the big mistake there. its funny, look for the knife  Whitewals! And the skateboar! I dont know how many times it dissapears and reapears. And lets not forget Corey getting hit by that girl that a crack that made haha! And how did jimmy know where the whistle was in Mario !!!!!"
1,"More than what i expected! Ive always hesitated to buy this CD because of all those bad stuff about Britney Spears. Just lately, I decided to buy it and guess what? Its a really good album! Her songs are upbeat  my favorites are Baby One More time, Crazy, sometimes, from the bottom of my broken heart, and email my heart This is a great Cd for any pop music fan! You dont have to like Britney Spears! If you like her music, then go ahead and get it, its all about music!"
1,"Quick Read, Big Adventure Avi seems to have done his research in this thrilleratsea. All of the sea terms are accurate and add a sense of reality to this girls dillemmas on board. Her parents seem a little undeveloped, but the sailors personalities are great. A good piece. Very entertaining historic fiction."
1,"Great Book I felt that this was an excellent book. It included interesting characters, a great plot, and what I felt was an outstanding ending. I liked the many obstacles the characters had to overcome to reach their goals and in a way the sad parts of the book. Although they were sad I felt they were necessary to really make the reader feel like they were part of the book a fellow mourner. Also, I loved the vivid descriptions Linda Sue Park gave of the beautiful setting, as well as the characters feelings and thoughts. Overall I felt that this was a great book that can be enjoyed by people of all ages."
1,"Harlan Coben is amazing! I have read several of Harlan Cobens novels and his novels are the only ones I will spend my time reading. He is an amazing writer, to say the least. I would recommend any of his novels to anyone who enjoys suspense thrillers with intriguing characters and plot twists galore!"
1,STARS I really enjoyed this novel. I was captured from the beginning and couldnt put it down. The characters were real with all their flaws and charms. The story was well woven with intrigue and romance. I would definitely read this author again.
1,"love this pot! i bought this pot from revolution tea as part of a gift pack. for myself the pot works fabulously and does not spill. But you can get it with  japanese tea cups and  sample tea bags for . at revolution tea, plus shipping, my Amazon Prime doesnt work for this so Im going to pay shipping either way  so instead of buying it here, Im going to go back to Rvolution Tea to buy another one. oh, one last thing, I have not tried it with loose tea yet, so my  stars is based on comfort to hold it, no dripping, style and stackability."
1,"GREAT movie! EXCELLENT movie.....just like all the other Harry Potter movies! I dont know why other people gave it a bad review! I LOVED it! Good thing I didnt go off other reviews on Amazon  not buy it, bc it was GREAT!"
1,"Great strap for the price I bought this strap for my Nikon D. It has a quick release feature which I like. I dont use a wrist strap to carry or hold on to my camera, but as a backup in case I was to lose my grip on it will shooting. I wouldnt feel comfortable letting my DSLR, especially with a zoom lens, dangle from it."
1,"Satisfy your hunger for the best The Jamisons have done it again. If anyone knows grilling and bbqing and entertaining its this amazing couple. This book is a great collection of classic recipes, many with an unsual twist. Not to mention the drinks, the rubs, marinades. Ilove to entertain out int he backyard, and I think its the best book on outdoor entertaining perhaps ever. Its a party from the very first page. I cant recommend it enough."
1,"Hagberg scores again. From the first Hagberg book I ever read, I have been a fan.Every book he writes grabs your attention from cover to cover.Not being an expert on all things Military or Intelligence, I dont worry about so called errors that may appear in books of this genre, after all it is a novel, and Hagberg, can get really close to the truth in his writings"
1,"ss Loved the story and the cover photo inspired me to WANT to read this book at firstglance..... Edward reminded me of my animals, both past and present. After reading thebook, I sent it to my Great Nieces, Sara  Jenna. I hope they enjoy it as much as I did.Keep up the good work Kate DiCamillo.From Toronto, Ontario, Canada, February ,  Groundhog Day"
1,"Christians who prayed for the troops in Iraq, read it! A truly moving book. The book starts its descriptions as the Marines are in Kuwait, soon to get the word to move into Iraq. It paints a portrait of the life of a soldier as they go into combatthe worries, what was faced in battle, etc. All throughout the author tells how prayers were answered in astounding ways. The last two chapters had me in tearsfirst, because surviving that last push seemed impossible, second, because God gave them His protection in such amazing ways."
1,"Students enjoy Eve Bunting and Unusual Illustrations My students were anxious to start reading and did not want tostop when the class was over. Here are some comments from my studentsat the Davis Elementary School in New Rochelle, NY. Faatima wrote When I read this book, I thought it was sad, pityful, and awful. How could they do that to their own neighborhood? Jerica wrote I enjoyed the story because it taught me something. You cant solve your problems by fighting. You have to talk before you burn down other peoples property. It was sad and uncalled for that people had no home and had to go to a shelter. Tiffany wrote I enjoyed reading this book, but it was sad. I would not want any of that stuff to happen in my neighborhood."
1,"MUST READ!!!!!!!!!! Stop the hand wringing about our future from the left and right, and get ready to start nodding in agreement with NEWT GINGRICH!!! Newt has outlined the challenges and SOLUTIONS that should dominate our nations dialogue. It is nothing short of amazing that he provides common ground for both sides to unite in this fascinating read."
1,Perhaps the most outstanding bassbaritone Ive heard. Great historical footage with Callas. An important historical DVD featuring the talents of one of the centuries great artists. This DVD is one of my most treasured.
1,"good pricequality ratio I bought this product for studio purposes at home. It does work well. I would not expected much more for the price. The contacts are golden, and it does not introduce much noise. I believe it is just right for the price I paid. I would give a second thought if I want to use this cable for other purposes, but for practise it is more than fine!."
1,Brita  Aqualux Pitcher Recieved in a timely manner. I am very satisfied with the product. One thing I would liked to have known in advance is how much water the pitcher holds after filtering. I couldnt find that information anywhere.
1,Perfect Little Teapot I wanted a small teapot sturdy enough for daily use but also pretty enough for company. This little teapot is just right for  people or  and is well constructed. Would buy more in the future if the need arises I collect teapots but wanted this one for function as well as form. Ruth Jane

Fast cars, amazing stunts,eye candy for everyone. Get this movie. You will not be disappointed. I have seen this movie multiple times and I see something new each time. Bluray quality of this movie is perfect. This makes a perfect gift for action lovers and fans of The Fast and Furious movies."
1,"Free Flowing from the Heart Natilie Goldberg inpires and motivates writers to be true to themselves and write from the heart. Ms. Goldbergs experience with her desire to connect with herself spills off the pages. She allows herself to be selfabsorbed in her work, and offers the reader wisdom from her past experiences. Her titles are humorous, and they help to build metaphors pertaining to writing. Goldbergs writing is easy and free flowing."
1,"Sweet from the single last train home, youre not expecting the cd to be as awesome and energetic as it is.Seriously, the cd grows on you each time you listen to it.My faves are Last Summer, Start Something, and Make a Move.The real thing that makes this one is how they switch from screaming to slow singing so smoothly. neway, if youve got extra cash, buy the cd instead of burning the song.itll be in high rotation."

1,"Awesome through and through If you ever wanted to learn more about time travel, pick up this book! Time A Travellers Guide combines mathematics with an intruiging plot. He weaves some nonfiction into the math and information to make it all the more interesting. I have had the privilige to contact Mr. Pickover myself and he is an amazing man! This book is one of the best I have read!"
1,"Very Good! Patty, is a coal miners daughter. These are the best of of all her hits. But I like the songs that are not here. The more blue grass, up in the hills kind a music. Thats where Patty belongs. But, hey, this biggest hits is very good. Very Good!Gif"
1,"A trip through a genius dreams With an eightstories sequence, Kurosawa expresses the magic of chilhood, the importance of perseverance and resistance, the beauty created by Van Gogh, war and atomic menace unleashed spreading their horror, and, last but maybe most important, hope an joy when the travel finishes. A film not to be seen once but many times, and getting amazed on each."
1,"Eurika! The name says it all. Eureka! At last I found it. This is an awesome little handheld vacuume.It has more power than my expensive upright vacuume and that is an understatement. I have had several cordless dust buster types but this beats them all. A very long cord makes it so handy and the on board storage for the crevice tool, the brush or just suction option and the wrap around cord storage make it effortless to use. I vacuumed my couch as soon as I got this little wonder and it amazed me what it picked up...I give it an A."
1,"James Bond  NightFire This game is a lot better than the other James Bond games. I love the new guns and gadgets. I reccomend this game for any fan of Bond or shooting games. The graphics are awesome, the fun factor is great, the cars are cool, and the different types of play are fun. All the levels are not just first person shooters. Multiplayer is the funnest compared to other shooters, but they need more unlocked characters in M team. Other than that, it is a fun game.  stars!"
1,"Superlatives do not exist Australia receives the UK distribution so we are ahead of Uncle Sam. As somebody else said in another review  it would be difficult for Mr Martin to go upwards from his first two volumes. Difficult or not, he did. This is fantastic stuff. Characters who are neither perfectly good or totally bad, characters who change, characters who DIE most unexpectedly. You come up gasping for breath after a session of reading. This is really good. I dont know if I can wait the year until the next volume and I both hope and dont hope that he will stop at six."
1,"Hover Disc The Hover Disc is a fun product providing many hours of enjoyment for kids as well as adults. It should be used in an open environment to prevent damage. However, it can be taped to maintain its fun interactive play."
1,"A good, and very disturbing book This was one of the few books I had to read for school, but that I really enjoyed. Its definitally not the kind of book you want to associate with and you dont wish to be any of the characters. I like the book because it is a good lesson about the nature of mankind the gradual loss of civilization as the highlycivilized English boys degrade to become savages. The murders they commit and the chanting and pig scenes are very shocking, but definiatally realistic. One question that came up im my class discussion Would a group of girls react the same way? Well, definitally a great book, that I can only recommend."
1,"Read The Teen Model Mystery!! This book was SO great!! People, if you are reading this, I strongly encourage you to read this book!...If readers read, then everyone that have careers will follow! my preschool teacher likes to say. If people cant read, then nobody would be able to do anything that has to do with literature. Fashion, modeling, action, mystery, and Nancy...the top five things that girls ABSOLUTELY love!!"
1,"Just an amazing read! This is probably the first textbook Ive read like a novel. I started on page , and just couldnt stop reading. For those that feel their veterinary cardiology skills may be subpar, this is a very good investment. It starts with anatomy, then physiology, normal then abnormal, and has entire chapters dedicated to different classes of drugs. It explains everything starting at the basics, so even those that have very little cardio knowledge will understand the text. The book also has color pictures included, along with color doppler ultrasound pictures for those that may be interested.This text is most highly recommended!"
1,"Pretty good book, I would recommend this book to a friend. I enjoy most of Crichtons books, they are usually unique and intriguing . I was surprised that he was able to still have more story left after Jurassic Park, but this book was equally entertaining."
1,"Very Helpful I passed this exam after studying with only this book. There were a few errors in it, and some of the information is slightly outofdate e.g., the IRA contribution limits listed are a few years out of date. Overall, however, I found it to be very useful and wellorganized."
1,"the best cordless weve owned Every feature behaves as expected, reception is great in both normal and speakerphone modes. The design allows to place the handset on a desk facedown and still communicate over the speakerphone without a problem. Whole family loves it, especially the intercom and the ability to read voice mail clearly from any of the handsets. The only drawback is overly bright light on the charging station at night. Motorola should dim that light according to the lighting conditions, or replace this stark blue with a red or amber LED."
1,"great duromed  aluminum reacher I was very pleased to find the reacher at Amazon.com I had looked everywhere. This style is the very best. You can pick up pennies, clothes. jars I use mine to put the cat food on the floor because I am in a wheelchair. I bought  afraid I might loose one again."
1,"Charming for children I found this video quite charming, and a very nice way to introduce children to Krishnas pastimes.Though it does appear to be mainly produced for children I also found it enjoyable, but then I love both cartoons and stories from the Vedas.The one I was sent was a VCD rather than a DVD, but it still worked fine in my player."
1,"Koestlers Philosophy In a tale of a disillusioned communist, Koestler tells his abstract and sometimes outrageous thoughts and answers to questions about human nature. Set primarily in a prison, this novel focuses on the life of Rubashov, a controversial political figure thrown in jail for crimes he didnt commit. While imprisoned, Rubashov reflects on his life and what he has stood for. He begins to question his beliefs. By reflecting many of his beliefs through his characters, we are allowed a glimpse into the mind of Koestler, who himself became disillusioned with the Party. Though simply written, this entertaining novel offers a look at Koestlers life and some historical background on the party. Fueled by Koestlers own philosophical insights, the novel tells an interesting tale about the communist Soviet Union."
1,Great for a student I would recommend anyone going to school have one of these. I bought this for my wife  years ago and have had no problems. It holds hours of lectures and is easy to operate. Battery lasts a good amount of time and batteries are easy to find and cheap to replace. My wife is not the easiest on electronics and it has held up to her abuse just fine. She even had friends asking to use it for their classes as well
1,"WHOS BEST!!! Thier finest effort without a doubt!!! The band is in peak form in this album!!!

1,"Afterburn GREAT. Zane writes wonderful, colorful, realistic novels. I cant wait for part II. This should be made into a movie showing how black love really is. Zane keep up the good work. I will always be a fan!!!"
1,"Not quite what I expected, but still good. This book is, as its title might indicate, not instructions on how to pickup women.But never the less it provides a good insight in the type of society the Pick Up Artists work in, and it make me look at the world just a little bit differently.For tips on picking up women I recomment David DeAngelos courses available on DVD and downloadable PDFs and all Mysterys material only available as PDF"
1,My son does everything but slep with it.... I bought it for my  year old because I cant seem to get him to use the real  one.Actually my son is  and has had it for a year and I would bet he has pushed it for  miles following me around the yard. If you have a toddler that likes bullbozers and dumpstrucks then this is your toy.
1,"EXCELLENT Reading! I have read all the BainbridgeMontgomery books and this latest one is the VERY best. I highly recommend it. The story line is very interesting, the characters are well defined, and the plot is exciting. Have great anticipation for the next book!"
1,"Unbelievable! My first reaction when seeing the three DVDs was Youve got to be kidding! However, my roommate asked me to have a little bit of faith in her. So, I sat down and watched it. It is an amazing movie. I always wondered what happend to Cinderella and Snow White after she and their respective Princes got married. This did it for me. Thank you and please let there be a sequel."
1,Great book This is a great book. It is fun and easy to read.I already have my own trading style so I didnt get much from one of his Ms which he refers as Method. The rest of two Ms Mind and Money part reminded me whats important to keep in mind while I am trading.
1,"mugs are great !  shipper? not so much These Signature Housewares Boscoware mugs are great  heavy glazing, large size, sturdy, and stylish.The shipper, however, did a horrible job of packing them. Six of the  mugs were broken.Fortunately,  of the price was refunded to me. However, apparently there are no more of these mugs available, and Id wanted all . Sigh."
1,"Thank God Shes Back!! Many will say this is not the regular I Found Jesus, Give Me Something To Hold On To, Oh How Precious and yes UNCLOUDY DAY Myrna Summers but I say since she has Found Jesus, and she has Something To Hold On To, because the name of Jesus is Precious and there is an Uncloudy Day ahead. She NOW SAYS HIS MERCY ENDURETH FOREVER. The tracks on this CD ministers to your needs. My favorite cant be limited to one There Is A River Higher Places. If youll looking for the GOSPEL IN SONG this is your CD"
1,"Lovelier the second time around To my mind, what separates an excellent film from a good film is the bonus of being able to view it over and over again without it becoming stale. You continue to be entertained and find yourself discovering elements of the plot and aspects of the characters that you missed on previous viewings. Shakespeare in Love, with its clever plot and rich writing, meets that criterion. You have to keep your eyes and ears open to catch all the fun. Even background players in the street scenes shout out inside jokes, like lines from Shakespeares plays. Anyone who enjoys Shakespeare will love this film.Production values are excellent, scenery and costumes lush, sound and score fine. The cast is more than up to the task of creating Elizabethan England. Youll find Gwyneth Paltrow a wonder. What a delight to find a young American actress, aside from Meryl Streep, who can handle an English accent convincingly.I rarely buy films on DVD, but I had to own this one."
1,"life saver Wonderful product. Able to eat dairy again. Without this product I used to get terribly sick. Now I can eat milk products ice cream, cheese, etc as long as I take this product right before. You do not need water. Very convenient. Great taste. Not all lactose products are created equal. By far this seems to work the best."
1,"Works well ,but... The cover protects the phone well, but you have to remove it to access the recharge port. The snap is a little tight when you first put it on, but is adequate after it is used some. The whole thing was worth the purchase price until body glove makes one for it."
1,"Criminally Underrated While I prefer the younger, funkier Muddy Waters with his moaning voice in full swing, this album is by no means the abomination that it has been lambasted as for so many years. In fact, I prefer it to the muchhyped Fathers and Sons Waterspartial Butterfield Band teamup of several years later.Is it experimental? Sure, theres plenty of s fuzz, reverbecho and effects going on here.Is it still blues? Absolutely, blues is not defined as an idiom by the way one amplifies guitars or filters vocals.Is it good? Yes, in fact it apporaches greatness at several points in the album, particularly when compared to the classic albums of rock psychedelia of its era.If you enjoy Muddy Waters with his bands and dislike late s rock and roll, you will not like this album. Unfortunately, most of the blues critics of the time fell into this catagory and hence this albums ridiculous reputation. If you can see beyond the rigid catagorization of musical artists, this album is for you."
1,"this is truley English Have you seen the remains of the day? Do you love pastel colors, a relaxed atmosphere, antiques and softly printed fabrics? Then this is a book you might like. The choice of pictures is excellent and even after  years I still keep looking into this book. Every page is illustrated and the photos are sooo lovely. It is mostly about fabrics and colors though. If you are interested in HOW to decorate I recommend decorating with antiques, which explains the structure of a well balanced room and furniture better. Nonetheless, this book will make you contemptuos of other peoples homes. I hope you are not arrogant....."
1,"Great Series This book is a great coninuence of Roses. Daisys involved in sports school, and now has a boyfriend and a job. Its amazing she got throught it all. But afew minor derails as her path through life continues. Dont read Laurel or Lily before you read this book. I read Daisy, Rose, Lily and Im still waiting on Laurel, Its hard to get these book since they are no longer in publish. My dad owns a book company and hes having trouble, but he found It...Just waiting for It to get in. If you need a book, aepbooks.com will find it for you. Amazing book, Daisy is my favorite. Read this book, and then pass it down to a little sister or a neighbor. Theyll love it too."
1,"Its very addicting! I cant stop playing! Ive been a Zoo Tycoon fan for a long time now, but just got this game a couple months ago and the Endangered Species expansion. The D graphics are neat and animations are variedits fun to just watch the animals and people. I love the challenge gamesthey are really challenging! There are a few bugs that get annoying such as games locking up during some challenges, etc, but nothing major. After I installed the expansion pack, I also noticed the graphics were a bit choppy and the speed was slightly lagged.Overall, though, I would suggest this game for the whole family. There is really good information there about each species and it can be very educational and fun!"
1,"Pricey but better than the flat lid This lid fits classic AllClad  inch skillets perfectly not sure if it fits the newer, cheaper French skillet. I have both the Nonstick D and Stainless version which came with flat lids. The flat lid works but the domed lid gives your food extra room so it doesnt get smashed and allows condensation to move toward the edge of the pan. Dishwashes perfectly. I only wish that it came with the pans from the getgo."
1,"Fond Memories I remember watching this movie decades ago. Just recently, Ive decided to buy many old classics in film and this movie is one of them. For over  decades, I could still recall certain scenes from the movie, especially the crafts landing on the moon. I cant really add anything new to the discussion of this film. Its a very nicely produced classic film and withstands the test of time quite well. Buy it!"
1,"My kids like this story. A very pleasant book to read to the kids around Christmas. I have two daughters,  and , and they both really enjoyed me reading them is story. It would be great for children younger and older, as well. In fact, I really enjoyed reading it to them!"
1,"Bubbles sings so well! First, I should remind you that this is a concert performance from almost  years ago, rather than a fully staged opera.The singing here is remarkable. Claire Watson gives Ariadne a strong, confident voice. Beverly Sills sings Zerbinetta with an easy, ebullient grace that teaches us why she acquired the nickname, Bubbles.If youre already familiar with Ariadne, this Original  Version provides dialog that was left out especially for Zerbinetta in later versions.If you are looking for a staged opera performance, you would do better to start with Jessye Norman and Kathleen Battle and the Met, or Susan Anthony and the Dresden State Operaboth of these are excellent staged performances.If youre already hooked on Strauss, and are just looking to see how Beverly Sills sings Zerbinetta, then this will be exciting for you. I just didnt want anyone to be disappointed if they were expecting the staged version."
1,Not the best way to get this Harp I purchased this harp prior to this order alone.. and got a better quality stand and books of my choice. The CDs were oddly not music for this harp. Good instrument. Poor package. My opinion only.
1,"So much for just trying to get away from it all... This book is almost set up as two short stories, the first being on the shipisland where Lola and Max get to know each other, and the second back home where they join forces to take down an unauthorized internet site being run by Lolas ex.Lola is a former bulimic model turned healthy lingerie business owner. The book takes a realistic look at Lolas bulimia and her struggle to recover. Max is a security consultantundercover operative having a really bad day when he meets Lola by commandering the boat shes sleeping on to get away from drug lords who want him dead. Oh yeah, she has her yippy dog, Baby Doll, along with her.Lola and Max have inner demons to face as well as real live bad guys the drug lord and her ex. They face them together and fall in love in the process. A fun read for the summer."
1,"Impressive Just happened to stumble upon The Faceless on myspace, heard  songs off the album, Pestilence, An Autopsy and The Ghost of a Stranger. Im very please with the technical side, being that it isnt so technical that it becomes absurd, but there is enough to make you understand the capability of this band. The guitars are great, very precise riffing and pleasantly melodic solos. Dare I say they are in the same vain as Death, well you can hear influences anyway. As far as the bass player goes, lets just say that somewhere near the end of Ghost of a Stranger, he plays a bass riff that made my hairs on my arm stand up. Marco Pitruzzella does a great job on the drums with nice th note dbl bass, gravity blast beats, extremely fast fills. Great job guys, I cant wait to hear the rest of this album!"
1,"A life saver for those who are hard on their MP player I am a big fan of cases that can clip onto my belt or pants. This case not only has a great, sturdy clip, but is very functional. All the main buttons are easy to access. If you want to put the player on hold you have to undo the Velcro at the top, but it isnt too hard to do. The clip is really strong, which is a big plus since I was constantly dropping my old e that I didnt have a case for. I am sure if I had this case my other SanDisk e wouldnt be resting in peace.I love how the screen is protected with plastic, but that that the wheel is still easily accessible did I mention I am hard on my toys?The sides are made of a stretchy material so it is easy to remove the player if need be, but the Velcro fastener is really strong that I dont think the player would fall out accidentally.I havent used the armband yet, but it seems pretty sturdy. And you cant beat the price!"
1,"a film with heart I would recommend Carolina as an entertaining, yet thought provoking film that focuses on the true nature of love, in all of its incarnations. It is a wonderful comedy with a great feeling for the relationships among the characters. Punctuated with sharp yet thoughtful dialogue, I found myself wanting more of it when the credits rolled.Carolina is primarily story of the character Carolina Julia Stiles, the oldest of three motherless and mostly fatherless girls being raised by their eccentric grandmotherShirley MacLaine. Despite the less than ideal circumstances of her childhood, Carolina has managed to pull herself up by her own bootstraps. But instead of leaving her less than perfect family behind her she chooses to embrace them and keep them an integral part of her life. This key plot point is a large part of what makes Carolina head and shoulders above what might otherwise be another mundane romantic comedy."

1,"Arranged by the Rolling Stones Whenever someone grills me as to why I think Brian Jones was the guiding light of the Rolling Stones, I always direct them to Gomper. The last twothirds of this tune, while credited to JaggerRichard, are undoubtedly of Brian Jones inspirationand a total freakout by secondonlytotheBeatles standardsfollowed by  LightYears from Home, which is equally indebted to Jones, as is the subsequent On with the Show. Beyond this, Their Satanic Majesties Request is the last Stones album to bear the following five words Arranged by the Rolling Stones. What this means is that apart from, perhaps, Child of the Moon, what is to come is just so much Glimmer Twinsstyle musical excrement. Try whistling Ruby Tuesday next to HonkyTonk Women and youll know what I mean."
1,What a great book I highly recommend this book for any family that has a member with an addiction. It shows how it is truly a family disease. You see it from both the addict a nd the mothers view. Very well written and inspiring.
1,"Great forgotten music Just on a whim I bought this recording to see what all the hoopla was about Sal Mineo. What a suprise! With each time listening throught the CD, I found the songs more and more enjoyable. What a rare find. Now im looking for all his recordings from all labels.The sound quality is excellentincluding the stereo recordings given the vintage of these sessions. My old s of his pale in comparison!!If youre at all in doubt about this compilationdont!"
1,a room of my own  loved it!!! This story is a very compelling look at young girl and her family during the depression era. Her life is turned upsidedown and takes us along for the ride. I loved the story and would definitely recommend it to other people.
1,"Vice city is the best game ever!!! Vice city is the best ps game in the world everyone thinks its so violent but maybe its violent for them but not me i mean everyone has blood so how is blood bad what about violents it is only violent because there is shooting and carjackin and even though it has sexuality...but all it is, is girls walking around in bikinis wow i see peope in bikinis at the beach you should be atleased  because all of the  year olds and up have had sexed class and so we know what this game is about this game has been voted the best rental,the best selling game, and the best game"
1,"GNR Hits While not the biggest Axl Rose fan, I am a huge Slash fan. This album puts their biggest hits from the original group on one album. It sucks that they didnt stick together. I would consider them the last great hair metal band since grudge kinda took off right as they broke up."
1,Proud Of our Spiritual Heritage I received this book as a gift and now I give it to all my friends. The book helps people explore their spirituality and how it can be used in the everyday world around them. I am happy not only to learn about our ancestors philosophy but it gives me great pride to share their knowledge with others seeking to improve themselves. DO not just read this book but practice what the author advocates in your daily life. It is True Power in a small package.
1,"Good bath seat I purchased this for my father who has become ill and has become less and less able to stand in the shower to bathe. The larger seats with backs are too wide for a standard tub and this one fits perfectly. I only wish this one hs a back as well since sitting upright unassisted has become increasingly more difficult. Otherwise, the quality and size has worked well as well as the ease of getting it in and out of the tub."
1,"Basic slide viewer This certainly works in the sense that you put a slide in and it lights up and you see the slide, but the light is not all that bright. Considering that it is cheap and basic, however, no complaints."
1,"BEAUTIFUL, HAUNTING MELODIES FROM A MASTER SONGSMITH This CD should come with a warning YOU MAY BECOME ADDICTED TO THESE MELODIES! I can listen to this stuff before sleep its a great CD to doze off to and then wake up in the morning and the haunting melodies are still abuzz in my head. Although the lyrics are flaky at times, the beautifully crafted melodies and wonderful, relaxed feel of the music make this a worthwhile purchase for everyone who enjoys good, clear tuneful music. And to think this guy has been a grandfather for some time now! Anyway, Donovan is one of those rare musicians whose voice and style have not changed with the years..."
1,"A great read about reading It is truely amazing the things we take for granted in the United States. This book is about how emotions and situations that occur in the great books of fiction litature are so interesting to those in Iran. The author teaches a group of students about western litature and at the same time liberates there minds from the confining circumstanes that they find themselves in Tehran. This book really opened my eyes as to the extremely challenging environment of living day to day in Tehran. Also, it shows how fortune we are in the west to have access to great works of literture."
1,"I DID NOT PUT THIS DOWN This book, along with the other three in the series, captured my full attention and did not let it go until I had read the entire  pages in the Enchanted Forest Chronicles. I got it on a Friday and kept reading until my eyes would not stay open, I woke up Early Saturday and, well, read the entire thing. It is one of the absolute best books I have ever read with an original plot. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did."
1,"RAPPIN  ROLLIN Trailer Load A Girls triggers off a rollercoaster of rhythms and rap, mostly unintelligible. Gun Pon Me and Flesh Axe are particularly raucous, the formers only discernible words being jezebel, prostitute, mongrel and theres a definite preoccupation with ladies throughout, as evidenced by titles like Woman Tangle and A Mi Di Girls Dem Love. Maxi Priest lends some respectability as he duets with Shabba on the radiofriendly Housecall, while the closing track, The Jam, features KRS of Boogie Down Productions. Shabba rants about his hero Yellowman on Where Does Slackness Come From?, and about blue movies and reality, casually dropping profundities like Me I went to high schoolWas once a prefectTook some great subjects English and mathematicsBut my greatest subject was sex. FistARis. As subtle as an air raid yet affectionate in a naive sort of way. Its all the excitement of ska and early reggae returned, infused with a very positive vibration."
1,"biting, clever  unconventional The first writingdirecting feature for Tim Robbins The Player, Shawshank Redemption is a biting mocumentary on the functioning of American politics. Robbins plays Bob Roberts, a wouldbe senator, followed across the US by a British documentary crew during his campaign to be elected to Congress where he will ratify the use of US military forces in The Gulf. The problem is, Bob Roberts is a fanatic rightwing racist already renowned for his racially discriminatory folk music.While many will be put off by the unconventional nature of the film, and American pride is sure to be wrangled by a lot of what this film says, Bob Roberts is nevertheless a fantastic watch and a great predecessor to more successful films such as Primary Colors. If you have any interest in the machinations of American domestic politics or racial discrimination then this is a film worth owning for repeat viewings."
1,My quilting Bible I got this book at a discount price at Hobby Lobby.. Wow what a bargin... Tons of information... Loads of pictures... If your a new quilter like myself... This book is at a good price with all the imformation you will need to start out... plus stars for the Author..
1,"GREAT MEMORIES! I remember watching these Spiderman episodes as a kid when they originally came out, and they really bring back some great momories. My two little girls love them! The color and transfer quality look superb on my HDTV plasma. I noticed that some of the later episodes were NOT cleaned up, however, as a few people already mentioned. The sound was also very rough on some random episodes that were not cleaned up  maybe they were locked in the vaults too tight! My only other critique is that through the menuing system that was set up, you are forced to watch the episodes continiously as they run together, even if you pick out one single episode they just keep going from there. The packaging was FIRST CLASS, and befitting a collectors set such as this. All in all, a great set!"
1,Encapsulated creativity Maira Kalman does a wonderful job of capturing her readers imagination and eye. She has a very playful graspe of the English language. Her style is envigorating. Children and adults are captivated by the rhythmic storytelling. The colorful illustrations make it hard to turn the pages while the text spurs the reader on to do just that. This is an entirely delightful childrens book that will give readers the travel bug.
1,Nice and cheap. This little box is not expensive compared to other automated ones. Its very affordable and hassle free. I have two cats. I still need to clean out small peaces every week and change litter every other. Over all its makes things a little bit easier and cleaner. If my old box got to dirty the cats would pee outside the box. This solved that issue.Update Had this a few years now. Still works great. One cat went blind and is still able to use it just fine. I think the low noise from the motor might help him locate the box. I would recommend this to other people with blind cats.
1,"Accountability I have had many pedometers over the years and strive to get at least the , steps per day recommended by the American Heart Association. I have also lost a lot of pedometers, so I appreciate the clip on the Omron. Although pedometers can be bulky, whether tucked in a pocket or clipped on a waistband, this is less cumbersome than most.The real benefit is that you download the information and have graphs to show the number of stepsaerobic stepswhether youve achieved your goal etc. This puts the accountability right out there I find that very motivating."
1,"The crash is incredible... Gotta admit I wasnt looking forward to this one. My buddy suggested it, and I went along for the ride  and what a ride it is!The acting is soso  but this film is not built on acting. Vin Diesel, however, is perfect as Riddick and the rest of the cast works well together at least.The script is also average  certainly interesting, but not overly intelligent.What got me about this film, was the cinematography  just an excellent picture in that aspect. As far as I was concerned, this is what made the movie. The bright lights, the planet, the crash, were all incredible shots, and superbly put together.Give it a shot  even if this isnt your sort of flick. Its pretty darn good."
1,"Good Sampling Of Alice but wheres the hits? This box set has a lot of good matieral on it however I was very disappointed to find that only a few of his best hits are included in here and I did not buy it. If you want a sampling of his music over his long career get this but if you want his best hits get The Best Of Alice Cooper Mascara  Monsters, and Alice Cooper Super Hits a cheap Compilation if u can find it here on amazon and save yourself some money."
1,"A litle dinky, but price was so great I cannot complain There are rhythm sticks out there that are a little longer and sturdier, but they are more than twice the price. I needed a lot of these and they fit the bill beautifully. Great value for the price, just not the nicest youll ever find."
1,"Love Prog rock? then you must love it. I could not believe it that it is the first album of King Crimson. That time Prog rock was in its formation state and this album made the path. out of  songs  are my all time favourite. st century, epitaph and in the court of. In my point of view the Prg rock went to its max height with Thick As a Brick by Jethro Tull, but if there were no In the court of crimson king it could have been too tough to reach that height.Listen to it. You will love it."
1,"Another great CD I have loved the music of Prokofiev since I was a toddler, so I naturally jumped at the chance to hear Joshua Bell perform his violin sonatas. Im glad I did. Joshua Bell, as always, makes the pieces come alive with the kind of depth and emotion and lyricism that you dont find all at once in other violinists. The first sonata on the CD, the one in F minor, is my favorite. In it, Bell really brings out the haunting quality of the piece, and yes, he is more than capable of putting a little elbow grease in the Allegro brusco movement, making it convincingly brutal. Mustonen and Bell move together as one on this recording, and IMO, he is a much better accompanist for Bell than Simon Mulligan, who accompanies Bell for recitals in the US. This is a CD worth having."
1,"Excellent instrumentals When I first bought a CD player a few years back, Ghost and Other Great Hits by Spectrum was one of the first  CDs I bought. It has remained one of favorites over the years.Spectrum does a wonderful job turning some good songs mostly vocal into flowing instrumentals."
1,"Triple TakeTiple AWESOME this book is amazing, once you start reading you are hooked on every word, i paid more attention to this book than the TV that was on in the same room. a must read for anyone who likes a book where you think"
1,Worth the reading time if you are a lover of African studies Richards translates sucessfully the complex background history of the current Sierra Leonean crisis into a quantified language suitable for further policy research and study on similar models. His threading of Sierra Leonean nation state history with the ongoing conflict makes his work more active. It is a great upgraded handbook for readers who seek to demystify the African learning experience. In that same light Richards book lacks emotional connection with panAfrican political ideology.Read it.
1,"Brilliant pieces of urban poetry! I love romantic and majestic poems, which is why I hadnt anticipated liking this particular collection of poetry, for it deals with urban political themes. However, City of Coughing and Dead Radiators is a true masterpiece. Martin Espada has put together a collection of poems that deal with the harsh realities of being raised in the ghetto, with an ironic twist. I love Cockroaches of Liberation  truly one of the best pieces of poetry ever written. With unflinching honesty and elegant prose, Espada has created an ingenious piece of work. I am duly impressed with this book..."
1,wonderful I bought this thinking it was just a regular photo album but i was delighted to see all the pictures and room for photos of different sizes. The ribbon tie is a great touch and it is sure to last for years to come in out new home.
1,"Amazing music Ever since I read the Last Herald Mage trilogy, I wanted to hear the songs based around Vanyel and the songs he sang like My Ladys Eyes. I saw this on Amazon and was thrilled, then I saw the high prices of the used copies the sellers were selling. I was saddened, and didnt give up hope, and found it cheaper from the original publisher. Anyway, the review of the actual music. Heather Alexander has an amazing voice. I can just imagine her as a Bard in Valdemar singing about Vanyel hundreds of years after the trilogy and telling his tale. I purchased several more Heralds of Valdemar CDs and found them all to be great, but nothing is as good as this one. If you buy only one album based on Lackeys lyrics, buy this one."
1,"Good but not the best! This book is a good resource for learning ASL signs. While it does do a good job introducing beginners to ASL phrases and also displays the difference between ASL and Signed Exact English often mistaken for ASL, it does not explain the grammar rules of ASL. The point being that, after one has learned the signs in the book, one has no way of knowing how to form other phrases on their own. Instead of teaching the method, this book teaches memorization. This is okay sometimes but for those who REALLY want to learn the language and become fluent, it is not enough. To learn ASL grammar, I would recommend American Sign Language A Teachers Resource Text on Grammar and Culture by BakerShenk and Cokely. All in all, this book is pretty good and is much better than many other resources out there, its just not enough."
1,"Makes You Feel. This band deserves mainstream recognition. Rogue works hard, and is such a wonderful artist, not to mention the rest of the band. This album was so influential for me. Im a writer and after I listened to this on the way to what was high school for me back then Im writing this review kind of late after first hearing it I wrote so much more. Its spiritual, romantic, emotional, and has an Egyptian feel and tone to it all. Ive seen them live and cried in Rogues arms. This album also got me through some very hard times, along with their previous album, Telemetry of a Fallen Angel. I dont want to say much on the genre because it really transcends labels. It has music and lyrics that will make you feel and help you find yourself. What more could you ask for from this album? What more could you ask for from life?"
1,"Outstanding CD The Buena Vista thing, as wonderful as it is, is a little played out. This is something different  its folksy and tropical, a real breath of fresh air. Jazzy, guitarry, elegant, cool. So if youre looking for Buena Vista, and only for Buena Vista type recordings, you may not like this. But I suspect that most will be blown away by this original CD anyway."
1,"One of the few... There are only a handful of films that treat this subject in a thoughtful and serious manner and this is one of them. The filmmaker does a good job providing the viewer with a historical backdrop of Psi phenomena and research while also exploring some of the most important work happening in the field today. Although the subject matter is addressed with an appropriately objective and scientific sensibility, the film itself has a very personal feel and the filmmaker finds a good balance between skepticism and openmindedness, an approach that will feel comfortable for most viewers not already intimately aware of this amazing phenomena. I wish there were more films out there like this one."
1,"A Child is born and love is made....ALIVE! This album is teh sick! The first time I listened to it, nothing really stuck out. It was just...ok. Now it freakin rocks! God...especially the end of the second disc. If it doesnt bring tears to your eyes...youre not human. It doesnt matter if its been done bofore of if the story is somewhat cliched. It still works and is fun! That is all that matters!Best tracks Stranger in a Strange Land, Wind at my Back, Welcome to NYC, Open wide the Flood Gates, geez...i guess ALL OF THEM!"
1,"LOVED this trilogy These three books have been without a doubt my favorites! The Lytton family bring together every physical emotion with one central character and the family publishing company. The location is mainly in London and expands to New York City. I seemed to have attached myself to everyone in the family and felt their grief and happiness through the War Years. Birth, death, affairs ... all were part of the makeup of this trilogy. Youll have trouble putting the book down!"
1,"Classic Candy, as Great as Ever! Come on, theyre lifesavers! You know what they are, and that theyre delicious! Might as well get a bulk discount here, rather than getting oneshots in the grocery store checkout line. Its like a yearround version of those lifesaver Christmas books!"
1,Color Challenge This book taught me the ability to mix colors unlike any bookIve ever used or learned from before.It was a delightful experience.Much like a very needed vacation away from stress.I had so much funwith this form of art  painting.I wish this author would publish more.
1,"An enthralling saga from beginning to end After Dark is the unabridged audiobook rendition of a suspenseful novel following Lydia Smith, licensed paraarchaeologist, trying to earn an honest living working for Shrimptons House of Ancient Horrors, a rockbottom lowbudget museum. But bizarre things keep happening... a dead body appears in the sarcophagus exhibit, and her latest client turns out to be one of the most ruthless men in the city! Narrated by Audie Award winning actress Joyce Bean, After Dark is an enthralling saga from beginning to end.  CDs,  hours  minutes."
1,Bramwell  a view of Victorian London Brilliant series which illustrates the prejudices of Victorian England against educated women. Also graphically shows medical practices of the time and the attitude to the poor. Combining this with excellent acting and costuming make this a series worthy of recommendation.
1,"Good. Can improve design Certainly nice and durable. Design can be improved through logical thinking. Instead of too many small pockets, more number of bigger pocket. Overall utility is . No doubt in my mind, it will last till I am bored of using it."
1,"AT HIS PEAKE McGrath has the dexterity of a surgeon when it comes to crafting supberb psychological suspense and highly unique characters. And Martha Peake is no exception, and finds McGrath at his finest. Martha Peake is a brilliantly moving, darkly disturbing, and unforgettable tale from the master of modern Gothic"
1,"Very Satisfying Cinema All in This Tea is a modest film well worth the attention of all who take pleasure in a wellcrafted, informationfilled documentary. The subject here is David Lee Hoffman who over time created a significant tea importing business out of a vagabond love of Asia and an appreciation for fine, handcultivated tea. All in This Tea also includes sublime footage of rural China and an exploration of the difficulties of functioning effectively in that country as an American entrepreneur. Replete with a cameo appearance by erstwhile Les Blank documentary subject Werner Herzog, All in This Tea provided this viewer with a highly enjoyable hour of entertainment and edification."
1,Classic sports comedy This is one of the classics. Who are these people giving this film  star? Are they too uptight to understand the humour. The story is great  anyone who has been invlolved in minor league hockey should enjoy this movie. I was invlolved in Roller Hockey for  seasons and this movie captures the mood and essence of minor league hockey players and their happygo lucky spirit about the game of hockey and the game of life. The story within the story captures todays sports world. The team owners threats to move the team to Florida have become a reality in the s.
1,"Good Music! I really enjoy New Creations music. They have their own sound. It sounds like  voices. The songs they sing are dynamic and very expressive. During supper, after church well just pop in the Jericho Project and relax. This is just GOOD MUSIC!"
1,A refreshingly useful business book for all readers This book should be read by anyone who leads people or would like to. The screenplay skills of the author are evident in the illustritive story of Andrew O Briens struggle as a young CEO. This book will make you rethink some things.
1,"Simple but elegant Surprisingly simple but an elegant, functional design. When I first saw it I said, Well this is not much. but its design and functionality belies its simplicity. It works perfectly. I may order another one to use with other items."
1,"difficult to put down I recd a kindle in November as a present. At first I was skeptical, I am an avid reader. I thought how can I get used to this? When you read a book there is the way it feels, looks, smells, etc. It is so easy to lose yourself in a good book. It took a few days, but I now have trouble going back to a book. The kindle takes a little while to get used to, but once you do its hard to put down or go back to a paper book. The only problem I have with the kindle is that it is too difficult to share a book you love. I believe there is a way but the other person needs to have a kindle too. The kindle is easy to use, easy to get used to and has an extremely wide variety of books.Kindle Amazons Wireless Reading Device"
1,Lost In Queens David Bixler This CD is an enjoyable mix of bebop and contemporary styles to form a sort of NYC nd street sounding small ensemble. The color of Bixlers alto and Wendholts trumpet is used quite tastfully and it is a subtle mix of standards and originals. Anyone wanting a sort of jazz now in their ears should feel welcome to pick this up.
1,"this is awsome !!!!! This is by far one of my favorite shows on TV. This show is very funny and one of the first shows that delt with a lot of teen issues and others, the first and second are when they are in Middle school, which is really cool, you kind of get to watch them grow, the erd season when it comes out should take place in High school. I have seen every single episode many times over and over, LOL, but I will continue to do so, because the show is that dam good. But dont take my word for it, BUY IT, YOU WILL NOT BE DISSAPOINTED...."
1,Love These Diapers! We have been using these diapers since our son was born. He is now  months and we are still using them. They are just as good as Pampers or Huggies but without the awful chemicals. Plus I love the fact that they are just plain brown. My baby has gone green!
1,"Great Basketbal Hoop The basketball hoop took some time in the setup process but was very easy to do. This is probably one of the best basketball hoops I have owned and my kids just love it. Even though it is a portable, with the tempered glass backboard and you fill the base full with water or sand, it feels just like an inground hoop setup. No movement or swaying from side to side. Great basketball equipment."
1,"Great for the office I really wanted to get a glass  personalized business card holder and when I chose this product, I thought it would be lack luster on my cubicle. As it turns out, the Acrylic looks very clean and I like the fact that I didnt spend too much money on it. It holds plenty of business cards and looks very professional.I highly recommend it for someone that doesnt want to opt for a cheap wire business card holder but still wants to achieve a business professional look or spend a lot on a over the top card holder. This is the right choice."
1,"Weighty Spiritual Treatise This work by one of the most famous and influential Eastern Christian saints, Gregory Palamas, is really rather fantastic. The Introduction by Mr. Rogich is very good, as are the notesfootnotes throughout the book. Thankfully the publisher andor Mr. Rogich did not feel it necessary to shorten the notes, but allowed for lengthy ones, and thankfully right at the bottom of the page. The Treatise itself touches most of the spiritual concepts that one might be concerned about meekness, sexuality, gluttony, mourning, vainglory, asceticism, etc. As usual, St. Gregory is very insightful and profound. This book, however, is not really a good beginners introduction to Orthodox thought on these matters, but is more for those who already have built a solid spiritual foundation by living an Orthodox life."
1,"Booger! I consider myself a serious gamer....And Boogerman is in my collection of Sega Genesis cartridges. Lets be honest, its a ridiculousfunny title  character. Sounds like its fun to play,  it is pretty fun. My yr old son  I play this game every month or so when I break out the Genesis. But this is a game weve never really got too far into the levels.....Its not that hard of a game. But its just kind of confusing at times. Trying to figure out where to go to advance to the next level, ect... I still love having the game in my game collection. And would recommend getting it if you, a family member, or friend is a gamer of old school to current systems."
1,"Great Book, but better for older toddlers We have a growing collection of Dr. Seuss books for our montholds, and I can find something unique and educational in every one of them, this one included. I do think that, for children just learning language, the alliteration may be a bit of a negative  while they are working hard to understand and say individual words for different objects, the rhymes in this book make everything sound the same. I know this will be a hit for the kids when they are a bit older and have a more solid command of the vocabulary, but I find it not to be the MOST appropriate for my very young toddlers."
1,"Chocobo Racing I have played this game for  or  months now and even though I have never played a Final Fantasy game, this game is excellent!! It has very good music and the characters are even excellent! The tracks are challenging and is far better than CTR Racing.  of the hidden characters is even faster than even your edited racers even you get the  points in Story Mode. All in all, this is a very good game to try out, or buy if you can find it."
1,"PepperPad I liked the Pepperpad but it was not very sensitive to WiFi signals. Because of this, I returned the unit and am awaiting a refund.With the price of laptops dropping and having full compatibility with everything on the Web, I found the Pepperpad an expensive unit with little usefulness. The instant on and infrared remote features were in its favor but again, the weak WiFi capability caused me to say good bye to the Pepperpad."
1,My daughter loves this one too We bought Thinkin Things Collection  and Millies Math House as a package. Both items have been really helpful tools for my  year old preschool daughter. This is pretty good edutainment for her. I would recommend this item for preschoolers.
1,"Friends finally on blu....Could This BE any...... AWESOME! Yes it is. Ordered it on Saturday and received it today!Now to get something straight these are the Broadcast episodes!!! Now Ive been watching this amazing set, and Im barely on season , but so far Im not missing the extended cuts. There are three reasons.. These episodes are the way these episodes were meant to be seen!!. All the episodes are stunning in blu ray. There are a few episodes extended and the original The One Where Ross Tells Rachel in its unedited glory.Bottom line Friends are finally on Blu enjoy!!! For all the bad reviews out there own the set and then write your reviews. All the negative reviews are swaying fans from purchasing this awesome friends set!!You get all  seasons, HI DEF, and a chalk load of extras!!!!Quit complaining and enjoy that we get Friends on blu ray!"
1,"MGM does a wonderful job on this classic This DVD has it all from director commentary, to a featurette, conceptual art, tv spots, and theatrical trailers. All of them are very interesting and informitive to the films fans. The only thing that I thought was missing was deleated scenes, but maybe they originally used all of the footage. Its really cool to veiw the artwork and see how well it relates to the film. The artwork on the backside if the cover was bad though. It looks like one of those cheesy eurotrash zombie films, and this film is a lot more than that!!! I am so happy this film has been ressurected. Brains, Brains, Brains!!!"
1,"The sound was great I like Harrison Ford in this film and I think it is considered one of his best films, specially I like the idea of the film, and the sound was amazing and effective and makes your heart pounding the whole film."
1,"Long lasting edging I purchased this edging when I moved into my new place in the late s. I wanted to edge my walkway to keep weeds off and to delineate my sidewalk in the winter for snow removal. I figured in would last a few years and crack during the winter when struck by a shovel,however, not one of the units has ever moved, lifted or cracked in over  years of sevice, winter or summer. I am extremely pleased. When I wanted to extend the edging I could not find this product so I bought another product that uses plastic nails to hold it and they all lifted in  years time, a bad decision. I am so glad Amazon has these units back again. Nothing else works."
1,"The Day The Earth Stood Still I first seen this movie when I was  years old, now I am  years old and I think the movie is still great. I now have it on dvd and I watch it a lot and I still love it."
1,"Taiko drum set Fun game for the family, even though I bought this game for my little nephewi played and enjoy this myself. So I would recommend this to any that is interestedin it. Buy it play it and enjoy it ."
1,"Great watch  again Love this watch. Easy to use, durable, stylish especially for the price. I had another Ironman watch that lasted about  years until the strap broke due to normal wear and tear from training sweat, salt, heat, chlorine, etc. I really like that the display is slightly bigger on this new one."
1,"Happy that I bought this game I too bought this game based on the single five star review. And I am very happy I did! This game is worth every single penny. This is a classic adventure game, with solid story line, well designed puzzles and great atmosphere. What people are expecting from an adventure game? Action? Violence? Speed? Well, this game has none of this and I am glad it doesnt. I enjoyed this game with all my family, we had several hours of entertainment, we learned about history and legends of Anacapri, with a lot of high quality pictures. It is not true there are no animations! All the ocean scenes are animated and theyre absolutely stunning. All the animals are well animated and there are plenty of atmospheric effects. I did play developers previous game which I found a step below. So overall, we had great time with this game and I recommend it to anyone who wants to have a serene yet intelligent gaming experience."
1,"Garmin C Street Pilot We are very happy with the Street Pilot. It has been all that we expected and more. Our only problem has been programing it to put us on major highways instead of back roads, but I think we may have solved that problem. We find it does a great job of getting you back on track when youve taken a wrong turn. We have even found streets in our area that we did not know existed. We are truly satisfied with this product."
1,Edible Ramen Let me start by saying that until now the only use I had for ramen noodles was possibly using them as packing material. I truly did not consider them food until now. I came into my kitchen following the smell of some really good oriental food cooking. When I entered the kitchen looking for the source of the delicious aroma I found my college age son munching on what appeared to be a instant noodle cup. Upon further investigation I found that the really good oriental flavor and aroma were coming out of that cup. Im hooked.
1,"Peter  Paul DVD This is a realistic hones rendering of the Book of Acts. The scenario, directions and production are superb. Watching this movie is not only a trip through the Book of Acts but also a cress cross the Whole New Testament Books which were written by St. Paul guided by the Holy Spirit."
1,"Fun game Wario has been in many video games, and this one is one of the best. It has great graphics, and is very fun. The negative part of the game is it only has  levels, with bosses, treasure, and heart halves to collect and defeat. My brother and I beat the game in exactly one week, although, my brother and I are very experienced game players. Its a short game, but it is a fun game. I think most kids would really enjoy this game.If the price is not too expensive, this is a good product from Nintendo."
1,"Just OK If you plan on being around any sand and wind, you will want something significantly more rugged. Some sand got into the mp compartment and we have a hard time opening and shutting it. Weve sprayed it with that air duster but its a stop gap measure. Also the handle that holds it up isnt that wide or sturdy, so if youre on a boat, you often have to grab the dock and make sure it wont tip over. The sound is fine. The battery life is fine. It just hasnt blown me away the way that the Bushnell dock did. Unfortunately, that is now discontinued. Its a pretty decent dock for the price."
1,"A great historical snapshot, and a great read for any student of counterinsurgency. Galula is able to present his experiences in a manner which is both analytical and intellectual, while being enjoyable to read. The book sheds light on the specifics of the French pacification effort during their conflict in Algeria. Anyone studying counterinsurgency in general should read this book, as his approach cuts to the core of idea."
1,"My Bone is Bigger! !! This bone is huge! Literally bigger my forearm. My fullgrown German Shepard has a hard time carrying it around he actually drags it.When I was unwrapping the bone, it suffered a one foot drop onto concrete and a large chunk off the end broke off. Now, my dog has a bone and a portable bone chunk he can actually carry around.Personally this was a good thing, but it did leave lots of small bits and chunks. So I would take caution if you had a smaller dog that can choke on things easily."
1,"A chillout  downtempo classic This CD may have been released back in , but the music in it is truly timeless A combination of funky and jazzy instrumental downtempo songs featuring acoustic drums, synth strings, vibes, electric pianos, funky rhythm guitars and occasional vocals.The sounds on this CD may not be groundbreaking, electronically speaking, but the music is far from dated. More than  Years later, there are a lot of artists creating the same exact type of music featured on this CD. Good music never goes out of style!Sure, there has been a lot of quality material released by other artists after this album was released, but that doesnt diminish the originality and quality of the music on this album.If you like downtempo  chillout music, this CD will be a worthy addition to your collection!, not only you wont be dissapointed, you will probably purchase other CDs from Fila Brazillias catalog."
1,"My opinion The unit does what it is supposed to. However, it is hard to read the white print. There is not enough contrast for clarity.I have some navigation complaints as it is not too user friendly.Nice clarity and reproduction.Lee"
1,"Its Mario!!!! My faith in the Wii has been restored!!!My Xbox  has held my attention away from my Wii for quite a long time now, but the time has finally come to go back to the Wii. Since the day Super Mario Galaxy came out, I have not touched my Xbox .Simply put Super Mario Galaxy is AWESOME! It goes back to the good old days of Mario. I am around a  of the way through the game and severely addicted! It brings in aspects of a lot of the older games into this new inventive world. The thing I like most is that they didnt over use the Wiimote functionality like they do in most of the Wii games.This is a solid addition to the Mario gaming line and a must buy for Mario fans or someone with a Wii that hasnt turned it on it months."
1,Half Helmets  Motorcycle Half Helmet DOT  Leather Great helmet and great price. The only trouble with leather is you dont want to drop it in gravel. It will cut up the leather but I am well satisfied with it. It looks great!!
1,"Sure Beats out the Compressor Models Quiet, hardly know its running unless sitting right beside it. Its in my kitchen beside the table. No vibration at all, which is very important for storing wines long term. Easy on the electric meter as well. Wish the shelves were a little further apart, but then that would reduce the amount of vino that you could store. Get one, you wont be sorry."
1,"Very Good but...... All of Laurien Berensons Melanie Travis mysteries are entertaining and Ive read most of them. My only objection is that Melanie Travis begins to wear on your nerves because she is so obstinate about EVERYTHING. There isnt just a few things she is hard headed about but everytime she comes up against something, she braces her feet. She is stubborn about her dog, her son, her job, her ex, Sam, her aunts and the list goes on. This becomes not only predictable but very boring. Melanie needs to become somewhat flexible and leave some of the pig headedness behind to make these books not only entertaining but more believable. Ms Berenson does an excellent job of transporting you to the dog show world, its just that sometimes I wish shed leave Melanie at home to grow up!"
1,"Excellent. This kit was a real saver during our painting projects. I used it while cutting in and making the borders between the ceiling and the walls. It does a really good job and i especially appreciate it since i had to do it while sitting high on the ladder under very high ceilings. The tray is a bit clumsy, but it was able to hold a roller, a  brush, some compound and a spatula. While being on  height i admired the coverage and ability to have everything i needed with me on a little tray. I was trying to buy the replacement cover  the same quality was . a piece. Ive just ordered another kit."
1,"nice gun this is a really nice gun. performed flawlessly all day. light, but with a solid feel. worked side by side with a makita all day and never missed a beat it actually totally outclassed the makita sorry makita but its true. the rafter hook and select fire are a necessity once youve had them. the only con was the reload indicator stops you with about  sinkers left and thats  nail too many to be able to drop  more strips in. that could get annoying but maybe its adjustable, ill have to check. either way i would not hesitate to buy another."
1,"This book is a vey descriptive novel... I am a young lady and when I was younger I didnt really like poetry and never got into it. But recently I bought J.W Bradfords Voices of the Heart and I really enjoyed the book.as I was reading it I could literally visulaize what he was saying in his poems. His poems give you the inside view of his life and the things that he has gone through. His daughters poems really touched my heart because I could relate with her about her mother but a little different, I didnt have a Dad growing up.when I read her poems I let a little tear down my face and realizing that nobody is perfect and alot of people are the same. In summary I really loved this book and I am going to recomend it to all my family to take a look at it. thank you for taking your time to read this.JESSICA PHILLIPS"
1,"Amazing! This is one movie that truly is great for small kids and adults! Ths story is fresh and original, the special effects are superb and the script is beautiful and the lessons taught are valuable. This teaches the importance of good manners, tolerance and imagination. Ive seen this movie with my  year old like  times and I still love it."
1,"Praise from a female fan Since all the glowing reviews were written by males and the most scathing review of Lance, not the book itself was written by a female, I thought Id weigh in to encourage women to read this book as well. As a cyclist and huge Tour de France fan, I too was expecting another rehash of previous Lance books. Instead, I was treated to the most compelling, enjoyable sportswriting Ive read since Stephen Kings essay on Little League baseball. Coyle paints such vivid mental pictures that you can almost hear the roar of the crowd lining the roads of France. You will also be treated to a behind the scenes look at everything in Lances life from his CrackBerry to Sheryl Crow. I laughed, I cried, I couldnt put this book down. A must read for the legions of yellow braceletwearing, faux cycling fans."
1,"Interesting Journey I love the premise of Wickers book because I can relate to it. She also observes without judgement and incorporates humor without poking fun, which is refreshing. Its an interesting commentary on a often misunderstood topic."
1,"Magical and mesmerizing What an amazing book. I found myself torn whether to linger over particular panels or rush on to find out what happened next. Katchor clearly inhabited the archive for a long time before putting this together, and he really captures the beauty, strangeness, and confusion of Jewish life in the early republic. Complex and funny storyline, often surpisingly moving. And although the drawing style is a bit crude, the design is always subtle  the overall effect only adds to the weirdness. Just brilliant, brilliant work."
1,"Excellent online tools  good conversational content The publisher includes excellent online tools, mainly listening. The content is conversationallyfocused. Note that this edition ISBN includes some teachers tools in the back."
1,"Put her on mute and crank up your IPod! Great workout! Really gets you sweating and your heart rate going. If you have tile or hard wood floors, I really recommend buying a mat for the ab cycle. Im excited to try more of her videos!"
1,"One of my all time favorites. I understand very little Spanish, but this album has become one of my all time favorites. I have to stop myself from listening to it too much. This girl has a fantastic voice."
1,Helpful Really helped me organize my workplace. I would recommend this book as an ideal organization companion. The methods presented in this book can certainly help someone in the business of knowledge work get organized.
1,"A heart warming story A sailor, whose papers are missing is forced to stay in the area, falls for a hooker with a street wise kid, and falls for both. The subsequent story of love, frustration, and questioning of feasibility for change make this Cinderella movie a heart warming, message bearing,feel good story. Excellent portrayals by Marsha Mason and James Caan."
1,unavoidable I got this DVD to evaluate if it had any redeeming information. The material is taken from documented public sources and from Obamas own publications. It delves into an explanation to understand Obamas obvious actions. It provides an objective and unbiased view of the Presidents perspective just as so many other publications have done for previous presidents. I would recommend this to any American who would like to grasp Obamas motivations.
1,"A Great Gloss To call this an omnibus would not be inaccurate its an allyoucaneat smorgasbord of Ellison. Good breadth of his sturdy career represented here and at roughly  pages, enough depth to keep a bibliophile busy for a while."
1,"Wellwritten, wellorganized howto The first thing I noticed about this book is the logical organization. It starts out with basic CVS functions and uses, then progresses to more advanced tasks and configurations. It is clear and concise, and so wellorganized its easy to look up specific tasks without having to wade through gobs of irrelevant verbiage. It includes many common pitfalls, and what to do about them. It covers logging, scripting, security, local and remote access this is the best reference for CVS. I recommend it highly all users, beginners to intermediate especially."
1,Willow Tree I collect the Willow Tree figures. My husband surprised me and bought me this and a few more for Christmas! I was thrilled . The Willow Tree are inspiring and will go with any decor color scheme.
1,"Slightly difficult to read but worth the time As Packer says in the Foreword, The present treatise is vintage Owen, searching and spiritual, devotional and doxological, the product of a masterful mind and a humble heart.It does not read like a novel, but it is worth the time to read Owens material on Biblical theology.Note Biblical Theology is that which starts with Genesis and builds teachings based only on what the particular writers have to say about a topic, building the theme together as one progresses through Scripture. Systematic Theology is that which takes a topic i.e., the atonement and finds all applicable texts from all over Scripture to form a concise teaching of that doctrine.Owens book is a Biblical theology. He begins with the Garden and progresses through the whole of Scripture developing themes and teachings as he takes the reader through.Difficult but very insightful!"
1,"One of Binchys Classics This was the first book I read by Maeve Binchy and this is what got me hooked on her writing! I fell in love with her style in The Glass Lake.The main character, Kit McMahon, rather than hurt her dad, chooses to burn an unopened letter from her mom the night of her disappearance.The rest of the book describes how life trudges on for the McMahons and Kits guilt over burning of the letter becomes a central focus for Binchy to elaborate upon. In the end, Kit comes to peace with her mothers final departure.Binchys novels are peaceful reads which focus on everyday trials predominantly set in Ireland with religion being in the midst of the turmoil.Catherine Jean SchoenbauerHumphrey, author of When the Smoke Clears How to Survive and Be Better Off With or Without Your Cheating Spouse"
1,I loved it i loves the book From the Mountain Top because i have writin in it. It is a poetry book and published one of my poems in it and other people have writin in it and i loves it. i cant wait to by the book.
1,"Cheaper at the grocery store!! I love these cookies, they are very good. I saw them in the international food isle and had to get them.. btw they are totally  cents at my grocery store for the exact same thing youre getting on here and I live in NC.. so Im so glad I didnt have to buy them online. They are best dunked in your hot tea or coffee if youre looking for a stronger flavor."
1,"A masterpiece given due, regal trappings by Criterion A monumental work  the definitive film on the creative impulse and the consequential search for perfection masterfully framed as the story of a th century monk. From its haunting, seemingly incongrous beginning think of it as a visual overture, synopsising the films themes much like an operas overture does for its musical motifs to its devastating ending, Rublev is awe inspiring in its depth, scope, and artistry. A sometimes difficult film whose rewards go beyond todays most extravagant expectations out of film. Its imagery and final claim haunt me, informing my thoughts and responses."
1,Up close and personal Ive known Mr. Herrin since  when he came to work for me soon after his release from prison. Hes been very open about his past and recommends this book as the main resource about the crime. I finally got around to reading the book and its fantastic. The book is fascinating as is Richards life.
1,Helpful Book Ive read and used portions of the rd edition. Some of the rd edition is a bit outdated so Im hoping the th will be up to date. Good armchair read that can actually get you out of some sticky situations. The guy has obviously been there and his descriptions match parts of the world that Ive had the displeasure to see.
1,"My first Inspector Barnaby mystery I enjoy British mysteries that come in a series so I can binge if I like the first one. I try not to choose a promising looking mystery until there are sequels already in print. Previously, I ran through Jacqueline Winspears  Maisie Dobbs books, Charles Todds Inspector Rutledge novels, Anne Perrys William Monk series, etc. Grahams Barnaby novels looked like a great new source of enjoymennt.I like Barnaby and hope Amazon has the rest of the books that have been published so far. I hope that more of Barnabys personality is revealed and the relationship with his sidekick is developed. Maisie Dobbs has Billy, Rutledge has Hamish, and Monk found Hester."
1,Spiritual Midwifery This is a wonderful book that encouraged my passion for home birth. Ive owned and loaned out  copies of this book. It was often kept out on the coffee table and I found that anyone that picked it up couldnt put it back down. I highly recommend this book for anyone considering home birth or anyone interested in becoming a midwife or doula.
1,"Though the pedestrian may reject it, Pedals shines. Complex, mellow and fullbodied are three words I would use to define wine. Delicious, supercilious and perfection are three words I would use to describe Pedals.  may be the best A.G. song ever. RRoses is a dynamite opener and the rich textures between complete the novel. This is not a release for the weak of mind, its a CD to slowly inhale and release."
1,"FanMaker Will Win Fans Ducornet is an excellent writer, and this book is clear proof that shes one well have to watch for in coming years. What distinguishes this from the pack is her clear grasp of De Sades thinking, and an amazing knack of making a pastiche of his style. The parts told in his voice really do sound like him. The fanmaker herself is a less welldefined character, but you find yourself believing her feisty responses to the dullwitted Revolutionary tribunal. All the prejudices, pretensions and illogicalities of the French Revolution are paraded in this short, but remarkably wellconstructed book. The fanmaker, her lover and De Sade represent freedom, while the parallels between the Revolution and the Inquisitions behavior in Central America are clearly drawn, in splendidly gory fashion. Not for the timid or puritanical, but you wont read a betterwritten historical novel this year."
1,Pretty Good Laptop This is a great computer for anyone and everyone. The only setbacks I found were  The Laptop doesnt have enough memory RAM. This can easily remedied by buying two gigs of RAM. It plays movies rather choppy.This is probably due to not having enough RAM.Other than that it is great!
1,"Chapman Family Bonded in Tropical WeddingInspiring The wedding special is beautifully done. Beths tropicalthemed wedding is set on the beautiful Big Island of Hawaii.

1,"Touching, heartfelt, encouraging..... Im am blessed to be Aidans Mother. One of the older preemies in the book. In fact this is one fo the things best about this book. It counts the feelings and fears of older preemie parents as valid too. From mirco preemie to just about term, the book offers the reader valuable insights into the road preemie new parents take. I have not read a better book on preemies. Since it is written in the parents voice, it is very comforting to read that others had the same emotions and fears as you did. The before and after pictures also give hope! This book is wonderful and I say that not as one of the contibutors but as a Mother of a preemie and a second low birth weight baby."
1,"Great Gift  Could Not Be Happier After trying the Keurig B coffee maker at a friends and raving about it, my dear husband surprised me with one just like it for Valentines Day. It has been months and I am in love with with KCup machine.I use to waste more coffee, and I never got the right consistency with my drip coffee makers. After spending loads of money on expensive coffees, and several coffee makers, I finally got one I LOVE.Coffee is hot hot hot which my drip maker could not matchThe variety is excellentIts so easy and quickPerfect coffee maker for me as I am the only one that drinks coffee at home.

1,"Excellent fitness gloves I do not recommend these gloves for serious boxers, they are safe for fitness purposes like light heavy bag work. They are fine for focus mitts and double end bags. The oz would be fine for sparring if you wrap your hands well.ProsTop notch quality  craftsmanship, they truly fit like a glove, the lining is the nicest out of the  different brands of gloves Ive owned. The leather  the color of the yellow,  white gloves are the sharpest looking Ive seen.ConsWeak wrist support, this is why I do not recommend them for serious heavy bag workouts,  full contact sparring. They have a very short cuff this is why they should be considered fitness gloves.These are excellent gloves at a great price."

1,"Decent product It is a good product. The only fault I can find is when using the smoker with the vent closed for like ribs, so much condensation builds up in the smoker that any wood biscuit left in the cooker at the end of the cooking falls apart and cloggs the feeder."
1,still loves to watch My two sons are now  and  but when these dvds were on videotape they loved them. They have every one and they still have all the VCR tapes.My boys will once in a while pop one of these tapes in the VCR and they still enjoy watching it at their age. I also like the shows. They were so funny. I am now purchasing the dvds for a nephew and for a friends  year old. Hope they have as much fun wathching as my boys did.
1,Excellent Can Crusher This is my second can crusher and an improvement over the first. My first lasted over  years but did little or nothing with bigger cans and didnt crush the typical soda can as small as this one but it was good enough. This can crusher is much better and reduces aluminum cans to an inch as advertised. I make a small indent using minimal pressure into the can. That makes it even easier to crush the cans and will probably make the crusher last longer.
1,"Its no Enron Smartest Guys in the Room... This doc follows a political career over its arc. Thats fascinating right now, but in  years this doc might be utterly forgotten. Thats because a political career is not a character. Or at least it wasnt in this doc.Enron did a much better job of tracking the rising hubris and avarice of characters and weaving a compelling story from that.This doc did do a good job of noting the extent to which politics is both petty and owned by big business  without unduly underscoring it or hitting the audience over the head with it.Anyway, its a letdown after expecting another Enron, but its still better than  of the docs out there. At least these guys know the basics of documentary filmmaking, which apparently was written in a single book that got lost in the last decade."
1,"Wondering Minds!!!!!! I truly appreciate the experience I shared in reading this book. I felt engaged to it form the first down to the last chapter. Mr. Hill has a way with words. I feel there were some underline sexist approaches through out the book, but still never the less a great book. I saw that Love can and will be blinding to those who dont want to open their eyes to reality. I am glad Maurice mad the decision he mad, but upset with Omenita. I believed in her potential in growing from her past, and desired her to think differently of her surroundings. A key point that was made early on in the novel that we all should take heed to, was never let who you came from nor what people think of you control your destiny. As an individual you decide what you will endure so choose what is meant for you instead of anothers burdens. I am a proud fan of Mr. Hills novels and anticipating upcoming readings."
1,razors edge Great Fox movie with an overwhelming cast. Maugham does a Herman Hesse thing that certainly moved types toward nonconformity. Im certain this flick had a lasting impression on Jack Kerouac. He must have seen it while at Columbia University. The beat era had its roots with this film. Clifton Webbs portrayal of uncle Elliot a gem. The song Mamoselle has a lasting effect on the production.
1,"Rachel multitasks! More fine, quick recipes from one of my favorite cooks. Rachel knows how to reduce a recipe to its basics without compromising the taste. On the day it arrived, we found a recipe that had to be shared  the Chili Casserole. I look forward to trying most of the others. I go back to Rachel Rays cookbooks time and again  many of her recipes have become standards in my cooking. But she can sure multitask! I rarely do one up in thirty minutes until I have done it several times."
1,"tons of info, but very strict diet This book was written by knowledgable and caring authors and has tons of info, but the diet is so strict, i dont think I could follow it very well. Also the authors ban many foods just because they are common allergens. And they dont always specify why a food is being banned, whether because it encourages candida or if it is an allergen. If you have candida and lots of allergies, follow this books diet. If you arent an allergic person try a book such as Back to Health by Remington  Higa. Because this book doesnt have Candida or yeast in the title, many sufferers will miss it when doing searches. The Back to Health book has a liveable diet and it helped me years ago with my candida and I am about to do this program again."
1,"Making punctuation fun No, its not an authoritative style book, though it does set out some well thoughtout guidelines on punctuation. And no, its not a comprehensive grammar text. Syntax mavins arent likely to learn anything new. It is, however, a delightfully witty, highly readable survey of a traditionally deadly dull subject. Heres a fun, brief analysis that is certain to be informative and useful to the average reader and writer. If you think apostrophes and commas are nothing to laugh about, youre in for a surprise."
1,"The BEST Introductory Textbook In Biochemistry... This text in Biochemistry is a great introduction. I was quite familiar with Lubert Stryers masterpiece but I must confess this textbook goes one step further. The slant is towards the med student and the notes on medical aspects are just plain fantastic. It took me almost a year to finish the book but the effort was well worth it. Besides I have been out of touch with Biochem since my college days. Aspects of RNA metabolism are plain fantastic!! What is more the layout and sequence of topics is just right. I found that using this text in conjunction with Basic Medical Biochemistry by Marks, Marks, and Smith will give you the best mix. Dont pass on this gem. It truly is worth your time and perusal. The cost is steep but textbooks usually are. Grab it!!"
1,"A soulful delight If you are a fan of the Jacksons, youre not a true fan until you have this set. All four disc have songs that easily should have made number one on the charts. The remakes michael sang on these discs, puts the origials to shame. This collection shows why he is today The King of Pop and the Jackson Five are the best teen group ever. THIS IS A MUST CD COLLECTION"

1,Waiting for the best season yet to be on dvd! My daughter and I love The Middle. I am impatiently waiting for the dvd set because she wasnt able to watch this last season and I thought it was the best one yet. It just keeps getting better. I have bought the past  seasons for her and she is anxious to own the rd season. No dvd release date yet?!
1,"Finale and Beginning in one! Oh man, picked this up last week, stayed up till  in the morning to read it all, even the summary part in the back just for kicks. The book was sad and yet good all the same time, fitting for the end of this portion of Gaias story. So while Ive heard many people complain about this book sucking, I think they need to look at it more, see that it fits well with Gaia and her life. Anyway, onto Fearless FBI! Oh man, cant wait this should be good, Im hoping some old characters pop up, and we find out what happened to Gaias dad, because seemed like Francine sorta forgot he existed. And Ed, who doesnt want Ed to come back huh? Anyway, read the book!"
1,"Whispers In The Dark I placed an order of the DVD Whispers in the Dark from Iain Kay. Mr Kay was very prompt in answering my request and mailing my DVD out to me. I received the movie in just a couple of days in outstanding shape. Mr Kay went the extra yard in seeing I received my DVD and also did a followup via email to me to advise me of when he shipped it. I would recommend him to anyone that is looking for a special DVD and wants outstanding and prompt service.Roger ReavesHelendale, CA"
1,"Excellent. A must read for anyone serving on a nonprofit board This book was given to me as a guide while I was serving on the Board of the Federation of Exchange Accomodators. The book is wellwritten and easy to understand. The author conveys the ideas is a simple, straightforward manner. The writing style makes it easy to grasp the concepts. His ideas need to be instituted by all boards of nonprofits. This book should be required reading for all new and old board members alike."
1,"Every Sentence Counts I had to read this book more slowly than usual, because every single word and every sentence was packed with importance. I cant wait for my friends to read this book so we can discuss the symbolism. I will anxiously await the next book by this author. I was late to work because of this book."
1,"A remarkable insight on the Middle East and its people I am glad Queen Noor wrote this book and shared with others her unique experience. Ive always admired her work but now I admire her even more as a person. The inside stories on the Middle East politics, the ArabIsraeli conflict and the United States governments lessthancommendable role in the region were told truthfully and candidly. This book also provides details of King Hussiens struggle to bring peace to the region. King Hussein and her also struggled to raise a family amidst all the turmoil in the region. Their genuine love for each other has helped them through a multitude of crises. This book is truly an eyeopener and I would recommend it to anybody!"
1,I love this walker!!! My husband and I bought this walker for our daughters first birthday because we have tile through our entire house and we are afraid that she will fall and hurt herself while trying to learn how to walk. She loves this walker!!! The tires are bigger than the other walkers so they do not get stuck in between the tiles like Spanish tile which was my biggest concern with other walkers. Now she can follow us around everywhere!!! I cannot understand why I didnt buy this a lot sooner!!!
1,"Heart Disease Review and Assessment I took my review and assessment in , when I was a resident of internal medicine and prepared for examination in Cardiovascular diseases. Id have problems to answering the questions, but the answers, sometimes quite detailed was very important to understanding the subject. Knowing the right answer is useless if you dont understand why its the right answer. The time propoused for each question  min and half wasnt enougth. I think that you will spend a lot of time to review this book. Take a special attention to part I in the examination of the patient, and if you have time look for the clinical cases."
1,"So far so good Switch has been online for a couple weeks and has not given me a problem. I rated  stars because the ethernet plugs are on one side and the power is on another. I knew this was the case before purchasing, so I should probably give it  stars, but you could buy another switch for a similar price point and get everything on one side."
1,"Out of the Ordinary Stargirl is a very unique book. It is about a girl named Stargirl, who is slightly different from everyone else. The author captures your attention by using a storyline that could actually happen. Stargirl moves to a new scool where she is shunned by her classmates because she doesnt act like everyone else. When she starts to like this one boy, eveyone starts to make fun of her even more. This is a good book and I strongly reccommend it."
1,New Possibilities Id always avoided studying feng shui because I felt that it was too complicated. This book carefully explains the basic concepts in ways that made it a lot less intimidating. Reading this book opened my mind to new possibilities about arranging my home so that I can better realize my personal and spiritual potential.
1,The CD is worth its price if you only love one song  I enjoyed this CD. The only reason that it is not my favorite is because it does not contain many of my old favorites.It does contain Soul Heaven and that is a hit!
1,"Admiralty in a Nutshell This is a wonderful book that makes good reading for Mariners of all ages who have an intrest in AdmiraltyMaritime Law. So,if you are about to pull some gold out of an abandoned shipwreck you better read the chapter on Salvage."
1,"Superb short stories This is short story writing at its best witty, intelligent, very well constructed and with unexpected, puzzling endings. The language is superb, with different styles, jargons and flavours.Brilliant and very amusing observations of social fads and phenomena, not necessarily Irish only.In my opinion instant classic."
1,Must read The third one of the best series I have read in a vey long time. The people and places drew you in and made you feel as if you were part of the village and one of the residents. A gifted author that I thank our Father for her talent.
1,"Explore the City Each time I movve through the City I find new things. Also, you can move through the levels along different paths each time that you play the game. And, you can change the order in which you play.Thief  has an amazing complexity."
1,"Inspirational This book is another of Lauraine Snellings wonderful, inspirational and heartwarming pioneer stories. It gives you a helpful encouragement to follow the examples of her characters, which remind me of my own pioneer ancestors. Maybe I should also write stories about my own, since she does such a good job with hers."
1,Sensational. I enjoyed this book a lot. It was difficult for me to put it down at times. The end of the book leaves you captivated. It makes you want to start the next book in the series as soon as possible.
1,"WYNONNA  GREAT SOULFUL SINGER!!! In concert, Wynonna is a stunning soulful singer with no limitations!! Finally this broad scope is happening in the recording studio and all the better for us fans!! Wynonna is a classic voice who sings with a great deal of passion and a mustsee concert experience that I have had the pleasure of experiencing numerous times and this is the real deal!! Originally this collection was going to be a really broad departure for Wynonna but scaled back to include old country feelingsstill a step forward!!

1,"Two units dont work I bought one of these units since I cant see our driveway from the house, and it worked beautifully, so much so that I decided to buy one for the back of the house, but discovered that they are on the same frequency. Now when something sets off the front driveway, the back receiver goes off too, and vice versa, so I have no idea which side of the house someone is approaching. I checked,by taking the unit apart and there is no way to change frequencies on the the units.Anybody know a work around for this situation?"
1,"Great!!! But...  games for around .. not bad. All the pro pinball games are great with very good physiscs. The tables are so close to the real thing that it includes an operators mode where you can change options, ect...Theres been talk about gamefest not including the music for timeshock and the web. Thats a bunch of BS. Apparantly, its a bug thats causing no music to be heard, which apears when you run the game the first time, after that, you should hear music.One way you can confirm this is by puting this disc in your cd player and skip to track .It lost one star because Big race usa and Fantasic J. runs slow when more than  balls are in play. Even though Im using a powerful system. And even when I patched it. Very dissapointing.But in timeshock you can have up to  balls and no lag even at      or Even with those minor problems, this package is a must have."
1,"A Frank Look at a Fascinating Life Janet Langhart Cohens book is illuminating both for its commentary about American society and its changes, as well as her reflections upon her life and circumstances surrounding that life. I was enormously impressed by her work with the military and their families when her husband was Secretary of Defense. She has taken all times of her life, both good and bad, learned from them and made the best of life. Shes an impressive person, with depth and compassion."

1,"Oldschool. This is one of those animes that cant be judged by todays standards. The first was released in , and to appreciate it youve got to pull yourself away from all the Love HinaTenchicute robot girl and overly dramatic series like Naruto. While it isnt the best out there, its a good piece to own if you grew up on anime from this era. Gritty and gorey.So, when youre watching this, forget the year  or so date that this package has and remember that it is in fact from ."
1,"Fun And Entertaining This book has suspense, intrigue and more twists than Lombard Street in San Francisco. Harvey Mapes is a security guard at a wealthy apartment complex,low man on a low totem pole. His only excitement is watching Cop shows and reading detective novels. He fantasizes the exciting life of a PI. In almost Wizard Of Oz fashion, a tennant decides to have Harvey trail his wife to which he finds out that their is an added dimension to the tradepain."
1,"Dont know about the ending, but still a sweet trilogy! I feel that if you have seen the movies and cant wait for the next Trilogy then you have to revert to reading some books. Well these are about as close as you are going to get to the original characters and action without actually watching the movies. Good story, clever settings. The only complaint would have to be the ending, but its still ok.  J.A.S."
1,"Good in a home, Not in a zoo. We have this lamp and love it, its stylish, but really lights up an entire living space unlike other lamps that seem to only light up their little corner of the room. The lamp heads are all adjustable and can be positioned to light up every corner of a room. The only problem as others have suggested is the stand is relatively flimsy where it attaches. Its not sturdy, or thick, and so its easily broken. Our  yr old thought it would be fun to stand on the base and lean back holding the pole, so it snapped. We quickly went out and purchased an identical lamp placing it behind a heavy piece of furnitre so it wouldnt be messed with and its lasted and worked wonderfully.Id recommend purchasing the lamp, but make sure when youre handling or moving it that you be gentle, and dont keep it in an open space with young kids."
1,Wonderful gift This device is absolutely wonderful for the bookworm. Easy operation and visual in every way. Bought for my wife and it definitely added to the love savings bank. Purchased with leather cover. Very classy.
1,"Comparison with the Sony dectaphones I know that Panasonic microcassette recorders are the most widely used recorders especially in the middle east, by physicians,but when i compare its usage with the Sony microcassette recorders,i am more comfortable using the Sony, because it is lighter and the pause button is easier to use."
1,"Correcting Ignorance I am an architecture student at Washington University. This book is a great stepping stone into Architectural Theory. But, why I am really writing this review is to correct the unreadindividual who wrote a review of this book prior to me.phenomenology  noun. A philosophy or method of inquiry based on the premise that reality consists of objects and events as they are perceived or understood in human consciousness and not of anything independent of human consciousness.. A movement based on this, originated about  by Edmund Husserl."
1,"Listen to No One...Ignorance is Bliss If you are reading this, you probably know Miikes work and this of no use to you. To those who happen to stumble on this review, DONT look for reviews. DONT look for plot synopsis. JUST WATCH. Take all the wonderful things of movies about finding love and horror, and watch it all come down. Miike knows this...and loves it. You know this...and thats why you watch."
1,"Attention to Detail Stephenson loves details, and this book is full of em. Every single thing in this book, from the pizza deliveries to the metaverse to the orign of a deadly virus, everything in this book is detailed to perfection. Stephensons description of his postmodern world is truly quite amazing.The characters are also quite great, but perhaps not as detailed as the environments themselves. The relationship between Hiro Protagonist the coolest character name ever, btw and Y.T. is never really explained, and you sometimes wonder why they even help each other out. Their whole relationship seems to be not based on of loyalty or much less friendship, but one of being there at the same time. Theyre never aware what the other one is up to until they run into each other. But it actually makes for a few laughs and unpredictability.You cant go wrong with Snow Crash. Its an easy read, entertaining and even informative. Youll be wanting to read it again right after you finish it."
1,"Nice but a little bunchy at the bottom... Very fast shipping! Great price! This petticoat got the job done for my sub ball dress. However, same as some of the other reviews, after hanging this thing up for  weeks in my bathroom before use hoping the steam from the shower would help even things out it still seemed much more bunchy at the bottom which made my dress look lumpy  It wasnt HORRIFIC but I would have liked to have gotten a smoother finish"
1,"Good, but wish Large was REALLY LARGE When I buy rawhide bones for my  year old  lb Yellow Lab who has more energy than all of my prior  dogs put together as well as my  lb Leonberger Google them, great breed, I need LARGE bones. This is purely to protect my investment in furniture you understand.  long is a snack to them. These bones must be the filet mignon of bones. I have tried store brands You know whose I mean! and they last longer, but I am not saying that is a good sign. The dogs just dont seem interested in them. They lay around getting dusty and nasty. Really, my only issue with these is they are  and I wish I could get a value pack of  bones of this type. My big kids could really enjoy them longer. The price is very reasonable compared to what I pay in the pet superstores."
1,"Brilliant depressofunkpop This cd is the perfect rainy day companion beats drip and tap and pound, like rain on a tin roof... the songs are like clouds with just a hint of sun creeping around the edges...and the vocals are like that catch in your throat when you mean to say how you really feel but then cant. This is pure pop and the best kind of indie, never a dull moment, and the artwork is really cool, too. Try it, youll fall in love!"
1,"Fantastic Fowl Truly the best book I have read for entertainment value. It will appeal to adults even more than children because of its subtle writing. Artemis is a very complex little boy who is taking on adult responsibilities and doing very well. He uses his natural intelligence and hard, hard work studying the computer to regain the family fortunes. He wants us to think he is a tough, macho man, but his endearing childishness and true goodness and morality show through many times. He doesnt want to appear a wimp so he tries to disguise his goodness. If readers cant see through this, thats too bad for them. The actual writing is spare and appropriate. There is no horrible overwriting and reapeating and padding like in the last Harry Potter and I wouldnt compare it to that book at all. Read and enjoy for the wit, writing, excitement and excellent characters. This is from a highschool teacher who should know."
1,"Very Useful list of creative names My wife and I were really struggling trying to give our dog good name that would also be a little creative. A variety of lists on web pages didnt do the trick. Ten minutes with this book and we had our name Lira. We also came up with several other really good ones I would have never thought of otherwise. If you want to name your dog something other than Max or Maggie though those are good names, give this book a try."
1,"Incredibly beautiful! Desiderata, Words for Life by Max Ehrmann with photographs by Marc Tauss is gorgeous. It is filled with thought provoking words and dreamy, lush photos. Desiderata is beautifully designed with lovely, richly toned photos and simple, elegant typography. Desiderata offers quite a mental escape for one during rough times. Its a perfect book for many different occasions graduations, birthdays, promotions, etc. I highly recommend it for people of all ages."

1,"A Good Informative Read What Looks like Crazy was a good read. It really opens your eyes to the issues that one must deal with while living with HIV. Its not preachy, but yet sends across a message about many other things such as love, abuse, alcoholism, drugs, and violence. Ava is the main character who is HIV positive, and she is the narrator of the story. You cant help but empathize with this character. Joyce, her older sister, is just as enjoyable. The love and support between these two sisters is astounding. Their relationship epitomizes how sisters should stick together. What I really liked about this story is that the author leaves the message that love is always possible, not matter what the circumstances are. This is my first read by Pearl Cleage, and I plan to read the sequel, I Wish I Had a Red Dress, which tells the story of Joyce."
1,Thunder Cake A Grandma and little girl were together. There was about to be a thunder storm and the little girl was afraid of thunder. Together they made a thunder cake. If they didnt finish in time it wouldnt be a real thunder cake. I recommend this book to st graders. Joy G.
1,"Do you want to be challenged? I was amazed with the story of the servant of Abraham. Throughout the pages of God Moments in Time, I was challenged by the actions of the servant. I have read Genesis  several times but I was amazed at the details of this story when you truly take time to look at them. Mr. Brewer will not only make you think about the details of this story but at the same time challenge you to live a life where you too can experience God Moments in Time. I have just begun to think about the impact my life can have on future generations if I too will be faithful to the doors God opens in my life.If you are looking for a book that is challenging, motivating, and also easy to read, God Moments in Time is for you! Also the discussion questions for each chapter in the back of the book are a great bonus!! Theses questions are great for individual study and also would work great for small groups"
1,A book for serious athletes Finally someone has written a book about pilates that is not just for women. It makes perfect sense that the concentrated nature of pilates benefits athletes in terms of performance and injury prevention. I feel like my training and attitude has improved already. I cant recommend this book highly enough.
1,Dog loves it! Good quality.  Wheres the squirrel? If your dog loves to tug and gets excited when you say squirrel then this is a great toy. My dog lbs loves to tug. We used to have a squirrel that looked more like a sock. That got old and stanky and it was time for a new one. This one looked interesting since it can FLY! And it has handles rope to help with tugging grip. We gave it a try and love it! Great quality for some excellent tug time. And the squeekers two  one in tummy and one in tail make for the added satisfaction of a squirrel in pain poor squirrel. Happy tugging!
1,"An excellent album, sadly unnoticed Its strange, and quite sad, that Chris Darrow, one of the most original US artists, had to find a record label in Germany to keep on recording. A founding member of Kaleidoscope, he was also part of the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band in the late s and worked with Linda Ronstadt, surf championsinger Corky Carroll, Kim Fowley and many other rock, folk and surf groups. CoyoteStraight from the heart is a superb double album, with one haunting instrumental CD, full of desert winds emotions, and the other containing several excellent and touching songs, very moving at times."

1,"Where is Sunny Side of the street? I was glad to get the soundtrack, but was sooo disappointed when Bunny Briggs solo was left off the CD. That cut was one of the reasons I purchased the CD! To me, Sunny side of the street is almost a theme for the movie, sung by someone IN the movie. Beside that, I loved it!"
1,"Great business book about a true legend I had read Monica Langleys excellent book Tearing Down the Walls on Sandy Weill and when I saw this I knew I had to read it too. Since it was a business autobiography, which tend to be poorly written I didnt except much. I was suprised, this book is very well written and a true page turner that I simply could not put down  I finished it in a week.Sandy Weill is the real deal, he reshaped the financial services industry forever. Of particular interest is how he had a falling out with Peter Cohen, Jamie Dimon and later John Reid. It is a shame that like Hank Greenberg, a true legends career had to end under the ruthless selfpromoting Elliot Spitzer and sad to read the toll it took on Sandy but like almost all else he has overcome everything and his legacy is one of greatness."
1,"Best so far... I have to say reading the reviews and seing that noone bothers to mention The Hook Up best second song in the album, i think its sounds kinda like a jamaican vibed its is realy good. The best one is Toxic the beat the lyrics everything is good, all the other song are very good too exept those that are techno related. In all its a good album and her best so far, nice one."
1,"Supporters of cutters should read this book! I read this book because a good friend of mine has been cutting herself, and I was hoping to gain an understanding of what was driving her to do such a to my mind bizarre thing, and what if anything I could do to help. This book is great both for cutters and for those close to them, as it speaks to both. Most importantly, my friend read it too, and it has helped us have a good dialogue about the book and about her situation. If you read this book and keep in mind Levenkrons advice when you are interacting with a cutter, you might help that person to feel more comfortable with you and other people, thereby alleviating some of her isolation and desire to cut."
1,"Great Guy Movie, okay dvd This is a solid . star movie. But the dvd is only  stars due to only dolby . sound and almost no extras.But it is a guys movie all the way, good fight scenes, explosions and splash of frontal nudity. This excelent movie is in the same sprit as Die Hard, Lethal Weapon, AlienS and Pale Rider.Surprisingly you can also watch this with women since they go gaga remembering DirtyDancing and Ghost which also stared Patrick Swayze.The only complaint I have is about the effort they put in producing this DVD. Happy that IT IS widescreen but upset at the plainess of the DVD almost no options or extras. I would have loved to see a featureette of Swayze being trained by Benny The Jet Urquidez who also makes a cameo appearance. And what is up with only dolby ....Jeez does no justice to the fine soundtrack created by Jeff Healy."
1,"Just loved it I saw this on tv along time ago, and loved it. Out of all the movies Ive seen on jesus, this was the least hollywood. It has a very realistic feel to it ,as if that was really how it was back then. I would have given it  stars, but the scenes are a bit choppy because of where the commercials used to be."
1,"Its Star Wars......of course you need it! I have ALL Star Wars versions  of course Lucass later additions sucked, but once a Star Wars fan  always a Star Wars fan.The blu rays, as usual, are always about the aesthetics  stop thinking and just get it."
1,"Very well done Ive been to their show in both Chicago and New York, and thought this reflected the style and energy of the live performance, without making it a true soundtrack. I agree that it needs to be cranked up to be truly appreciated."
1,"Conflicting info in Product Review Section Why does the reading level under Product Details say ages , when reviews by School Library Journal and others say that this a book for toddlers and kindergarteners? Judging from the text, I cannot believe that an eightyearold would be interested in this book. Please be more thoughtful with your product descriptions."
1,"The Day Trader is The Right Stuff The Day Trader is a wonderful account of a day traders road to success. Mr. Borsellino is able to recap his victories on the trading floor by sharing the adversity that stood between him and his goals. The Day Trader is an entertaining must read book about the past, present and future of trading in the pits."
1,"AWESOME BOOK READ ALL OF THEM IN THE SERIES!! This book is fabulous! Every page is filled with suspense, making you not want the book to ever end! I have read most of the books in the series, and I reccomend all of them! I read this book in  days!"
1,"Good Machine You will most likely need  people to put this together. Or  mechanically inclined person. I did it alone but it was a struggle, I was too tired to use it when I was finished.It is a nice solid machine, with good programmable options, espically for the price. It is a little less smooth turning than Id like, so it has a little more of a walkingrunning feel than the expensive ellipticals you use at the gym, but the important part was to lessen the impact on the knees which this machine does effectively.For the price, it is a wellbuilt machine. I would reccommend it."
1,"The Culture of Spontaneity A Stunning Overview of the Avant Garde I wont push this too hard, but the five star rating is welldeserved. Belgrad writes in an easily digested, well thought out style that is both informative and palatable, even for the casual reader. Beat culture, the postwar Avante Garde artists, and many other subjects are covered here in extensive detail without becoming stale or tiresome. A very fast read for what amounts to, and pardon the term, an academic text. I highly recommend this to anyone curious about the arts during the postWorld War II era and the ss."
1,"delicious, healthy recipes I wanted to add a good review for this book because people have written negative things about it. The recipes are so good! I made several for different parties and everyone loved them. Theres lots of other info, but if youre not interested, dont read it! Yes, its true that the index is not thorough enough for a book thats organized differently like this one is, but thats the only drawback to this healthy cookbook."
1,"If I had three thumbs.... I would give this book a three thumbs up review! Quincunx is an incredible writing feat. I can see why it took the author  years to complete. He has captured the essence of Dickenslike characters by getting into their skins. One would think he actually lived in the era of the incredible cast of characters. I loved the way Palliser recapped throughout the book, using the characters to restate major events that had taken place many pages back. It isnt hard to get a bit turned around because of the many turns of events that take place. Just when the reader takes a deep breath of relief for the heroine and her son, something absolutely awful takes place and the roller coast ride is on.This is a pageturner that transports readers to notsojolly England."
1,"A great book about the greatest player Another Dover reprint! You know I rate Dover books highly. This one is top notch too, reaching their usual high standards for binding etc. The original print is retained which is good as the diagrams from the hardcover edition were excellent. For computer users they are the Hastings font  The translation to English was done by Heinrich Fraenkel Assiac and is excellent. The games are typical of Lasker  all fighting games  there are losses and all show his grim determination to win. But the best part is the biography. Lasker was a highly intelligent man, who only played chess out of necessity. We are treated to a description of his youth, his relationship with his brother, Berthold, who became a famous Doctor. But the real story is his romancing of Martha his wife. Great human interest, great chess, and we also get the crosstables for the events that Lasker played in. A must buy for all players no matter their strength."

1,"Hairspray This is the original movie that the show was based on. Divine is an actor that John Waters worked within all his early films. Ricki Lake, the original fat girl, is fantastic and of course very pretty."
1,"Spectacular This is one of the best books Ive read! Teens can actually relate to the situations portrayed. Speak certainly speaks to me.The basic premise of this story is that Melinda, is a loner. Her exfriends all hate her because she called the cops on a party. But they dont know what happened to her there...As Melinda goes through ninth grade an outcast, her only friend is her diary. She relates what happens in high school in a sarcastic manner.This story is a darkly funny drama that pokes fun at high school, but also causes you to think as well. A mustread!"
1,"Groundbreaking, nailbiting thriller M.R. Sellars does a variety of things with Harm None, not the least of which is scare the pants off the reader. But he also takes us into a world that many know nothing aboutat least the facts about contemporary witches and the Wiccan religion.Sellars has managed to educate, entertain and terrify all at the same time. I look forward to the next book."
1,"Phone Review I know people that have had this phone in the Upstate NY area and have had wonderful experiences with this phone and other Moto phones. As for the idiot who had either poor or NO service with Nextel and stayed for  years and did not cancel there contract and pay the  dollar cancellation fee, I wish I could sell them something. How foolish could someone be, paying for NO SERVICE"
1,"Good overview of many JFC components Overall I like this book because it shows quite a lot about many JFC components. Ive also found that a trick I read about for one component can be applied to another JFC component.I would be happier if some of the examples were larger. I realize this is hard to accomplish in a book, but Im still looking for something with good details about JTree and the tree model.The book doesnt cover Drag and Drop, Accessibility, or internationalization issues."

1,"A good friend This CD is a revolution of a new style of music. The gateway to bluegrass is here! As a matter of fact, you may notice that my name is Elijah OConnor  similar to Mark OConnor. That is actually because I am a rather close relative of his..........his son. I know each of them pretty well  Sam used to babysit me as a baby, and Edgar, when I was about , threw me into the air at a dinner party type deal and slammed my head into the ceiling! I dont quite know Bela as well, but Jerry is a really cool guy as well I recently ran into him at the August Down From the Mountain tour in San Diego, California.My dad is really neat as well! Please, I would recommend getting into his music  very enjoyable!"
1,"Terrific Dessert Book! I have always been cooking challenged in the kitchen. So when I tried making something from this book, I was sceptical. But the recipe turned out terrific! My date loved it, too, and couldnt believe I made it. I had to show him the book to prove it! I cant wait to try another recipe from this book. Maybe my inability to cook days are over!"
1,"Like Romeo And Juliet... Only Lots Bloodier... MEATBALL MACHINE is a tale about the trials and tribulations of young love. It is also a story about alien parasites that latch onto human hosts, drill out their eyeballs, and assimilate  mutate their organs, turning them into weapons of mass destruction. Our young lovers are caught up in this epic struggle between extraterrestrial warriors, bent on utterly destroying each other in the messiest ways conceivable! Will true love prevail, or shall the necroborgs inherit the earth? MM is a fantastic example of the triumph of imagination  ingenuity over budgetary limitations. The extra feature short films are cool as well. Highly recommended to the nonsqueamish..."
1,"Focus on Technology This show tells the story of DDay, with a strong emphasis on the development of new ideas and strategies for dealing with the problems caused by launching such a large invasion. For example the Germans installed many obstacles on the beach that would be hidden in the water at high tide. So what did the Allies do? Land at low tide!The stories behind some of the new technology are reviewed in depth the Higgins Boat, which was modified into a landing craft floating tanks, which would be launched at sea and hopefully would make it to the beach and lend vital support to the infantry and Percy Hobarts many innovations for overcoming obstacles on the beaches the flail tank, the Bobbin tank, and more. Also included in the program are interviews with several veterans of the battle, including one old soldier from Germany. They share their memories of that fateful day and give the viewer an idea of what it was like to be on the Normandy beaches on June , .Four stars!"
1,"Book of propheciess.... If you are into this type of material, you will enjoy this book. I use it as a refence when I have small parties at the house to have fun with my guests. I wouldnt take things too literal though."
1,"Beautiful, but clasp isnt as described The bracelet is lovely. The stones and weight are very good. However the bracelet I received didnt have a double safety clasp, as stated, and the clasp it does have has no safety feature and doesnt close well. I feel it will have to go back in the hopes of getting a replacement with the correct clasp. It is a very nice piece so hopefully I can get the safety clasp problem resolved."
1,"Promising Contribution I have read through the book, and noticed contributions by well known researchers in the field, including Rob Koper and Kinshuk.The main feature perhaps is that its organization is according to the cognitive focus areas which is novel and that these ideas are applied to various different domains including web searches, elearning, etc.Its weak point perhaps is the lack of strong connection between the chapters, but overall I felt it was a good buy."
1,"True Funk Nikka Costa is so heavily slept on, so underrated, so overlooked that its almost painful. The  release of Everybodys got their Somethin was CRAZY with two hot summer tracks that are still being played on movies and commercials to this DAY! Its funny that people still wont give her proper acknowledgment. Now, four years later I feel like I understand exactly where her spirit lies. I am truly blown away by Nikkas style, voice and tireless energy. Funkier than a Mosquitos Tweeter is a classic cover that Nikka performs with originality and pizazz. With Lenny Kravitz, ?uestlove, Justin Stanley and others like Wendy Melvoin kickin in, the vibe of cantneverdidnothin is catchy, fun and memorable. I love it, love it, love it. Till I Get To You, Around the World, Happy in the Morning I dont know where to stop. I love Nikka! Remember her name this is talent that should get more props."
1,"Great Teaching Resource The videos and music on this DVD are great for  year olds. They enjoy following the movements portrayed on the screen. The interface is a little difficult, but it is well worth the money."

1,"Enlightment Lloyd Ogilvie scores again with an insightful, intellectual, and uplifting explantion of the scriptures in languge understandable to the layman. Drawn from experiences during his many years as a leading, dynamic preacher, the vignettes present a credible account not only of the meaning of life, but also the meaning of living."
1,"Excellent! I just happened to find this book while I was reading Stephen Searss Gettysburg. The D map of the Gettysburg battlefield on the last page of this book helped me to understand the importance of terrain in this battle. Unlike the traditional paper map you find in most books about the war, in Freys book you can literally run your finger across the terrain and feel the high rise of Round Top and the low ground around the angle where Picketts Charge took place. This D map helps you to understand why Lee chose to attack that topographically shallow point of Cemetary Ridge. This book is invaluable. I wish Frey would do an entire book of these D maps of various Civil War battlefields. I also liked the other D displays as well. I recomend this book to everyone child and adult alike."
1,"A Fantastic Introduction to the Scientific Evidence I have now read this book and Where Reincarnation and Biology Intersect. I strongly recommend reading both volumes, but for a perfect overall introduction to Stevensons perspective, I am suggesting this volume to people. I loved it from beginning to end, and I deeply respected the mature approach to the data that the author maintained. He was bright, articulate, and he impressed me as having been completely sound in his integrity, competence, and judgement. Everyone should read this book!!"

1,"Absolutely Wonderful My husband and I both have this headset. It is absolutely wonderful especially if you have a blackberry. The reception is clear and though when you first see it you think its big, the  earpiece option provides a fit for everyone. And its the size that makes it stay on your ear and not feel like its about to fall off. Weve had it for over a year and it was worth the money thus far."
1,"A book to change your outlook! When I read this book, I could not put it down. It not only gave me a new outlook on the history of my country, but it also gave the Bible a new dimention to me. I had no idea about some of the things in my countries history, and every thing Dr. Grady writes here is backed by the authorized KJV! I recommend this book to every bible believing christian, and heathens alike!"
1,A must see for Troma Team fans!! I have seen this movie many times and I just love it. It is so silly and stupid that it really is enjoyable. I do not recommend this movie to people who want to see a scary or serious film. It a fun movie for those who love cult classics. A GREAT MOVIE!
1,First Bollywood movie I watched This was a very good movie. I wasnt sure if I would like it at first because its very long and a little cheesy... but once I got into the story and the characters I really enjoyed it. Its very comical and some of the songs are very entertaining.

I caught the good ole form virus, i lost hours of graphic work and months of intelectual property so i thought....be swooped in, took a gander at my fat partition and allowed me to copy all files to a nearby networked drive. Be is virtualy virus proof also. with minimal load times and companies such as Stienburg, Id. software, MetaCreations, and Sun to name only a portion in software production why not make this investment. This price is great for the book alone. do yourself a favor and at least visit their site"
1,"what a good way to find good mysteries and articles i happened to learn of The Strand from one of the PBS stations. it was given as reward for singing up. i have continued getting the magazine, it has so many features and book titles, i cant imagine what i did before i had The Strand to guide me. the presentation is great and i eagerly await the next issue. Thank you to the editor of the magazine.Christine Carparelli"
1,"Dont listen to it if u dont understand music This is by far the best album by Nirvana. Many people enjoy the more radio friendly songs but thats just because they dont understand music. The album goes from an upbeat beginning to a rather somber ending and can play with your emotions like no other Nirvana album. The guitar playing flows along with the moods as it goes from rather simple chords to a little more complex as the album progresses to its more angry side. Anyone who wants to here real music should listen to the last  songs or so on this album. Most people just dont understand how music works and dont get the pure ride of listening to the music. When u begin to understand music, then buy Incesticide. Otherwise, stick to the horribly awful music of the present."
1,"Black Thornes Rose I am a Susan King fan. I waited a long time to read this particular book as I could not find it at my local bookstore  once I found the author and her books. A very enjoyable read. Susan King lives up to her previous writings. Enjoyable read. An escape in time,a time to relax."
1,"Denali Outdoor Kit The tools appear to be identical to item number BAHG, this kit is exactly what they say it is. I needed a kit that I could use from time to time when camping or for around the home. I dont think the tools are meant to be used everyday but they are more than adequate for the occasional use. The axe is extremely sharp and the case is compact and tough. You will not cut a tree down with the pruning saw but I had no problem with small branches, the handle is very comfortable and the blade is very sharp. I was a bit leery about the shovel at first but after tightening it down nice and tight, it became pretty sturdy and easy to use. It is after all a folding shovel. A good set for the price."
1,"Emotionally vulnerable. Most people have preconceived notions of this album due to the decision to release Dirrty as the first single. Surely, most of those notions are negative. Stripped is not an album that should be defined by a sexedup video. It is much more than that. Christina has matured and had her say in what went onto the album this time. She expresses herself very eloquently on most of the album and she is emotionally vulnerable. One should respect the honesty of this album, with the exception of two or three songs that clearly do not belong on the same disc as the others. Im OK is a stand out track and, in my opinion, the best song on the cd. Overall, a great collection of songs. Now, if only Christina would dress accordingly."
1,"Predictability is boring Conformity is too. Tom Jenkinson, a.k.a. Squarepusher, has the innate ability to create music that sounds erratic and frenetic, yet comes together in the end. The result is the forming of complex streams of rhythm and sonic rhyme, expanding well beyond the genre of techno into which the music of Squarepusher is pigeonholed. Though anything but mainstream, Squarepusher and the release Hard Normal Daddy, appeals to all of my frinds who are willing to slightly diverge from the norm. The release Hard Normal Daddy provides the listener with all that is irresistably abstract about Squarepusher. This could range from interwoven primitive beats that seem to communicate more than simply play, to melodic grooves straight from the mother ship. Sounding more similar to Big Loada than Squarepushers Music is rotted one note or Budakhan Mindphone, Hard Normal Daddy proves to be an enduring, exciting, and rare type of recording in the realm of electronica."
1,"Knockout Karrin Allyson from my native Kansas City, Mo. just gets better as time goes on. Her latest CD, Footprints, is a knockout and deserves  stars out of . I am not a jazzaholic or an expert on technical music analysis, but as a jazz fan I am just blown away by Karrins new one  especially Strollin and A Tree and Me. And the guest artists are superb. Keep it up, Karrin. Everyone should have the thrill of listening to Footprints, a great addition to your already outstanding CD offerings."
1,Awesome game is great. It seems most reviews cover almost everything but heres something you might need to know before you buy it.You must patch game before you can play it in windows  or the compatibility assistant will block it. you may have issues playing in game cinematics game version .

1,"Just the Facts I have read this book. I am not a licenced councelor of any kind but I have counceled many people with problems that this book describes. Critics who try pathetically to descredit a book because they disagree theologically using arguments from silence and partially quoting scripture are not a valid citicisms. The real questions areHow many people are being helped?How many lives are being changed?These are the valid questions not does this agree with my view of God!Finally, if the question of Christianity is brought in the question is Is Jesus ChristGlorified and given ALL the credit for the work done.By the way the answers are Many, Many and Yes! So what is the problem?"
1,Snooooooooooooop! I bought this album a few months ago and I enjoyed most of the songs.. I skip some but most of them pass the smog test. I think that over the years snoops lyrics have become less agressive I guess you could say but I still enjoy what he does and I would definitly recommend this album.
1,"Craftsman Slow Charger  Volt   Well first of all, there was NO OPERATORS MANUAL with this charger. That said, I needed a charger because my original just gave up. It works great although I wondered what the yellow light is supposed to indicate. You plug it in the wall socket, put the battery in the slot, and it charges. What else do you need. But I still wonder what that yellow light is for. LOL"
1,"Succinct but in depth I thank you, Jon Kabat Zinn, for writing this book. I have been practicing Yoga for  years and teaching it for . Mine is an ongoing quest to understand my self. I practice the  limbs of Yoga on the mat and off it.The Yoga Sutras and the works of other Yoga masters guide me daily. Yet there have been times when I have needed something more to bring presence into my daily life.Wherever You Go There You Are has provided me with what I have been looking for. The works in this book help me see myself a little bit better, a little bit clearer. They provide direction on how to proceed when I feel stuck or confused. They also provide techniques and tools to overcome the bumps or challenges that I may be experiencing at any one moment.So, thank you so much for this insightful piece of work. You are a true guru. Thank you."
1,"Light, organic, and perfect to snack on... If you are into organic and light healthy snacks, I totally recommend all the Healthy Handfuls snack. Not as fattening as other snacks but a snack that will make you feel good and satisfy that craving for sugarsalt. Made for kids on the go but I think adults will enjoy this snack also. There are no hydrogenated oils, no GMOs, no preservatives and contain no trans fats. Healthy Handfuls snacks are kosher, low in fat and low in sodium. Other than the Lemon Vanilla Koala Krackers, Ive also tried Lucky Duckies Cheddar Cheese Crackers and Oatmeal Raisin Crocodile Cookies. Very light and tasty!"
1,"Excellent John Michael Montgomery is a great country artist.I love Friends and What I do Best. I wonder why he did not release the singleWhat I do Best? I will soon purchase his new CD. Keep up the work ,JMM. You are a super singer."
1,"Good if you are a visual learner This book is full of visual ways to remember nursing knowledge, and contains cartoonlike illustrations and pneumonic devices as a way to reinforce and remember various medical conditions, drugs, etc. It is a good way to simplify and streamline information if you learn visually. I would recommend it for NCLEX preparation, and while it helped me feel more confident and prepared for the test, I dont really think it ultimately made a difference in me passing the exam."
1,"RB, Japanese style Pushim stands out among the legions of recent Japanese RBinfluenced singers . . . she actually has a voice, a style, and wellwritten material. This music should be accessible even to nonspeakers of Japanese although she uses only a smattering of English, that is preferable to others who try to sing in a foreign language when their skills are not really up to the task. If you want your Jpop in English, try Hikaru Utada although I think only her very early CubicU album is allEnglish, hopefully there will be more in the future. And if you like Pushim, definitely buy Colorado by Tina!!!"
1,"The Life That God Blesses I have never written a review before, but this book gave me the heart to do it. It is a must read! I cant say enough about how it has truly inspired me to step out in faith and trust in God. I want to read all of the other books that hes written as well."
1,"I am , the book saved my life twice. Having a decadent and unhealthy lifestyle,one day a friend told me the only chance for you to survive is to read and live by the book, Zen Macrobiotic by George Ohsawa. I started to read, it was more like listening to a old man of wisdom. That man had a great life story which he was giving me all of his discoveries to a meaningful life. Life is beautiful.Denis"
1,Dying To See the Movie After reading the book. Which was so very good.By the way I wouldnt hesitate to see the movie. Im looking forward to Halle Berry Jinx character and also Miranda Frost. Which kept my attention while reading the book. Not that I didnt enjoy  but he always his spectacular self. If you dont read the book for nothing else the ending with Moneypenny is priceless.
1,"More than viruosity I came to the disc knowing only that Alkan had a reputation for writing the unplayable. Too often, when vituosity is the goal, the music is sidelined by the acrobatics. Not here. MarcAndre Hamelin interprets and communicates. He presents this formidable music perfectly, at least as far as my amateur ear can detect. In the Barcarolle Op, we also discover a different side to Alkan who, in this peice, is as reflective as a thoughful Chopin and as songlike as Brahms."
1,"Great advice on how to fill up your childs love tank. This book is a follow up to the best seller book for couples, The Five Love Languages, that is awesome and I like to give as a wedding gift. Anyway, it talks about filling a childs love tank by understanding how they like love expressed to them, whether by words of affirmation, physical touch, quality time, gifts, or acts of service. They say that it really isnt possible to detect your childs primary love language until they are about fiveso express love in all these ways while theyre young and until you find out which way is most meaningful to them. One way to determine their primary love language is just to ask them how they know you the parent love them and see whether they describe presents, time together, things youve done for them, etc."
1,"Heart Warming Pulp Adventure Tarzan at the Earths Core by Burroughs is a heart warming tale of loyalty, romance, and adventure set in the hollow earth setting of Pellucidar. Like all of the other tales set in this world it is full of prehistoric creatures of the various periods and peopled by the most anachronistic cast of characters ever assembled. There are pirates, Vikings, cavemen, and intelligent apes as well as some wonderful made up races such as the evolved reptilian race that enjoy feasting on human flesh. Tarzan, of course, finds himself at home in the jungles of this world, and the supporting characters are heroic and delightful to become acquainted with. Even if you have never read a novel set in this world, a fan of pulp should do oneself a favor and pick this one up. It may not be the best place to start on your journey into hollow earth, but it is at least a start."
1,"Good Family Movie Humor, great effects, and heartfelt scenes come together to make a true masterpiece. With potty humor for the kids and sad moments for the adults, this is one movie I cant really find any problem with. A movie that makes me cry and laugh is hard to come by. When Charles set the house ablaze, I found myself yelling along with Carl, and when the main character was nearly slipping off the blimp, I found myself yelling Mr. Fredickson!The video effects were amazing and tit was beautiful. A truly great see. I wouldnt buy it, but I would see it twice. A great movie for families. Some of the lessons kids might not get, but adults will understand. Still a great work."
1,"Works fine. Wish the unit had a separate onlineoffline light. When power to the unit is missing, the single red light turns off only when the warning sounds. The warning sound is like a lot of sounds you hear in the house so it isnt always easy to tell what is happening."
1,"Toriness all the way I really dont understand these people who say they own everything Toris ever done and dont like this album. Are you kidding me? I think this cd is amazing, I bought it a few days ago, it took me some time to finally decide myself to get it because of the bad reviews. But I had to prove it, so I bought it. And what a surprise it was. New Age is the best opening, it catches you and from there to the end of the album its the most amazing journey. I love Toris covers cause she transforms the songs and make em her own, so this album is toriness all the way. And toriness is that magic with the piano and the voice and the whole attitude towards music. I think you could say that you feel her honesty cause you can really feel that she gives her heart to the music.Highlights New Age,  Bonnie and Clyde, Strange Little Girl, Rattlesnakes, I dont like Mondays, Happiness is a warm gun and Raning Blood."
1,"Another great book from Mary K. Greer The first in the new Special topics in the Tarot series, Tarot reversals is the great new book by the author of the classic Tarot for your self. Theres a big wealth of information on choosing your personal approach towards reversed cards critical, as some of this approaches are in fact opposite, suggested meanings for both upright and reversed cards, considerations on what a majority of reversed cards stand for, spreads, examples, bibliography, resources and a very interesting essay on the heroines journey, as opposed to the traditional heros journey suposedly portrayed in normal position cards. Although this book isnt nearly as exercise heavy as Tarot for your self, I still feel it merits five stars. It already would only because many aficionados have been waiting for one such for a long time, but the fact its written by Ms Greer makes it a sure winner. It is a good addition for the intermediateadvanced tarot students library."

1,"Super Colon This is a great product in my opinion.When ever I feel the need to cleanse, maybe I had a big meal and it feels like it is still inside of me, I take as directed on the label and am good to go in about  hours."
1,"Ranks with the best This is a gruesome movie about a man and his fight to survive and save his family. It is extremely brutal, but is also powerful and stirring. The first half starts a little slow, but once it starts, it doesnt let up. One the best movies Ive seen. Ever."
1,"There isnt much to it, but there shouldnt be This stand is perfect. It gives you a few different settings and provides stability. This is a must with any of the trainers, because it makes your bike level otherwise you would be exercising at a serious decline."
1,"Guardedly delighted I purchased this product with some trepidation because the other reviews I saw called it tinny and junk. But it was sold through enough reputable places and offered such a promising solution to my aged and cheap Im not going to pay  for a hearing aide how many years do you think I have left? aunts hearing loss that I decided to give it a try. My aunt is virtually deaf, but this product could be turned so loud that she asked me to turn it down. For the first time in two years I could carry on a normalvoicelevel conversation I didnt have to scream in her ear. And her perception of what I said was  accurate as opposed to about  when I was screaming.The product does not strike me as very durable, but it is not junk either. So far  a few weeks of irregular use  it has been  reliable."
1,"great Sega games I love Golden Axe and Sonic Spinball, but Ecco is what drops my review down to  stars. I dont even understand the game. I really hope they make a sequel to this, maybe one that has Altered Beat, Dr. Robotniks Mean Bean Machine, Ristar, and Flicky."
1,"One of the best albums ever! With out any doubt, this is David Grismans greatest collaboration... It is one of my favorite albums of all time. The music is timeless and uplifting. The musicianship is incredible, the cohesion of the group is amazing, and the song selections are great. The fact that this LP has never made it to CD is unbelievable."
1,"Nine Years of Use And Nine Years of Success I have been using Martin Yates Hiring the Best since the late s. This is an excellent reference book for human resource departments, hiring managers, and, also, for those intransition. I refer to the book when hiring key employees and I encourage those who work for me to use it for interview preparation.Yates provides a review of situational, personality profile, stress, and behavioral interviewing approaches knockout questions and over  questions that will be useful in assessing ability, willingness, and manageability.Hiring capable, motivated people is considered to be the most important management task. A poor decision results in a whole host of negative outcomes including lost time,expense,poor morale, and, possibly, irreversible negative outcomes. Hiring the Best will serve you well when filling open positions in the private, public, or the social sector."
1,"EL QUELITE I did not enjoy the movie as much as I thought I would. I like Tin Tan movies very much and he made more of a cameo appearance in El Quelite. Nevertheless it was enjoyable, but not as enjoyable as other movies in which Tin Tan stars in the movie."
1,"Speechless This series is incredible. People were talking about this and I read about it and decided to pick it up. Needless to say my wife and I are addicted and we got her mother to watch it as well. Great cast, great story, very well done series. Keep it coming, I hope this stays around for as long as  did."
1,"Recommended Ive shared this book with several widows. Heres the latest response to the book from one recent widow I thought I was losing my mind. I didnt think anyone could understand how I was feeling or what I was going through. This book has helped me to see that I am not alone in my feelings or thoughts. Thank you. Needless to say, I recommend this book."
1,"Read also Paulo Coelhos pilgrimage and hit the road An interesting book, that will be criticized by pilgrims who believe that El Camino belong to the choosen ones. I suggest to complement the reading with The Pilgrimage, by Paulo Coelho, and then go and do it yourself."
1,"Rockport Oxfords I got these to replace my favorite old beatup Rockports. These new ones are an amazingly pleasant surprise. After a mild bit of initial stiffness, Im finding them incredibly comfortable after a full work day."
1,Hope for a Hurting Nation This book was so inspirational. The timing couldnt have been better after the disasters of Sept . The book really encouraged me as I read story after story of courageous men and women who had suffered but survived their ordeals. It will appeal to women as well as men. I highly recommend it for an uplift in your day
1,Hard and fast yet still melodic. This is a great CD! Nickleback has achieved the difficult task of creating a true rock album that also apeals to many pop fans.Any one song on this album would make the CD worth buying.
1,Great help I really enjoyed this book. As a Christian it really helped me see that my pain was justified and normal. I would tell anyone dealing with infertility issues to read this book and find comfort in Gods plan for you.
1,"Whats the problem? Ive read some of the negative reviews and I suspect either the wrong drivers are installed or the parallel port to which its connected is improperly configured should be ECP, with no interrupts enabled. Also, if this is set up on a USB hub, it requires a powered hub, not a hub that draws its power from the PC. My experience has been flawless, with fast, quiet, high quality photo and pretty good text printing at a reasonable price. My only complaints have been the delay in getting the Windows XP driver and the clumsiness of the small photo paper feeder mechanism. BTW, photo printing does require photo paper to look its best."
1,"Great Program! Pimsleur Dutch is exactly the program I wanted, and it has turned out to be more than I expected. It is extremely easy to use, and I was surprised at my own facility with the language from the first lesson. Grammar is not taught separately, but the sequence allows you to deduce it easily. The words and conversations give a great deal that any traveller would need for comfort when visitng the Netherlands. As Pimsleur suggests, its easier  at least for me  to learn by ear, and Dutch on the printed page is too intimidating for me to want to take on just for pleasure. Because I had the time, I listened to each lesson several times and heard my own pronunciation and use of phrases improve daily. Really its all the say that I found it enjoyable, easy to do daily since it only took  minutes, and delightfully productivesuccessful. My only complaint is that there is no Dutch II and Dutch III."
1,Met my expectations no complaints. Book was in good condition and delivered on time to meet my deadline. Content wise it is a helpful read with sample documents that provide substantive guidance in drafting of industry agreements.Thanks.
1,"Very satisfied with this product The phones were easy to set up and work well, with no interference. It would have been helpful to know when Amazon changes prices for its products. I would have purchased the phones before they raised the price."
1,"An almost definitive recording of a great work BRIGADOON finds on this CD a respectful, very thorough treatment. About the score, itself, little need be said other than They do NOT write them like this anymore, more is the pity. The only problem with this recording is that it lacks any real chemistry, something that all studio casts have to battle. On the  RCA Original, though the wonderful scores selectively recorded, the duets sound heartfelt, and there is a freshness with the material which only comes with a show being brand new. As well, Brent Barrett on the new recording has an edge to his voice which some listeners will find unattractive. Compared to the lyric warmth of David Brooks on the Original, he seems almost perfunctory. Still, the virtues of a complete version of a great score are indisputable, but do buy the Original Cast Recording first..."
1,"Soulful Stuff! For a first novel, it was quite a read. Honest, emotional, and riveting! I couldnt stop reading it. If you are looking for an excellent read for the summer, try this out.A note the novel is obviously selfpublishededited, so expect a few hiccups, Otherwise, excellent."
1,"Yes, It Is Worth ! Ok...so the price Amazon claims isnt that reasonable, but Id still pay that much for this CD. Final Fantasy IX has, in my opinion, the best music of the series, even if it may not be the best game. My favorite tracks are A Place To Call Home and Not Alone, both off the first disc. The later tracks, like in all FF games, suffer from being mainly remixed versions of the first songs, which is why I gave it a  star rating. Still, if youre a fan of the Final Fantasy series, this is pretty much a must have. If youre having difficulty finding a copy, iTunes has all the FF music available now, which is where I got most of the songs I have now."
1,"Love the taste of this water I did a lot of research before buying a filtered water filter  Im so glad I went with this. Even my picky husband loves this water. SO clean tasting, not chemicaly. Hold so much, we only fill it every other day. Very reasonably priced for something so great. I also bought  extra filters so we are good for  months. Love this water !"
1,"Music that is more than compelling... The music comprising Cafe Atlantico is more than compelling, it is addictive. While I do not understand the language sung by Cesaria Evora, the language of music more than compensates. The musicians are outstanding and complement Ms. Evoras vocal gifts. This recording is a must for anyone who appreciates music at its finest."
1,"Solid thermo book w some application This book is well written and explains thermo science in detail. Not only does this book teach the theory it teaches how to apply the theory in the design of real chemical systems. This book is tough sleding...although not as tough as Sandlers book on thermo, which is also, in my opinion, and better book. IMy only real dislike of this book is the formating...I read this book for long hours at a time in my thermo class it was one of three books required for the course and I must say the text and page layout of the book really bothered me."
1,"Tokyo Mew Mew book This has got to be the best manga i ever read! When I first got this book, one page just wanted me to read more!!! this manga reminded me of Sailor Moon and is very cute too. MUST READ BOOK!!! LOTS of action in this book. nice details too!"
1,"great book by a great author In Harms Way has to be the only book I have actually read from cover to cover. This is the only book that has ever intrested me. It took me two days to read this book, i enjoyed it so much I am starting to read it again.The author Doug Stanton does a good job. If you read at the end of the book you find out that he actually talked to many of the servivors and even joined there club the started. the survivors really enjoy Doug and are happy to tell him anything that he wants, and it shows in his writing. The book goes into such detail it is kind of teaching you things you may have never known.I recommend this book to anyone and everyone that is into war stories or just sruvival stuff."
1,"MM sounds GREAT! I havent heard all their songs,but after reading all the reviews I think Ill look into buying it. Mirror, Mirror is great! I just cant stop singing it. I hope all the rest of their songs are that great!"
1,"Garmin Nuvi GPS Dashboard Friction MountGreat product. The window suction clip that came with the Garmin Nuvi GPS was not practical or easy to use, and did not work most of the time. The friction mount works well and is easy to attach. It sits solidly on the dashboard and console areas. Definitely recommend this product to replace the suction clip for the Garmin Nuvi GPS."
1,"Tristram Shandy reborn... The reviews already posted on the Amazon site are perceptive and useful. The parallel stories of a most unfortunate family get us extremely close to two members of the Schnell family a boy in great pain as he seeks to explain the inexplicable horror of September  and what he sees as his own unforgivable sin, and a grandfather who responded to his agony, the pitiless bombing of a noncombatant Dresden in W.W. II, by embracing silence. One thing to be added is how this author evokes memories of Tristram Shandy in his creative use of the printed page. He fills it, he leaves it empty, he provides one line on it, he offers photos, he even offers a series of photos which show like the old flipbooks a moving piece of the events on the Twin Towers worst day."
1,A must see !!!! Car chase out of this world. Very realistic and sometime hard to watch when details of innocent bystanders being hurt. This a nononsense film. Acting is good but not great. The content of the suitcase never matters.
1,"One of the best ever Wow, what can I say about this c.d besides it was addicting and wonderful. Everytime i get a MxPx c.d I cant stop listing to it. Everyone should buy their c.ds so they get the reconization they deserve. In my  years of living and i know thats not very long I have never found a c.d that my parnets and I both enjoyed. Also in my  years of living I have to say that MxPx and Blink  are the two best bands I have ever liked."
1,"Soft Core but Dull Metallic Effects I love Crayola color pencils and these metallic color pencils have a nice soft but not too soft core, and they lay down on the paper smoothly. However, the colors are very dark and muted. I expected them to burst with brightness and sparkly shimmer, but that is not the case. They lay down dark, with a brownishgrayish tinge thats not very sparkly or shimmery, which is strange because when you look at a freshly sharpened tip, you can see the glittery specks, but the result on the paper is only slightly pearly. The set comes with  colors, but some of the colors like copper and bronze, or purple and pink are very similar. The quality of the actual pencils is good, but the metallic effect leves a lot to be desired."
1,"Luxurious This recording followed performances by these artists at the La Jolla festival in . Andre Previn was still in prime condition as a pianist at this timehow he kept his technique up for so many years while conducting is a mysteryand Julie Rosenfeld and Gary Hoffman are fully equal partners with him. The Ravel Trio is never rushed, and there are some tempos in the first movement that are downright slow. But the whole affair is highly loving. Previns piano playing assumes the qualities of the best French playing, with a traditionally liquid sort of sound. This is especially winning in the Debussy Trio. It was written when the composer was , but is a fully mature and accomplished work. In places it may remind you of Massenet. The string playing here is especially satisfying and virtuosic. The sound engineering on the CD is excellent throughout, with a full tone and superb balances between the instruments. Except for a short timing of  minutes, this is a highly worthwhile CD."
1,"Good mp player but the pedometer is a joke This item arrived yesterday. It is good looking and easy to operate. The wireless earphone is fantastic. Good sound quality.But the pedometer is a joke it is too sensitive even I set the sensitivity level as low. I tried  steps, and it shows more than  steps counted. Even any movement of my arm caused several steps counted."
1,"New England Court Records It is so well organized, it will be handy for many future projects. I am impressed with its depth of coverage and its human tone with what could be an unfriendly presentation. Thanks immensely for putting this reference into the hands of those of us scrambling for answers to our New England genealogical puzzles."
1,Call FisherPrice Customer Service for Vista Software  My daughter has had the FP Player for  years and loves it. She doesnt like the headphones so we got the speakers for it and its like her own little boombox. Shes had it since she was   and its been through alot. The major issue I have with the toy is the software that goes with it. It needs lots of improvements but is workable with Windows XP. My new computer has Vista and with lots of searching on the internet I find out that it is not compatable with Vista and with more searching I find out that I can call customer service for a Vista patch. They told me it should take about  hours to recieve an email with the software patch.Their customer service number is .Hope this helps!
1,"Hard to find at this time but worth the wait... Not out en mass yet so it was difficult to obtain one for my PDA which is also new. Light, clearly a boost to memory space on my PDA, it is something you wont be able to do without if you have large programs that require lots of memory for instance, I run a few large medically related programs on my PDA which have a huge memory burden. I was worried about backward compatibility since my PDA only recommended SD cards as large as  MB but it proved to be of no concern as the device I have recognizes the card and all of its memory space. Of course, expense is a concern but Im sure that will come down in the near future as well since this media type is proving to become an industry standard. Get one! unless you can wait for the  MB cards to show up."
1,"cute for a baby, but floppy I purchased this costume for my daughter, and she wore it when she was  and a half months old. Its nice in that its very soft, and closes with velcro so its easy to get on and off. Its soft and snuggly and pretty simple my daughter just wore it over her longsleeved jammies since it has no sleeves. I would say that this is probably more appropriate for a baby over  or  months old, because its a little long, and therefore the top and bottom sort of flop over. Overall though, it makes a good comfy, easy costume for a baby."
1,One of best series ever I remember reading these as they came out in the s and I couldnt wait till the next came out. Lucky readers of today get all three novels in one book. Ivce reread these countless times over the years and its always as good as the first time I read them. My only regret is that Ms. Cherryh has never revisted the mri in all tese years. Id have dearly loved to have seen their fate with their new allies in a new conflict.
1,"The almost Complete, Original and Genuine. In the autumn of  I was a thirteen year old schoolboy when Python appeared it was love at first sight and over the years I grew to appreciate the subtelties even more. I bought the Best of... DVDs from the BBC and enjoyed them, but something was missing and it wasnt just Australian tennis stars investigation into the intelligence of penguins!Now that I have the complete series in original sequence I can see that the shows were planned as complete self contained entities. I recommend all my fellow Brits to buy this... it isnt much more than the exerpts and you get one but not both of the german shows.Im off for a lemon curry... enjoy!"
1,"Works well on dog pee odors.. I contacted the company and they advised me to not use it around my parrots.So I havent. Which is a bummer,because it works so incredibly well on the carpet in my computer room.My oldest dog has Congestive Heart Failure,and has had it since he was young.Now that he is older,he has started peeing in the house.I use a belly band on him,but sometimes he has an accident when I forget to put the band on him after he comes in the house.My bad.Not his.Anyway...I continue to look for a product that will not kill my birds instantly,or ever. Vinegar hasnt helped.So I will continue to use this product where I can.It really does work,and the smell isnt too perfumy or chemicalsmelling."

1,Very Infomative John Annerino gives his readers an abundance of information about the trails and geology of the Grand Canyon. My husband and I especially like the compact size of the book  great for tossing in a daypack while hiking the canyon.
1,"Fun for little ones! My  year old got this for his birthday and just loves it! His  year old brother played with it for a little bit, then was bored. The sounds are a lot of fun, and really add to the excitement. Some of the cars work better than others, which can be a little frustrating if they cant get their favorite to ever win. I would highly reccomend this for  year olds."
1,"A favorite with our children when they were infants  toddlers. We received this as a gift from a friend who was an early childhood educator. As young parents, we were puzzled by the gift as we werent interested in presenting ABCs to our infant daughter. However, we did not understand how much this book reflected her world with colorful pictures of children and toys. Our daughter would crawl to this pook and pour over each and every pagea very inviting book for an infant!"
1,"Not Bad For An Only Option If this is the only way to get an MP player to work in your car then go for it. Only the pickiest ears will be disappointed with the quality.Your songs will have that radiofeel to them, you know what I mean? That kind of sound that is clear enough to enjoy but is obviously radio quality.Bottom line Your options are limited with older vehicles and even some of the newer ones, so if this is the last possible option for you then theres no reason not to get one if you really want your music in you car."
1,"Remove the slide  mold alert! The slide is attached to the pool on the bottom left and bottom right side. There is a space under the slide where water can sit and get trapped. Ours became moldy. I ended up cutting the slide off the bottom of the pool this does not affect the actual pool wall itself. This solved the mold issue AND created much more space in the shallow pool. When there is no slide, you can easily fit  toddlers in this pool. Ours lasted all summer. It kicked the bucket in late August when we had a bad storm. But it did very well the rest of the season! I plan on buying another this year!"
1,"She loved it I myself have a Invicta OB  thought I would get the  for my wife she always said how much she liked my Invicta.these are really good looking watches and so far working great..........My wife loves the watch, so all is good. I highly reccomend Invicta"
1,Leannas Review The Minstrels Melody is a really good book. Its about a  year old girl named Orphelia Bruce and she wants to be in the music business. She is really talented as people tell her. Though the one thing that is standing in her way is her mom. Her mom only lets her perform in church. Orphelias idol Madame Merrita comes to town. Mandame Merrita is keeping her eye out for talented kids. One of the places to see those talented boys and girls is the St. Louis Fair. On her way to the fair Orphelia discovers secrets about her familys past. Sounds like a good book? Read the book The Minstrels Melody to find out those secrets. Its a real page turner. I recommend this book to people who want to read a good mystery that excites you in every chapter. I hope you read this book and enjoy it like I did when I read The Minstrels Melody.
1,"A great guide This book has wellwritten and practical advice for communicating with seniors. Best of all, Solie explains the reasons we have difficulties communicating. I love the suggestions for tweaking the way we talk to seniors. It helped me understand why my mom perceives things differently than I do. Ive tried several of Solies suggestions with satisfactory results. I am amazed at Solies insights into senior behavior and thought processes.RB"
1,"Coppelia or The Girl with the Enamel Eyes Hello Balletomanes! If youre looking for a great video of spectacular dancing or if youre interested in learning about ballet, this video of Coppelia is the right thing to buy. This ballet adapted to screen is the story of the crazy Dr. Coppelius and the toys he invents. After many mixups, a local girl named Swanhilda must pose as his favorite toy, Coppelia, in order to keep him from knowing that shes snuck into his workshop! Its a hilarious story and a great ballet for st timers."
1,"Challenging and enjoyable Ms. Barton has written a thoroughly engaging and involving story. That it is her first novel makes it all the more remarkable! The narrative moves so seamlessly from one paradoxical episode to the next that I hardly noticed how my assumptions were being challenged. The testament is both innocent and wise, so the reader cannot help but share Yves delight, sorrow, pride and wonder as he observes and records the marvelous events of his life. The other characters who inhabit the world of Mandragora are simultaneously bizarre and believable. Some very funny episodes balance the underlying seriousness of the novels dilemma.As the novel moved toward what I understood to be the inevitable outcome, I became more and more reluctant for it to end. Despite the difficult choices she poses for her characters and her readers, Ms. Barton has written a story that is easy and satisfying to read. I look forward with pleasure to her next novel!"
1,"True Elightenment This book contains a remarkable array of spiritual Truths, all dealt with in depth. It is a great work invaluable for the true seeker of spiritual Wisdom. Each page and chapter contains priceless gems to meditate on and ponder. It deepened my own committment to God  the Path. Leadbeater writes eloquently yet understandably of the Spiritual Realms and the Higher Planes of existence,as well as of wellknown Spiritual Masters and Teachers. It is inspiring and uplifting giving hope to a troubled World of perfection to come. I recommend this book to all who seek to Know and Understand the Divine."
1,"Great product! I just received my tongue and groove set. I agree the packing could be better, but thats not Tool Cribs fault. The bits come in a molded plastic container that is for hanging on a display wall. Its not a sealed package, its made to be opened. It appears that Amazon ran some tape around the package so it wouldnt pop open during shipment. Freud really needs to put wax on the bit so its protected!! Even Rockler has theirs covered with wax in their display box at their store. That said, mine was fine with no dings and it works great. Its nice to have the ability to quickly adjust your tongue and groove bit for different widths of board.So mail order is a little risky in this instance, but Amazon is always great on returns. If you buy this one off of the shelf at least you will know if its dinged up or not."
1,diaper champ I am using the Daiper Champ for the disposal of my colostomy bags. It has saved me many trips outside to the garbage can. Now I only need to empty it once a week. There is very little smell. Of course there is more smell when you open it to change the bag. I am considering putting in a toilet deoderizer for this purpose. I am very happy with this product.
1,"Time Ran Away For a short read, Running Out of Time is top notch. The begining was not as exciting as I thought it could be. Toward the middle of the book, Jessie, the main character, is escaping her reconstructed village to search for help. As her journey continues she runs into dead ends and events of great stress. After a long time on the streets she finally meets help. But can she be sure that the help she gets will help her out or kill her? MR.?"
1,"Get the facts to back up your gut feeling! Ever have that feeling that someone isnt telling you the truth  the whole truth? After reading this book, you will have the tools to evaluate your hunches.Nance is an average guy who writes in understandable language. With that said, some topics, like the chapter, The Eyes Have It, make take a few rereads to really digest the point.Nance offers many trythis techniques. And you can really use them.I highly recommend this book for anyone who is in a situation where she feels that deceit is happening."
1,You could never go wrong with Veronica Mars You can never go wrong with Veronica Mars. The best series I never watched while it was on TV. Didnt realize until it was cancelled that it was so much more than a teen movie. Unbox is great but Id spend a few more bucks and buy the DVD if you can. You get some bonus material including the gags. I think its worth it for something you will watch over and over. Also Seasons  and  are very reasonable on DVD but not available on Unbox.
1,"This is the type of Garbage you dont throw away! Hello  if your looking for great music, then you need this CD , you wont be dissapointed by it. Milkis my personal favorite, it makes me want to cry..tears of sympathy and of joy for this great song, i dont care who knows it..its wonderful, and Shirley Manson has a great voice for all who appreciate great voices, she can really sing, and touch your soul. Have a nice day."
1,"Outlaw lores darkest angel For more than  years, Jesse James has hidden out in the badlands of the American heart, a moral paradox, half myth and no more than half human. In outlaw hagiography, he is surely the darkest angel. Now, The Chivalry of Crime, an impressive first novel by Desmond Barry about the unholy terror of Jesse James, allows readers to touch the very root of violence in human nature and explore the American fascination with outlawsBarry, a Welsh immigrant fascinated by the fantastic tales of the American West, bit off a huge hunk of frontier mythology and chewed it fairly thoroughly. As a new work of reimagined history, The Chivalry of Crime is perhaps not as literarily weighty as Stephen Harrigans Gates of the Alamo, nor as quirky as Cormac McCarthys Blood Meridian, although Barry is a writer of equally enormous talent. The books flaws are rather minor and technical, and it remains an entertaining historical yarn."
1,"Awesome I liked reading this book. I enjoyed reading it because it always kept me on edge. There are many things I liked about this story. One of the many things I enjoyed was the fact that that this could very well happen in real life. Its not one of those stories that has fake characters and activities that could never happen. I really liked this book better than any other fiction story I have ever read. If you enjoy reading mystery stories, page turning stories, or the edge of your seat kind of stories, then the book called, Flowers In The Attic by V.C. Andrews would be a great book for you!"
1,"MasonDixon Knitting This is a great book. I bought it for one particular pattern but discovered it contained loads of really great patterns, lots of helpful hints and great reading. This is not just a knitting book, it is a book to keep beside you to pick up and read whenever you have some free time. Im really glad I decided to buy it and most of my knitting friends are going to buy it as well."
1,"JURASSIC PARK  In JURASSIC PARK , Dr. Alan Grant is paid by an adventurous couple to take them on an aerial tour of Isla Sorna, the island where the rest of the Jurassic Park dinosaurs remain. The plane ends up crashing, and the group becomes stranded on the island, and they have to figure a way to survive the dinosaurs and make it back to civilization."
1,"Very Moving. Eventhough I havent seen the movie, after listening to the CD about  times, it grows on you and now I cant wait for the movie to come to this side of the globe. Was a little unusual at first but after a while, one begins to visualize the Passion in greater detail. The trailer soundtrack is not on this CD. Its on another CD by Peter Gabriel Long Walk Home Rabbit Proof Fence Track Gracies Recapture. Good thing its seperate thouge dont want the name of the composer of the Last temptation of Christ to sully the beautiful and TRUE masterpiece of the PURE passion. btw the track  on the Rabbit CD is the only good track. It must have been sanctified by the REAL Passion movie. All the other tracks are noisy. Have a Holy Lent and God Bless."
1,Walk down memory lane I gave this set to my Dad for his birthday. Since he is a paramedic himself he loved them. We always watched them when we were little so it was fun reliving the good old days. Good classic TV that the whole family can enjoy!!!
1,A pretty Good Game I really like the concept of this game. Some things i like about RPGs is unieqnessi dont know if thats a wordand length.And boy does this RPG have both.This game is on the Playstation and it has  discs but with length comes a problem not letting the game get old. The game is addictive to a certain point but then it seems like the storys reppetitive.There is however a very cool unieqness about this game.Additions.When you attack you must hit the X button at rite time to continue the attack.As you complete the attack you get spirit points which give you the power to become a dragoon a powerful thing with good magic and strong attack.Well as u totally complete the attacks they level up with so many completions.As your charecter levels up you get different attacks to level up. This was not my best writing but the addition system is hard to explain. Well i give the game . overall.If you like RPGS and u have the moneyand timeget it.
1,"Beautiful...one of my most treasured cds I first heard Marc Cohn in all places, the grocery store. True Companion was playing and I had to put my head down on the cart handle I was crying so hard. This is the most beautifully romantic song I have ever heard. I immediately went out and bought the CD and now consider it one of my favorites."
1,Excellent Product and Timely delivery The product is excellent. I have comcast highspeed at my home and Belkin Router connected. When I changed the modem I have to call the company and provide them with the serial  info. and mac address from the modem. I also have to reset the in Belkin router. This was done with the fabulous customer service by BELKIN. This process can take some time but dont get frustuated.
1,Cool wear I am pleased with the hat quality as well as the timely shipment.Hopefully this hat with the fabric extension across the nape of the head will help shield my husband from further skin damage.
1,No Time to Say Goodbye A close friend of the family gave me this book shortly after my husbands suicide. Feelings of uncertainty delayed my reading for a brief time since I was not sure I could read more about something I could not wrap my mind around in my own life. My thoughts grieving my husband consumed me then I finally wanted to connect with someone who understood this. I realized immediately I could maintain a focus with her for it was not written in an exhausting ongoing form and to my surprise even though my pain remained I actually started to feel fortunate. This was a beginning of healing in my mind. Anyone that has lost a loved one due to suicide needs to read her book. It will help in ways that cannot be put into words. I was very grateful for No Time to Say Goodbye.Sacrifice of Love How can we comprehend?
1,"Mom of  and  year old  Best book ever My children are  months apart and are now   and  months. This book was just out right before my  year old was born. My friends and I  children under age  all wish we had this when our first ones were born. She does not judge you, she helps you. The sleeping through the night recommendations are child and parent friendly read  sleep researcher books in addition to this one. The breast vs. bottle feeding combination actually works and the only place I have ever seen it. No matter what get the page where it tells you what physical actions could indicate what conditions. For example, pulling legs up to stomach and high pitched scream, check for gas!!! Considering I have the ungrandma as my mother, I really needed this. It was as if I had a wise old grandmother at my side. Highly recommmend it."
1,"Realizing the problem Bloesch is very helpful in identifying a problem in contemporary western Christianity, many Christians are not paying attention, but that does not change the reality of the situation."
1,Swell I love Liz Damons Orient Express...She has such a smooth and clear voice...also her band and backup singers are very good also....Its hard to choose my favorites but it has to be  Yesterday.
1,"A Subtle Classic. It is difficult to say which R.E.M. cd is their best, but I feel that AFTP is the one. Murmur, Up and Green would be close behind though. AFTP is a nice, consistent, cohesive cd.  tracks and none of them are bad. Those who dont like R.E.M. should start here and then try the aforementioned discs. This album is a must have for any music fans collection, and its worth the money. It contains the hits Drive, Man on the Moon and Everybody Hurts. The other  tracks are just as brilliant. This cd doesnt suffer from repetitiveness or blandness which can accompany some of R.E.M.s other discs. Buy it."
1,"Should be mandatory reading for MBA students and all CEOs Ive been working globally on people issues for too many years without finding guidance that works in most cultures, at all organization levels, and for any industry. I think I found it in this book."
1,"Fun Toy   yearold Boy Loves It My nineyear old wanted the ICY for Christmas. So far it has held up. Although we hooked it up to the ipod nano, the ICY will work with any sound. We put him by the TV speakers and got a kick of ICY flapping his wings and lighting up.The ICY is very simple to use. Just add batteries.For twenty bucks, its a good value and satisfied my sons wishes. I am so lucky he did not ask for a Wii!"
1,great product My wife and I use IBM clickity clack keyboards.They are about  years old but the best keyboards ever made and hopefully will work forever. Having read about people having problems hooking these to USB ports I was delighted to come across the review by LF LittleFrank Saying how well it worked with his IBM keyboard.Well it works great with mine too. Just plugged it in and away we went. And with a Dell laptop. Im just using it with the keyboard. The mouse had a USP connection.
1,"Sublime is...... Sublime! I have all the sublime cds and its great to see the best songs from all of them on one cd. Sublimes greatest hits is one of my most favorite cds, I just wish it had more sublime songs on it,  just isnt enough. This cd just cant be summarized in words. The only thing that I can say about this cd is that its so original and fresh, sublime will never be forgotten for their contributions to american music."
1,"I  Gilmore Girls The Complete Series Collection of the Gilmore Girls is fantastic. Not only because everything comes in a fantastic package, but because the show is awesome. The witty banter between Rory and Lorelai and all the other characters is wonderful. This is one of my favorite tv shows because it really pulled me in, and I wanted to know what was going to happen. Only shows that make me cry are the ones that are worth buying and this is definitely worth the purchase."
1,"The songs are all good This is the first album Ive bought by John Denver and I must say it was a very good buy. Although I really dont like country music, his songs evoke feelings of peace and happiness if one is living in the countryside of the US. Somehow his songs takes us there even if we are not physically there."
1,"A book on the Roof of the World! This book was written from my parents prospective of living in Labrang, Tibet. The experiences of living where we had no electricity and rode horses when traveling. It is a place of remote traveling and friendly Tibetans, once you get to know them."
1,"Helping us See Again...Beyond Critiques of American Consumer Fetishism I loved this book, partly because I love this photographers eye. Are the pictures documentary? Sure. Are they wry? Often, though not always. They are beautiful in the most strange, farfetched, formal aesthetic sense shapes, colors, imaginary visual lines. That about sums it up. Stephan Shores pictures exist on many levels simultaneouslyone reason they are worth owning in book form, able to be revisited many times over a long time. Shore has a genuine gift, and he shares it with whomever takes the time to really look. This older work is relevant to contemporary production worldwide i.e., Thomas Struth. Hopefully you will enjoy this book as much as I do."
1,"Good Resource For Teaching This is a great resource for anyone wanting to teach from the book of Matthew. It is not a technical commentary, in that it does not discuss the Greek grammar very closely, but it is based on solid behindthescenes study of the original language. Its primary value is in synthesizing the meaning of the text, bringing out the sound theology of it, and giving the preacher lots of good material for a message."
1,"Beautifully illustrated When I decided to buy my own copy of Peter Pan I wanted to have one with illustrations. I looked at every illustrated copy I could get a hold of, and this one has the best illustrations I have ever seen. There are about  illustrations total, all beautiful oil paintings, with a wonderful map of Neverland in the front and back of the book. The details in the paintings are also amazing, you can look at one again and again and each time find something new, especially with the illustrations that take up a full two pages. This really is something special."
1,Top Canning Ive been going through winter waiting to get to the growing season so I can start in on the canning season. This book has given me lots of ideas and tips to employ this year and has kept me dreaming.
1,"Informative I never thought Obama was a muslim, dont believe he was born in Kenya, but did get the impression he was an extreme liberal  a socialist. This is a fresh viewpoint, comprehensive  it pulls together info from different sources and covers where hes coming from, where he wants to go taking us along!. Explains his odd behavior.I believe this will be relevant now and after the election, whether he is reelected or not. He will go down in history as a President of the USA, one term or two terms. Do you know who he is?I also recommend the DVD  Agenda. Its a review of the cultural changes in the US over the last  years."
1,"Tastes good, a bit too sweet for my taste It does taste good, and is indeed a bit too sweet.I really liked that this produce is only made of whole ingredients Mango Puree, Sugar, Honey, Apple Cider Vinegar, Ginger, Habanero Peppers, Spices. You can taste the mango, ginger and pepper right away but its not quite strong.I used it last night on top of some grilled Mahi Mahi with good results.Mango is pretty sweet, so maybe theres no need to add as much honeysugar to it."
1,"Excellent speaker stands These are excellent speaker stands  even at twice this price. They are sturdy, adaptable to a wide variety of speakers, conceal the wires, and attractive in a very simpleunderstated way. Havent seen anything this good at anything close to this price. Bought  pair for my rear speakers on my Onkyo  system  after getting them found them suitable for my front speakers also  ordered another pair and a pair for my son. A very satisfying purchase  ordered on Sunday  recd on Wed  free shipping."
1,"Lifechanging! Lifechanging may sound like an overstatement, but I assure you it is not. I cook from scratch about  of the time, in addition to canning all sorts of pickles jams tomatoes etc. I used to have a rather ancient electric food chopper that was a handmedown from my husbands aunt. I hardly ever used it because it turned everything to mush. It finally died, so I bought this based on reviews and because I wanted a black one to coordinate with my other small appliances. I was able to DICE  lbs of peeled tomatoes in about a minute, that includes time to dump  refill it twice. A quick pulse peeled  cloves of garlic, a few more seconds and it was perfectly minced. I am SO happy with this. This is going to be a HUGE timesaver for me!"
1,"Full Moon in Leavenworth, WA October , Chris Ward and partner, Ross, played an exclusive show for members of the FBI National Academy Asssociates at the Fall Conference in Leavenworth, WA. They entertained us for  hours with new and old songs. They were outstanding! Great music and performance. Their show was a perfect ending to an excellent training conference!Thank You!Denise"
1,"Is Snoop Trying To Keep People Interested? Could this track be Snoop trying to bring back the popularity the orginal did? This certainly is an example of Snoops style and rapping power, with some killer verses and an incredible chorus. It all comes down to wether your a fan of this style of rap. If you like this track, then you could be limiting yourself to Snoops latest stuff, such as Dead Man Walkin and Tha Last Meal instead all the old stuff. If your a Snoop fan, this is just going to add to your collection of Snoop records.Happy Rapping"
1,"Lolz were had I enjoyed this book very much. Usually I dont like compilation books, but I had no expectations going into it. I had already read the authors Last Summer and Looking for It, and enjoyed them immensely. So I picked this up for a ridiculously low price, and read it within a few days.The stories are entertaining, sometimes even downright hilarious, and always told with Fords usual flair. I found myself reading between the lines in certain stories, as if he was speaking directly to ME or about me through each chapter. That gave it a personal warmth and connexion that I really liked. I could really relate to a lot of what he was saying.But I would place this book somewhere between the humour section and the gay literature section of the bookstore. It achieves the best of both worlds, and none of the worst. I will definitely continue to enjoy this authors work."
1,"The core of the core of Janes Addiction Here you are, youve finally put your hands well at least your eyes on it! Yes, no doubt, youve find the CD you need. The one and only one Nothing Shocking. This is surely the best CD of Janes which already means a lot. From the first track to the last one, this album is GREAT! And even much more... The guitar is punky, the drums are hypnotic, the singers Mr Perry Farrel himself voice is heartwhirling and the bass is hipmoving. In a whole, this album is unique and obsessing. Listen to it once and youll be addict for the rest of your life. Sincerely, eyes closed in your best chair or jumping wild on the dance floor, you will be moved by Janes. Ive listened to a lot of music, different styles, different bands, but no one has ever given me the wish of jumping over the sun cause the moon is clearly not high enough but this very album from this very band. To summarize, cest de la bombe baby!"
1,"One of the Most Well Known SciFi Novels Out There, For Good Reason. On a world where winter dominates, it is amazing the amount of warmth Le Guin brings slowly to characters that at first seem cold and heartless. This, combined with the odd lifestyle the people on this planet lead, make this a great novel. The relationships between the characters are amazing, not to mention the awesome descriptions of the planet and some of the long journeys made across a planet of ice!"
1,SPIELBERG EVER!!!! This is one of the best Spielberg movies Ive ever seen.It is really unforgetable.It has a magnificent cast.Even though the underlying is abi t questionable the plt is woven intricately and delicately.The way RyanDamon is finally found took me a bit by surprise.However to cut a long story short this is a MASTERPIECE!!!!
1,"Misery on Steroids I really enjoyed this book. Reading some reviews I was expecting a pure gore fest, but what I found was a story that was a pageturning suspense thriller that I just couldnt put down. I dont think I took more than  breaths while reading the last  pages. Disturbing? Yes. Horrifying? Yes. Entertaining? Absolutely yes."
1,"Old Tractors and guys like Roger! Mr Welschs mechanical ability is only surpassed by his entertaining writing and observations on life. I have read all three of the Tractor Trilogy and have developed a curious desire to restore one, even though I have no where to do so in my urban environment.Hats off to Mr Welsch and his delightful works.Now if he could only make plumbing so enjoyable to read about!"
1,"degree of separation In a philosophy in which the city of the dead is made up of only those for whom someone is alive to remember, what happens when theres only person left alive? An intriguing story with multiple perspectives, this book explores the idea of how many people one person comes in contact with over a lifetime. There would have been five stars for this book if the ending had been less drawnout and ambiguous."
1,"Great fan I use this fan for my Mac because it tends to run pretty hot, my husband even had a battery semiexplode so I try to keep mine on a fan whenever I use it. This fan is surprisingly quiet and feels really sturdy. It fits great under my  laptop and under my husbands  as well. The newer version of this has a great new design. The price on Amazon is much cheaper than I saw in several online and regular stores when I was shopping around. All around great buy!"
1,"Excellent I purchased this, with much trepidation, based on one persons  star review BUT indeed this is a wonderful video. The music is very appropriate and peaceful, the instruction is clear enough for beginners but the instructors expertise is clear and will provide learning for many, many hours to come, and the instructor is wonderful, no silly jokes that will get annoying, very to the point yet not dry, seems very genuine. I am very pleased."
1,"My Cat LOVES These Of all the toys he has, my cat loves these the best. He carries them around in his mouth and will actually play by himself because they bounce in unpredictable directions. Hes never been so interested in a toy for this long. All cats are different, so I can only speak for mine. Hes young and full of energy. Every time I buy something on Amazon I add these toys to my order. They are small, so they get lost easily. Oh, and they are solid colors, not multi like the picture."
1,"A decent overview, good for people switching from nonVisual Sometimes too many details, sometimes not enough, but overall a good balance. And the methodology of walking all the way through one project works."
1,"A Treasure of Insight, Perception and Beauty A rare work of discourse on the divine through pith prose condensed with deep meaning and essays on the nature of God, man and the universe.This along with the second volume contain some of the most intelligently written clear expressions and descriptions of our universe and the nature of that which we call God.An illumining work that can be savoured intellectually and appreciated for its beauty in the depths of ones heart.Highly Recommended."
1,"Skeptical at first When I received this book, I was surprised that it appeared the author had selfpublished. I was very happy to find as I began reading, I could not distinguish this book from one distributed by a major publisher. The story line is good with different theories, as usual, about the powers and origins of the vampire. I thoroughly enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone who is interested in this genre and is interested in supporting the independent writer."
1,"Get Ready Everyone better listen up to this one. I got it  weeks ago on vinyl when it came out and the J Peters remix is hot. It is already  on the dance charts and isnt even out on cd single yet. Give this song  weeks and I guarantee it will be as big as Whitney. Just give it a few weeks. And when it comes out on single, dont miss it."
1,"Irreverent Genius What can I say about the writings of Harlan Ellison that has not already been said, some of it in court, assuredly. Funny, insightful, irreverent, and powerful, his style shines through no more clearly than in this collection of his shorter works. From the deadpan imitation of Ellisons style by Stephen King in the introduction, to the nonfiction accounts of Ellisons failed attempts at creating a TV show and writing for the Walt Disney Company, this book will have you laughing, crying, and contemplating the meaning of life, as any great work of speculative fiction should."
1,"Fast and Easy Printing photos is easier than going to a Walmart kiosk. You can communicate directly with the printer and print out a photo in a reasonable period of time, with excellant quality. With two paper trays, the photo paper can be placed in the second tray, and text paper in the main tray. Text printing is extremely fast. I am surprised that the printer takes up less space than my old Canon printer."
1,"Very Heavy  Hard to Move, but Does a Nice Job I bought this vacuum because of the great price and the Dirt Devil brand. It is very heavy and hard to move the back wheels are small and narrow swivel wheels. Once it is set on the correct height bare floorhigh pile it works great. Changing these settings is somewhat difficult you have to lean the vacuum back with one hand and change the knob on the bottom with the other. It does do very well with pet hair, I have three dogs in the house and it gets up their fur! The attachments are nice the hose is a bit hard to pull out, but it might be that its still new and not worn in. If I had it to do over Id probably buy a self propelled or lighter vacuum, your arms will get a great workout using this vacuum! Overall its okay, it does its job, but I know there are easier, lighter ones out there."
1,"It really works!! This is my first review ever...but I felt compelled to recommend the Dunstan Baby Language DVD, especially to new mothers. It took me a little while to hear the sounds within the cry, but after a couple of days I was able to distinquish them each and every time. As a firsttime mom, it has given me the tools needed to understand why my baby is crying and provide him comfort more quickly which has made me more confident in this new, wonderful role, and most importantly I can tend to my babys needs sooner. I am sharing this DVD with another soontobe new mom and I will ask her to pass it on to another...and so on. It really does work. Thank you Priscilla Dunstan for sharing your special gift with the world!"
1,"Excellent album I came accross this singer by accident  or rather, by luck. A friend of mine had send me a couple of samplesongs and then I was hooked, just had to get the album myself. But that wasnt easy, Denmark didnt have anything of her, so I had to have another friend purchace the album for me. This I have not regreted, its in my top  favorite albums in my collection."
1,"An Awesome Book This book is great! The author is my fathers best friend and all of the people that i know that have also read it said that it is agreat book. I am so glad that Eddie got to right a book. It gives a lot of detail about what a cop has to go through, and it gives the real stuff not some stuff you see on tv or in the movies. By the way........ my father is PK!!"
1,Combat Police I was a Military Policeman in Viet Nam. I enjoyed this book very much as it was factual and informative. Its about time the MPs got the recognition they deserve. How can I contact the author?
1,"A Decent Bicycle Seat I got this to replace the seat my bike came with since the original one was making me sore after riding for a couple of hours.When I first sat on the seat it felt pretty weird but I got used to it pretty quickly. Its way more comfortable than my old seat I dont get sore from sitting on it although I rarely ride for more than a couple hours per day.Not sure if its the best seat out there, but its definitely a good value."
1,"Genial, como siempre Soy un apasionado seguidor de Manolo Garcia desde hace muchos aos. Sus trabajos con El Ultimo de la Fila eran sencillamente geniales, no solo por su estilo, tan personal e inimitable, sino por sus letras y musica, llenas de poesia. He de reconocer que cuando el grupo se disolvio pense que su musica no volveria a ser lo mismo. Estaba equivocado. Manolo ha demostrado de sobra su calidad y su arte."
1,"slow start, good finish I bought the book based on the good reviews. After about a fourth of the book I was quite bored with it and went online to see if it was worth continuing. It seemed so. After the long, long part about the depression ends, the book becomes a real pageturner with some great insights into English and America culture. Very hard to put down and a very satisfying read!"
1,"Two Thumbs Up for printer and Amazon I had this sent free shipping. As usual Amazon sent me an email saying it would be  weeks and it showed up in  days. I think they just do that to try and get you to buy better shipping.Printer works great! Quick, quiet and has very nice features. I love that it prints on double side, I just wish it could do double side copying like the brother. My only other thing I would like is if the flatbed was legal size. But over all, I give this an  out of  score."
1,"impressed the shoes fit they arrived in a timely fashion and best of all, they were on sale. I work in a laboratory and am on my feet  hours a day on concrete floors and these are very comfortable and kind to my feet and legs. What a deal!"
1,"FOX WTF over! This was one of the best SCIFI ever conceived, the kind that would even send Gene Rodenberry back to the drawing board. But, FOX time slotted it wrong and like all networks that screw that up point at interest in the show. If you dont like SCIFI this will probably change that. If you like SCIFI this will probably make you love it and run down to join the USMC. Okay, Im exaggerating a little...It truly was a work of SCIFI art. And please dont compare it to those horrible Starship Trooper movies. I would love to bitch slap the people who made those. Buy this you wont regret it! I honestly think, put in the right time slot and the severe beating of the Starship Troopers movie makers, this show could have seriously hurt the Star Trek series of the time."
1,LITTLE TEAPOT I recently purchased a cast iron teapot. The picture was deceiving and the description didnt say how many cups it held. Its really cute but only holds  cups. I can live with that. Down side is lid just sets on so falls off when pouring and is very hot. It also has a basket for tea leaves inside which I like as I harvest and dry herbs and often use a teaball.
1,"very insightful as well as humorous This book really helped me look at eating in a whole new way. It is so much more than a diet book. It is also a medical book, teaching how the body processes all foods and what actually takes place, whether good or bad. I think it is very important to read the entire book rather than skip to the back for the diet and exercise program. If you dont read the book, then the diet and exercise wont mean anythingit will just be another diet and exercise program in a long list of others that havent lasted. This is the only book in this genre that has really impacted my eating habits."
1,RollerCoaster Tycoon  review Roller Coaster tycoon  is one of my favorite simulation games. I think the nd version is better then the st. The game arrived in a timely manner. It had no scratches. It was in perfect condition. If you like tycoon games or the sims this may be a game for you.
1,"Vampires are more than just a cape and a casket Ill tell you right off, Im a vampire fan. Ive read dozens of vampire books. Some good some downright awful.These stories will not disappoint true vampire fans. Even if youre not a fan I urge you to try this book and see what all the fuss is about.My favorite story in the bunch is Triptych di Amore by Thomas F. Monteleone. It is a very sensual story that drags readers into a very rich, full world of its own."
1,"nice, inexpensive alternative to a backback! Well, after taking this bag out for a camping trip and going to the cafe among other things, this laptop bag is a nice inexpensive alternative to using a backpack. The padding is nice for when you accidentally drop it a little too hard or some other minor accident. It also has plenty of pockets to hold papers for work or school, a mouse, headphones, and other gear you might need on the go. The only two issues are that the bags interior has only  strap to velcro down your laptop, which also isnt centered so your laptop will probably slide around a little in the case but the padding will prevent damage. The other issue is that the interior pocket doesnt have a velcro or zipper to shut it so your papersgear dont fall out. Set those minor issues aside and it is a great deal for those who need their laptop on the go."
1,"Good Product Works well, but should come with a charger!Also, if your main focus is to watch videos, look elsewhere. The screen is small and the battery runs down quickly when playing videos.But, for music playback, it works fine, was worth the money."
1,"A book for any soccer fan. Well writen and understandable. I thought that John portrayed life in Kearny very well, and did an excellent job of stirring up the emotions involved with playing the beautiful game. The glorious ups and downs that he had through out his wonderful career were wonderfully and with full detail laid out for the reader to lap up. The last pageturner Ive read in a while. An All around good book. Go Revolution!!!!!"
1,"Glad I bought it on Amazon I bought this watch on Amazon for my husband, who is an avid runner, and he LOVES IT !! He sometimes has difficulty with the heart rate while running because of sweat so he says but otherwise no complaints and he can be a tough critic."
1,"What a wonderful book!! Now, I admit that I had a hard time getting into this book. The reason...The Ten Commandments! The image of Charlton Heston parting the Red Sea kept playing through my head. I eventually got over it, all due to the narrative that this wonderful author told this story. I found myself captivated. Hurston made Moses human, with human needs and problems. This made his faith more real. Wonderful, I cant praise it enough. Check out Chapter , pg.  for a famous quote. I couldnt help but to think that Hurston knew more than she was telling. I have the feeling that she forsaw the Civil Rights Movement, some  years before it actually happened, this book was published in . Very good!!"
1,"Lifesustaining music and rapture It was midway thru watching this outstanding live performance that my young daughter turned her head towards me and asked how come he moves his head so much?. It then ocurred to me that Cat was really singing from another place, another plane of reality. The man loves the music, the music takes him to where his heart wants to be. Hes the dervish here, dances each and every song with reverence and joy, the joy of being alive. So, no matter how many times Cat may be removed from planesflights by the forces of darkness, the music and life lives on and on. That which does not perished and cannot be severed.Great sound. Lastly, watch for the hard jammin of Cat in Tuesdays dead where a string finally breaks off his Ovation guitar...which does not stop him!"
1,"Indispensable! Positively the most comprehensive presentation of a very complicated, everchanging arena.Joeseph Lowery has a writing style that is easy to read. Despite its three inch thickness, the book is well laid out, well crossreferenced and very well formatted where the reader can spot the important stuff at a glance. Better yet, one can go back for deeper details. Ive read a lot of books in this field. Very few have real meat to digest, and the others just skim the surface. The DW bible gives you answers. Best yet, the author anticipates where the readernovice could go wrong. Having been there, done that, he guides the reader around the pitfalls rather than allowing him to fall in it! Awesome job!"
1,Rings a bell of truth This movie rings true to me  and confirms everything I have learned over the past  years of studying the aterlife. Its a wonderful gift to the world right now  when we all need comfort and reassurance. I have no doubt that Chico Xavier is having the time of his life  having crossed over himself in   and is happy that one of the books that he and Dr. Luiz wrote has become this beautiful film. Kudos to everyone who worked on it!
1,"Very cool baby carrier... I love this BabyBjorn baby carrier, the color is great, the product is great! It hold my little one tight and stay comfort, my baby like this as well, feel like I am holding him always."
1,"Best  Easiest Wax there is Using the Black Magic for years now. It is the best and easiest wax ever. Even if you forget to buff it out, it come off with ease and leaves the hardest shine you can find. No reason for expensive wax, this really does the job"
1,"Enjoyable magazine and wonderful resource I have been subscribing to this book magazine for over  years. During that time, I have been exposed to so many wonderful books and authors that I never would have heard of.Not only does the magazine cover fiction and novels, but it also covers other genres and interests as well.In every issue they interview a book club and the club shares what books they have loved or not liked so much. They also have a have you read section which interviews people on their favorite books.So if you want to increase your exposure to books you otherwise may have missed, this magazine is perfect. Its also enjoyable reading in and of itself. Their reviews have also saved me from reading books that I really wouldnt like after all."
1,"A sad but good book This book really good and its very sad, I agree that true love conquers all but I disagree with the thought that he should have lived. When I first finished it I was like, no!, he should have lived, but Lurlene McDaniels shows a very important point, life isnt happily ever after."
1,"Perfect Combination I finished the new paperback of Raising Atlantis and agree with the reviewer from Jakarta, who has the bestreviewed review of this novel Raising Atlantis is the perfect combination of the writings of Clive Cussler, James Rollins and Matthew Reilly. You get adventure, military hardware, unexpected plot twists and some romance. Its an exhilarating read."
1,"This Mom loves everything the dinosaurs do! I am so happy with all the dinosaur books, my kids think they are funny and I give huge praise to anything that will get my kids to do tasks they might otherwise hate doing. A little side note the book How do dinosaurs eat their food actually got my daughter to eat BROCOLLI!! Come on how great is that?!?!"
1,"Highly recommended A highly underrated cd, this album finanlly erases all of the rumors that D.C. is all about GOGO music and puts D.C. on the hiphop music map!An ecclectic mix of hiphop, soul, and just plain funky beats,this CD is the bomb! Check out how each artist flows seamlessly on some of the hottest tracks youve ever heard.A highly recommended purchase! P.S. I love Another Level. That track is HOT!HOT!HOT!"
1,"So Long Pixies... Along with Dog in the Sand and the selftitled first Catholics album, Frank Black has finally locked into his new sound. With Pistolero the best of the three, the big man has shed the ghost of Kim Deal et al and established himself as a great modern rock songwriter. The Catholics not only add consistency to newer Black offerings, they are an incredibly tight band who can manage anything Sir Francis throws at them. The albums standout track, I Switched You, should put to rest any worries that there isnt life after the Pixies, and will long be remembered as a classic standout during Blacks nononsense, intense live shows. All of Franks trademark popsurfthrash offerings are here, void of any rules and with enough key and tempo changes to keep everyone happy. Best of all, the Catholics keep up...and keep Black on course..."
1,"The Language as requested This spanish text was on my step sons book list, as a requirement for his final exam, and the book stores were no longer carrying it. After consultation with the Spanish teachers I went to Amazon, found the book and immediately ordered it. Within the stipulated timeline the book was received and according to my stepson his performance has improved as he is able to completed assignments on time thereby improving his grades."
1,I felt there was a sequel to Dragons Tapestry!! I knew there would be a sequel to The Dragons Tapestry!! I also loved this book. It is up there with the other great books. When it ended I was upset. I wanted this book to go on forever.
1,"Good for the worrisome parent I have a VERY active yearold little girl. Ive always been troubled by making sure shes operating within the normal parameters of her age. And this book certainly helped put my mind at ease. As many reviewers have said, this is not a book for people seeking parenting advise per se, but is excellent at outlining the typical range of behaviors for the age. As must have for the nervous parent"
1,"Great coffee for the price I love cofee. Yuban is one of the better ones. Maxwell House is also not too bad and there are some other ones that are pretty decent. Yuban is rich, robust, and stronger than most other coffees I have tried yet not bitter. Overall, I highy recommend it."
1,A Classic Show to Watch THis DVD is great! I bought it a few weeks ago and it is an old Disney classic!The DVD comes with four episodes plus a bonus episode!The episodes are awesome!Especially the ones with Doris Roberts from Everybody Loves Raymond and Frankie MUniz from Big Fat Liar!I would definitely recommend this DVD to any person who loved this show in the past or loves a good laugh!

1,"The Deepest Truth In many ways, this is Yitzhak Buxbaums finest book  the purest, the holiest. Hes done scholarly work before this, deep research  his Jewish Spiritual Practices is monumental, the Light and Fire of the Baal Shem Tov and The Life and Times of Hillel gave us a trove of information that was simply unavailable  but really, if someone wants to know, What was Buxbaums torah?  what was his deepest truth? An Open Heart is the book Id send them to."
1,"Learned a Lesson I have been purchasing hard to find books from another company for several years...this time around I used Amazon, found the book, found it cheaper and got it faster. This book, which is hard to find and came to my attention while researching some other issues, was a great read and loaded with facts which were well documented and sourced. In other words, very little gossip. It was an easy and enjoyable experience to take in this book."
1,"Solo  liter Pump Sprayer I received the Solo Liter Pump Sprayer promptly and in good condition. Ive used the sprayer several times, and it works well. The extension wand and tiltable spray head are real assets  particularly when trying to spray the undersides of leaves. This sprayer costs more than some other similarly sized sprayers, but given the quality very good and versatility, I believe it is a very good value. The only negative comment I have is that I wish the mouth of the sprayer were wider to facilitate easy transfer of materials into the sprayer."
1,"WHEN CHILDREN GRIEVE I read parts of this book outloud at the dinner table. It intrigued my nine year old daughter so much SHE started reading it. She came into my bedroom shocked one day and said, Mom get this...did you know some parents dont use the word dead or died around their children? Instead, they spell the word. Isnt that crazy? Yes it is crazy, I replied.This book is a god send. As a family we were all there when our dog of  years died. We cried, shared memories,laughed and said good bye. It was a perfect experience for our family and my nine year old and six year old were a part of it. Loss is an opportunity for growth...this book helps us with that."
1,"What an awesome cd!!! This cd is amazing. The guys in Silverchair are so incredibly creative and their music is spectacular. I never thought that they would top Neon Ballroom... but they did. This cd contains beautiful songs, love songs, happy songs, sad songs, agressive songs... its such a wide spectrum of feelings. Diorama is the perfect name for this cd. Every song on this cd is great!My friend bought a bunch of copies and gave them out to his friends... No one should be without this cd, he said. I agree!!!"
1,"Its a quick read, but the thoughts it provokes last long. There must be a Hanna in each of our lives in some way, whether she is the lover, the love lost, or the misunderstood. This book brings together so many different ideasfirst love, social issues, moral issues, history. The story told here is too real to not be true, too possible to not be real. Though it is a quick and simple read, the messages it contains are profound and will last much longer than it takes to read the book."
1,"Images of the Spirit Brillant exegesis of biblical material. Has brought fresh insight into ancient texts. Fine example of creative, biblical study of doctrinal matter. I have referred to it again and again in the course of my study. Wish he had more published materials available to the general public."
1,Pure beatin music! I have been looking for this cd for a long time.I saw this cd on T.V and said to myself I must buy it.Anyways I bought it its a good cd for a party or just a fun ride in your car.I recommend for everyone and any one to buy this great cd.
1,"Good Cardio I was hoping for a good cardiosweat inducing workout and I got it with this video. The moves arent broken down stepbystep like with other videos, so you have to pay attention. The camera work makes it easy to see what the dancers are doing so just take your time and practice and youll get the hang of it. The first few times, I didnt worry about keeping up with the dancers, instead I just focused on getting the moves right. It definitely got my heart pumpin!"
1,"A laugh too deep to be audible Sometimes a book delivers laughs that start so deep in your bosom and is so satisfying that you feel like you need a cigarette afterwards. Although Helprin at times falls into the Tom Robbins too darn clever for your own good school of humor, there are moments of pure genius that make you desperately search your lonely room for someone to read it aloud to. Alas, my black lab does not share my sense of humor and I was left with merely a hrrumph. So please read this book, make it a best seller, raise Mark Helprin up to the lofty heights to which he belongs. Also,if you havent done so already, run dont walk to read A winters tale."
1,"Mmm.....Wow! I was introduced to this scent by a coworker who always smelled SO good. I finally had to ask her what it was, and Euphoria turned out to be the heavenly scent! Beware wear at your own discretion. Heads will turn!"
1,"fir for life this is a new idea in eating plans new to me. plan requires a change of eating habits, but is very effective. dont have emergency hunger pangs, and have lost  pounds in a few months. would recommend to anyone. love having nothing but fruit until noon.i dont have to rush around to fix breakfast. i can get on with my day and eat breakfast around noon, then lunch around  or  when i used to get very hungry. then i eat a wellrounded meal instead of snacking desperately.there is also a very good cookbook by one of the authors, harveys wife, marilyn, although they are not married any more, they are still friends, that includes some of the recipes in the original book, and many, many more. the american vegitarian cookbook from the fit for life kitchen by marilyn diamond published more recently.i recommend both books heartily as they have made a vast difference in the way i eat and the way i feel.joan craig"
1,"Helpful  Insightful If youre at all familiar with Stott, you know that he is one of the finest Christian writers of the th century. Anything he writes is a pleasure to read in terms of sheer literary quality, perhaps even on the level of a C.S. Lewis. This commentary is no exception.As for substance, this is an excellent commentary on    Thessalonians. Stotts emphasis is more pastoral and practical than academic. Though he does occasionally discuss the Greek text, he does so in a way that is easily understandable by those not familiar with Greek. His insights are, well, insightful, and easily applied to the life of any Christian. I used this commentary to prepare a Sunday School lesson this summer none of the other commentaries I consulted offered anything substantial that I did not already have from Stott."
1,"Black Power Mixtape The article is a very accurate version of a difficult social time in America. The Black Power movement had taken hold and received lots of support from the Black community because of some of the positive, powerful community programs that were linked to them. This item is a good historical account that young Black Americans should see."
1,"Enjoyable humor relaxing entertainmnet I really enjoyed this book at lot. Lots of amusing stories about family life, New York life, exMidwestern life.Living  miles from Trillums Kansas City home town related to some of his Midwest episodes. The Chigger secton was very funny, even though I was scratching my own bites while reading.I especially liked the stories about the Halloween parades, and taking the kid to the local community musical productions.Lots of funny lines I kept reading aloud from it to my wife  she ended up reading the book to."
1,"Simply the best... Star trek VI was the best Star Trek movie made thus far. Being both dramatic and poignant, this movie has the qualities that all movies should possess. Definately a worth while effort!"
1,"Lots of fun While this book might not be for everyone due to the BDSM eroticism, it is superbly written. The geography and cultures consist of both fantasy and historical elements blended very well. Clearly the author has traveled and researched.For anyone interested in historical fantasy not afraid of sexual elements, I strongly recommend this book.Also, I would have to add that the author uses suggestion more often than graphic representation on the sexuality end, which I feel is a much better way to approach the issue."
1,"a classic ghostly horror flic i remember as a child of  the first time my friends and i went to see this movie it left a lasting impression. i went home that night and certainly did not want to take my d viewer with me. ive always been a lover of horror movies but for some reason that one stuck. then when the new one came out so many years later, i couldnt wait to go see it, and ended up quite disappointed ! if they would of kept the same storyline and left out the r rated features, and left in the fright, it would of been  per cent better. i would certainly enjoy another remake sticking to more of the old classic film."
1,"The Mouse If you want to put yourself in a world of its own. Then having a Logiteck Cordless Optical Trackman is the one for you. It is a very great device and I enjoy every movement of it. Better yet, it as a very good wireless signal and can be use on any surface. Unlike other mouse, this one is superior.I make no hesitation in recommend some to purchase this product. Thanks to Amazon.com, I could not find what I was looking for except this website."
1,"Exceeded our expectations Our  yr old is leaving home. One of his chores was vacuuming the kitchen tile floor. We bought the robot to replace our teenager just expecting it would do an ok job on the tile. Weve had it for almost one week now, and are delighted with its abilities both on tile and on carpet. The tile floor is done at least as well as our son would do it, the results on the carpet FAR exceeded our fairly modest expectations. The dust catcher does get full fairly quickly but the roomba can do a pretty large size room and find its way back to base with no apparent difficulty.Its super easy to use plug in, charge, press clean and we would recommend to others, especially with lots of tile and no time! We plan to use it every other day on our tile we have dogs and alternate with a carpet room."
1,"The best thing that Rollins ever did? In my opinion Henry Rollins isnt terribly bright, wasnt the best Black Flag singer, the Rollins band sucked and his other books are unreadable. But this book is great. The cover is great, the content is great, the photos are great. Hes totally egocentric although he often feigns modesty. Hes still interesting and this book is a nice doument of Black Flag."
1,"Great Book for Undergraduates This book is highly accessible to undergraduate students with a firm background in rigorous proofs. However, I think that it is rediculous to think that advanced high school students could study advanced mathematics and come away with anything but confusion. Advanced mathematics should include rigorous proofs, and never have I seen a high school mathematics student capable of understanding the logical and structural necessities demanded by rigorous proofs in mathematics. The actual subject of abstract algebra may be accessible to highly advanced students, but the reasoning behind the ideas, their utility, and the rigorous proofs that should accompany any study of advanced mathematics will be nothing but a blur."
1,"Looks Great Every time I wear these slippers I get compliments. However, you need to purchase half size bigger than your regular size. I saw this advice in one of the reviews on amazon and it worked perfectly for me."
1,"A Cute Look at Reality I purchased this sometime ago for our daughter and I think at that time it did not connect with her as deeply as it does now. Since she is the only girl in her class of her ethnicity, she understands and appreciates her hair and the many facets of styles and textures her hair can take on. The last time she read the book it generated very positive discussions for her.Simple TruthSimple Truth Too Understanding the Bible In Everyday LifeCatch A Falling Star"
1,"Not the best Tool CD but this CD is still awesome. Although there is a bit of filler, a lot of the songs are filled with meaning. Its also the DARKEST Tool CD yet. The best song on this CD is Disgustipated, but other quality songs are Intolerance, Prison Sex, and Sober."

1,"A delightful book for young early readers Gently written and charmingly illustrated by Kevin Henkes, Grandpa  Bo is a delightful book for young early readers. Warm, blackandwhite sketches showing the love and friendship shared between a young boy and his grandfather enjoying the simple beauty of nature and the turning of the seasons highlight this gentle, wonderful, highly recommended picturebook story."
1,Not A One Hit Wonder Clyde McCoy signed a contract with Columbia Records that lasted three years  and what an impressive three years they were! His distictive wahwah sound shines in all its glory on this remastered CD. A treasure!
1,"For the serious haunter This is a great book with many decorating ideas and references. This is the best book I found on the market. I applied a few of the ideas to my decorations last year and had a few children afraid to approach the door though that was not my intent, nothing truly gory last year. Highly recommended!"
1,"Blocks A forever toy! I am a Grandma to four  and bought two sets of these blocks for each family of grandchildren. They are solid, fun and educationalbest of all no batteries needed. They greatly complement our wooden train sets. We have hours of fun building towns etc. and get our creative juices flowing."
1,as good as its reputation Yes believe the hype this is a great gameI will go as far as saying it is a classic. No value in repeating what many other reviewers said as far as details go. I played most adventure games out there and Dreamfall is a standout achievement.
1,"Brithams Destroying Angel Being the Life, Confession and Startling Disclosure of the Notorious Bill Hickman, Danite Chief of U Basically simply the story of Bill Hickman in his own words. There is a preface from his lawyer J.H. Beadle which is quite insightful. The issue is, was Mr. Hickman truthful in his account. I would recommend reading a companion book like Hiltons Wild Bill Hickman and the Mormon Frontier. It is good to get someone elses views based on their research. I am really glad to have been able to get a copy of this mans most important history in print. It is really a good read. I highly recommend it."
1,"Unkind and Unwise This album survives beautifully, a meeting of gilded pop, mournful reflections, and jaunty spritefulness. No, it doesnt cohere perfectly as a masterpiece should, and yes a few tracks lean into a velvety postgraduate pretence.But please pay no attention to the two smarterthanthou reviews that lie here. That they are riddled with offhand namedropping to other bands, belieing the fact that the reviewers are playing streetwise critics rather than speaking from the heart."
1,"Friendship When a really big guy with no intelligence, meets a little guy with lots of it they immediately become friends. When they clash with their foes they always come out on top.You will love this book as much as I did. It tells how important having a friend is. And when bad stuff happens the two friend help each other."
1,"Diamond Head  Friday Night Rock Show Sessions Raw Fruit Nicely archived live CD release. Likely very hardtofind without spending an arm and a leg. Ive always liked this longrunning New Wave Of British Heavy Metal band. First two tracks here are from a  in house recording session Sweet And Innocent and the sskicking Lightning To The Nations. The rest Am I Evil? heavy influence to Metallica, Borrowed Time, Play It Loud and the other three come from the  Monsters Of Rock festival in Donnington. Lineup Sean Harrisguitar  vocals, Brian Tatlerguitar, Colin Kimberlybass and Duncan Scottdrums. Good live import disc to add to your collection. A definite shouldhave."
1,"Addictive ! Received as a gift and cant get enough of it. Everybody I play it for, no matter what style of music they like, ends up addicted to it. It is so soothing and mellow that you just want it to keep going. Love it !"
1,"BUY THIS AT ONCE You just cant find music like this any more is what an old girlfriend told me as she put this LP into my arms back in the day. And it was SO true. INCREDIBLE MUSIC, between Kevin Ayers incredible vocals and the unreal guitar playing. BUY THIS AT ONCE. YOU WILL NEVER REGRET IT!!!!!"
1,"lawn control timer review The product arrived in a timely fashion. I began the installation but somehow found it more convenient to let my landscaper take over and  minutes later it was up and running. The control timer does a marvelous job and I am very pleased.The instructions could have been more detailed and explanatory. For example, I became intimidated when I couldnt figure out how to hook the electrical wiring to the timer. Fortunately, my landscaper knew how intuitively and it really was quite simple to do.More pleasing was the price. I would have had to pay  to  hundred dollars with other brands."
1,fun and educational I bought this to read with my  year old godson. He loves all kinds of eye spy games. The images are all interesting and different and he loves the treasure hunter theme. I think it reminds him of the Pirates of the Carribean movies. His favorite I spy book is the Spooky one and then this one next.
1,"Shaky Start strong finish Sometimes rambling, but I found myself riveted by about the halfway point As one reviewer said The Gone With the Wind of werewolf novels that turns out to be true, as a positive statement and as a negative critique.Myself not being a fan of gratuitous sex and violence, I was impressed how the author used these elements to great effect They kept the novel from being a stolid and boring Twilight type take on the nasty business of werewolves. Touche!"
1,"THE BOOK of vocal arrangements Gene Puerling was the architect of the HiLos, and being a boomer more expected to listen to the stones, byrds and beatles than jazz, I was harassed for loving the sounds of these four guys. The HiLos sang with Sinatra! Frank was in his own league!My first jazz guitar teacher told me to appreciate harmony check out the Singers Unlimited, or as he said, Genes new group.

1,"Nice kit for the money. I bought this kit over other kits mainly because it was sold through Amazon. Im very happy with it. Like with other kits, the instructions are nothing more than a printed wire diagram on the box. Its a pretty straight forward install. It was pretty easy. The only issue I had was figuring out how to tie the keyless system into the two leads off the actuator control box. It uses a type B locking system. Once I figured out what lock system it uses, it was a piece of cake. A quick Google search showed exactly how to wire it up to the keyless system. It only comes with one five wire actuator so the locks are only controlled with the drivers side lock plunger. Other kits come with two so you can control the locks from either front door. Wiring it to the vehicle couldnt have been easier. A power wire and a ground wire is all there is that connects to the vehicle wiring itself. All the other wires just connect to the actuators with preinstalled bullet connectors. Pretty easy."

1,"Spirits Soar! Ian Partridge is not as well known in the US as he is in the UK, which is very unfortunate. His is the quintessential English tenor voice and it gives new meaning to the word perfection. The timbre and tone of his voice is perfectly suited for lieder singing and this new collection Spirit Of Love provides overwhelming testament to that. Partridge often performs with his sister, Jennifer, as his piano accompanist. Her playing provides a lovely balance to Mr. Partridges voice. There is an intimacy between the two that comes across beautifully in this recording. Purchase this CD now and open up a new world of music for yourself!"

1,"A Christmas Journey I read a book called A Christmas Journey by Anne Perry. I would recomend this book to anyone from ages  and up. This book has some mild violence and lots of suspense. For example, when Viola is found dead in the river below a famous bridge, everyone begins to wonder if someone had supposedly pushed her that night or if it was a suicidal act. Also, towards the middle of the story, another murder happens with one of Violas friends. This story gave so much detail that I was able to draw vivid pictures in my mind. I hope you enjoy the thrilling and exciting story, A Christmas Journey."
1,"Hardshell mandolin case This is a good case for the money. The safety catches are secure and wont wear out before the case does. The fit is snug, but quite big enough. The pocket for holding picks, etc. is large, and the cover holds securely. The case is lined with ample plush to keep the instrument protected. There is room to tuck in a soft cloth for wiping the strings, and I have also fitted in a small chord book. Good protection, light to carry, fastens securelyI recommend it."
1,"Most Logical LearningHebrewbyAssociation Book! If you need to increase your practical, working Hebrew vocabulary in a hurry, this book is your logical tool. Even after I have finished studying each days page, my memory continues associating each picture with its Hebrew name right on top of it. Throughout the day, I can easily recall each Hebrew word on its item learned that morning, plus those of previous mornings study. This is much faster assimilation than just memorizing lists of vocabulary words. Am grateful to own and use this simple, effective tool, but, will give it only four stars due to a serious handicap it lacks both syllable breaks and accent marks. Nevertheless, it remains a worthy investment, far above its modest price."
1,A wonderful musical inspiration  Isaac Stern IsaacSterns visit to Peoples Republic of China and the way he influenced the music students of that nation is absolutely inspirational. Even though the DVD is a little dated  it should be a must for all music students.He was a truly remarkable teacher and musician  the very epitome of a maestro!H.T.
1,"Finally the truth about Thomas Edison. This book reveals the Thomas Edison you didnt learn about in elementary school. It is insightful and intelligently written. Edison claimed that invention was  percent inspiration and  percent perspiration. This book makes it look more like  percent inspiration,  percent perspiration,  percent public relations, and  percent luck. If you are satisfied with Edison the myth, dont read this book. If you seek the truth perhaps in too much detail this is for you. To my mind, the real Edison is far more interesting than the one Mrs. Goldberg taught me about in fifth grade."
1,"Nice for the price We bought these as a backup for some larger thicker ones from Walmart. You only get  in a pack there and they are pretty expensive. I like these smaller ones because we just lay them over the other ones. My son is only two months and already knows how to play the wait until I take the diaper off to pee on you game. You get a million of these pads for really cheap, so I dont mind when he lets loose  and  times a day. Great for diaper changing tables!"
1,"Awesome pedal and customer service...board pooped out twice. First off, WHILE IT WORKED, it was a GREAT PEDAL. LOVED THE VOLUME CONTROL ON IT!!! Had it about a year on the optical board shorted out. Sent it back to Morley, they said that people almost never have this complaint, so instead of repairing the board, they put a new one in and sent the pedal back. Awesome, great transaction there. No problems at all. It worked great for about  months, then the board went out again. Dont know if it was me or what. I never called them back nor did I get another. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PEDAL, BUT....MINE DIDNT LAST AS LONG AS I THOUGHT IT SHOULDVE. Hopefully youll have better luck."

1,"Look at your nozzles before you order this kit!  Ford Taurus LX. I had to replace the washer hose and ordered this kit to do at the same time. I did NOT take the hood mat off first and it said fits most vehicles on the Dorman site. Naturally, when I took the hood mat off the hose barbs on my nozzles were L shaped and these are straight. I ended up using a needle and compressed air to revive my clogged nozzles. The original nozzles go in and out easy enough, but there is no way to adjust the little plastic tangs to keep the nozzles tighter on the hood so they spray on the windshield and not the roof. The second time I had them out to clean them Make sure you run plenty of fluid out of the system while they are off. I did get them to hit the windshield, but I think I had them cleaned better with the compressed air. Dont actually know if my nozzles were OEM or not, bought the car used."
1,"Christmas of a different era This disc wont overwhelm you with music you remember from the s and the s. There are the two principle ones, Brenda Lees Rockin Round the Christmas Tree and Bobby Helms Jingle Bells Rock, and also Bill Haleys Run, Rudolph, Run. Those were memorable songs many Christmases back. But Brenda Lees other song, Im Gonna Lasso Santa Claus, is a real cutie. And Bill Haleys Merry Christmas, Baby definitely fits. Then, there are the two surfer songs.Naw, maybe it wont stir up too many memories with unforgettable songs, but it does give you the Christmas spirit as felt by teenagers of the late s  early s. It sure wasnt a spiritual or religious spirit. Youll notice that here. But the CD is an accurate representation of the times, and definitely an adequate one."
1,"Quality as always from Rush Both the sound quality Vinyl and the overall album as on par with Rush. There is a reason they have been around a long time, and will be around for us to enjoy hopefully for many years to come.This ties with Subdivisons as my nd fav Rush album behind Moving Pictures"

The author makes some good points on how the nature of desktop hosting can shape how the web can and should be utilized for unattended communication. Id recommend this to anyone who wants good techinical information on desktop hosting as well as business owners who want to leverage more of the web for ebusiness.
1,"America, F Yeah! As usual Trey Parker and Matt Stone have succeeded in creating a parody laden with comic genius. Not only is the war on terrorism put in its place, but they also satirize a slew of other topics, such as politically outspoken actors and even the film industry its self with the use of mellowdramatic dialog and a cheesy yet hysterical soundtrack. The feature also feeds the need for more puppet movies. See this film, f yeah!"
1,"... Talk about non stop energy. System Of A Downs sophmore release, Toxicity has people talking, and talking loud. Hailed as one of the best albums, EVER by many critics, SOAD shuts down the skeptics and the critics who thought they could not top their debut album.Not only does it top the album, it blows it out of the water. Serj and he boys have really done their job here, and offer a unique brand of metal that stands out from most of the numetalrapcore sludge out there.A musthave for all rock fans, Toxicity will have you pumped up for a long time."
1,"Love it I love this. At first its shocking, and yes a little difficult to understand but concentrate for a little while and youll pick it up, it is in English afterall. Ive also read the book absolutely amazing and I have to say that I think the adaptation was done really well considering the length and depth of the story line and all the characters.Now just a correction... this film is set in SCOTLAND not Ireland... as it states that Renton goes into the worst bathroom in SCOTLAND not to mention the references to Scottish cities and of course Rentons tirade about how horrible it is to be Scottish.... but i suppose if some people werent so busy reading the subtitles they might have actually gotten the chance to watch the film....But seriously it is definitely worth seeing, its dark, funny, raw and very NOT hollywood infested.. o"
1,"She sees dead people The author lends a great sense of humanity and humor to what could be a distasteful, or depressing, subject. This book also contains some great reporting and journalistic writing. I agree with some of the other reviewers that the composting chapter is the weakest part of the book. The rest of it is a real pageturner.After I read this book, I realized it had lessened my fears surrounding death and dying. Once one understands the biological processes surrounding death, there is a lot less to be scared of. The books upbeat and optimistic tone helps and I think it will encourage a lot more people to be organ donors. This book also made me infinitely glad that surgeons practice on cadavers before taking the scalpel to me!I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys Patricia Cornwell books or TV shows like CSI. Overall, a very educational piece of nonfiction."

1,"A very entertaining romp..... Hmmm... my first thought is  Meg WAS NOT good enough for Sax!!! I am not refering to financial or physical aspects either! They would not have had half the trouble they did if she had just believed in him a little more! of course the story would have been MUCH shorter! lol However, other than that she was a good character.I totally loved Sax  all of his misfit household. They were such an enjoyable  fun group.This was a different flavor of Regency than Im use to reading. Ill have to say though that it was a nice change of pace. JB really does a good job of coming up with original storylines. Ill be continuing to pick up more of her books."

1,The greatest animated feature of all time This film has to be one of the best classic animated features ever made. The animation was ausome for its time and the story line really takes you places. I grew up watching this film so it has a lot of memories attached to it. I cant stress how much it needs to be released on DVD. I would definately be first in line to buy it.

This book is meant for older readers  mainly a girls book, as boys do not really go for this sort of thing . It had a great storyline but the ending was a bit of a let down, not quite how I thought it should ."

1,"Not a Tourist Brochure Britt Montero, a seasoned something crime reporter, works the seamy side of Miami for a major daily. If only half her tales are true of criminals and street people targeting tourists, I wouldnt want to go there, even for a day on the beach. According to Britt and her friends, the producers of the TV series Miami Vice not actually named spent millions upgrading dilapidated neighborhoods to make their level of degradation believable for TV audiences. In this stew of crime, heat, poverty, and traffic congestion, Britt uncovers evidence of raciallybased police brutality. Pursuing such a story not only would sour her crucial relationship with the police, it potentially could divide the city. Its a trendy story, briskly written to pull the reader along. I couldnt say, however, that it stands out from the crowd of books featuring feisty single women, whose lives are full of people under . I listened to the recorded book, ably read by Donada Peters."

1,"Wow Ive had this vacuum cleaner I got from Sears years ago and I didnt like all the dust that was coming out of the worn connection where the bag attached so I looked in Consumers Report and noticed the low price for this one and read the good reviews on Amazon. Thing showed up promptly, again a pleasure dealing with Amazon, and I vacuumed the carpet Ive vacuumed a million times with the Sears and I could not believe how much the Sears had been missing and how fast the bag on the Hoover filled up. I ripped open the filled bag and there was years of .. in it, skin cells, dust, cat stuff, all kinds of yukkie stuff that the Sears did not pick up. I dont have much experience with vacuums, but considering the double filter in this one, the nice attachments and how well it works and the dirt low price its a winner."

1,"Jalapeno Bagels by Natasha Wing This story is about a young boy who is asked to bring something to school for International Day. He is asked by his teacher to bring something that reflects his culture. His mother suggests that he help out in their family bakery to aid him in making his decision. He could not decide between his mothers Mexican or his fathers Jewish baked goods. To the surprise of his parents, the boy decides to take in jalapeno bagels. When his father asks him Why jalapeno bagels?, his son replies Because they are a mixture of both of you. Just like me.I feel this book is very important for the classroom library because it is a wonderful portrayal of a diverse ethnic family. There is also a glossary of Spanish and Yiddish terms for children to learn and recipes from an authentic MexicanJewish bakery. The illustrations of bright watercolors help to enhance the richness of the story. It is well written and holds the readers interest with new words from different languages."
1,"Excellent to fight stress and insomnia I was looking for a good relaxation CD to help me put my brain at pause and fall asleep, as Ive recently started to suffer from insomnia. This was a perfect choice. Both tracks are very soothing  only forest sounds, no thunder, no rain, no ocean. Only the wind, a river in the background and birds. There is also some piano  but the music blends very well with the forest sounds. I also like the fact that its not a guided relaxation, as I tend to wake up when the person is done talking. This CD reminds me of quiet mornings during camping trips. Love it."
1,"Refreshing This story does not follow the standard recipe for a romance. In Side by Side, two girls fall in love, are discovered and separated by their families, and find each other again to live out a happy ending.

1,"Not for beginners, but a darn fine book nonetheless Though this book is way too advanced for the average beginner, if you have a bit of Transactsql under your belt, the Gurus Guide is your fastest ticket to becoming an expert. The book assumes youve read through the Books Online, so if you havent, youll definitely want to before diving in.Once you have a basic foundation on which to build and extend your knowledge, youll find a treasure trove of useful info and expert advice in this book. The chapters on Cursors, Statistical Functions, Fulltext Searching, and OLE Automation are chalkfull of expert insights and are masterfully done, as is the rest of the book.As a whole, the book is among the best technical books Ive ever read. I consult on SQL Server projects large and small here in the Bay area, and I often carry the book with me from client to client. I find myself reading and rereading passages to really glean all thats there. I can recommend this book without reservation."

1,"OHHHH...HELLO JOHNNY!!! I must say, any movie with Johnny Depp is certainly a treat. Better yet when I originally went to see the movie in the theater, there were quite a few kids filling the seats...so its a good movie to watch with children. Good babysitter material. I think Depp truly embraced the character of Captain Jack Sparrow, and Orlando Bloom was great as well. The only reason I gave the movie  stars was because I wanted to see Depp hook up with Keira Knightley by the end of it."
1,"Perfect for Detroiters and former Detroiters This book is filled to the brim with little factiods and information on just about everything related to Detroit and SE Michigan. If you live in the area or used to, you need to get this book. It takes you back in time with explainations, biographies, and photos. Although much of it can be only appreciated by people who have lived in the Detroit area during any of the past  hundred or so years that are covered. Very nostalgic."
1,"One to Buy Well what can I say, the ledgendary Tenth Planet is now available for the first time on video! The reconstruction of Part  is brilliant compared to the poor effort put into the Ice Warriors, it has a different picture for virtually every line, there are a couple of small  seconds of moving scenes in it to. And yes it includes the first regeneration scene too, well it wouldnt be complete without it would it. What I say is to buy this little gem as its one video every Doctor Who fan must have own, and it is also the first ever Cyberman episode."

I decided to get her these even with the cost being rather high. I have  pairs myself and adore them. My feet stay so warm even in the coldest weather.She was so excited that she called to make sure they arrived. I was hoping that the size would be accurate. Happily, for me and for her, they fit perfectly!! She was wearing them when I left her home with the biggest smile on her face. That said it all!!I would highly recommend these. Plus, being an Amazon Prime member, shipping was so quick with free return if they didnt fit. Thanks Amazon for the great service."

1,Game of the year! Better than Halo  No kidding best game I might have ever played. And I have been gaming since  years old I am  now. Have not seen teh PS version but this game is unbelievable. Truly breath taking graphics the game play is the most intense ever! You will not be dissapointed. One word... WOW!
1,"Well in the right mood... Having spent all summer listening to Panics amazing Night of Joy release I was ready for more great live recordings...maybe my expectations were too high...for Jackassolantern did not quite live up to my hopes...Its one thing to be at a Halloween concert and have the guys play fun cover songs or at a regular concert and hear a cover song... Those both work well I think... but to have a whole cd of those type songs does not work as well... not that its bad or anything...almost too much...I found myself wanting a real Panic tune to break things up... having said all that there are some great songs here... Godzilla, Sex Machine  Ball Of Confusion...and old fans will enjoy hearing Michael Houser on some songs...my advice get this and play it at your next party it will fit right in..."
1,"EXCELLENT! Id been waiting for the release of the original version of The Fog on DVD. I was not disappointed. After seeing it in widescreen for the first time since its  theatrical release, I will never watch this movie in full screen again. The extras are just right. A few interviews from past and present. Theatrical trailers, out takes and even an easter egg. John Carpenter knows how to make creepy movies. Scary is one thing. Blood and guts is another but this guy knows how to get the right atmosphere. That is the one thing I have always liked about Carpenters movies. They are always dark and gloomy with just a hint of a breeze added for that extra chill. This is one of those films that is perfect for that late friday night while hanging out with your girlfriend in the house routine. Buy this version of The Fog and ignore the useless remake. I dont care what ANYONE says, no horror collection is complete without this movie."
1,"!TREASURES CLOE ROX!!!!! Hi! treasures cloe is SOOOO cool! Shes SOOOO beautiful and her curly hair is perfect. now for the starz!Fun Bratz are ALWAYS fun and deserve  stars for fun! you can use your imagination and have a great game with them!Educational most people always give a low mark for bratz on education but they teach you to be yourself and keep on dressing the way YOU want, wherever you are!Durability Bratz are really hard to break. to pull off her head takes alot of strength. unlike my scenes whos heads just pop off.Overall  stars for Cloe! she is the best fun a girl could have but i suggest you buy two bratz, a playset, a car, and maybe a boy for a girl to have even better fun!THats ALL!"
1,"A really fun game and also very educational for all ages!! This game is really fun because it has to do with information and facts about a lot of different and interesting things. That makes it very educational but once everybody has made their best guess on the correct answer, you can then wager on other peoples answers rather than your own if you feel they have the better answer. Our whole family ages  to  loved it!! Were always looking for a new game and this one was a big hit!"
1,"Jazz and rock This debut album Yes was the only Yes vinyl album I hadnt been able to track down anywhere, so when I got the chance, I paid as much as  for it. Just to complete my Yes collection.At first, I was kinda disappointed. But this album gains credit with time. And you end up really appreciating it  not only because of the affectional value but also for the music itself.Especially Side One is very jazzy. I See You is an absolutely great jazz song, full of soul and Yesness! In fact, every single track is very worth listening to. And Jon Andersons voice in its youth is very fragile yet very very beautiful and skilled.On the back of the cover, it says ... My second runner in the Great GroupMostLikelyToMakeIt Stakes. And my money is on them! ... Tony Wilson, Melody Maker.You bet!Oh, by the way, Sweetness is used in Yes freak Vincent Gallos movie Buffalo  starring Christina Ricci. Support Yes, watch it!"
1,No complaints Some of Carlins best thoughts. Gutsy as always. Definitely capturesCarlins unique style of comedy and his thoughts on everythingyoull probably find something you wont agree with but still want to hear and laugh at more!
1,"Above average. Its the usual story, but especially well done. He is the magnificently handsome Marquess of Warwick whos bored with all the easy conquests. She is Gwendolyn Tarrant, a stunningly beautiful young widow who is virtuous. He wants her for his mistress, of course shell settle for nothing less than marriage. Ill be on the look out for other books by this author."
1,cars pig I love it. Its cute and you cant find it in any store on the west coast so therefore its special. I bought it for my sons thrid birthday giftone of many cars items he received and he seems to love it.
1,"One of the Best Cameras Ever, but... I have been using this camera for about two years, and I have a long experience in creative photography. I can say without any hesitation that the Canon Digital Rebel XT MP Digital SLR Camera is on of the best cameras in the market today.It has all the sophisticated functions that any professional photographer may need.The only thing that I did not like is the lens I changed it to a Sigma    mm, which is equal to    mm in a conventional SLR. It gives me the ability to zoom from a wide angle lens of  mm to a telephoto lens of  mm in a second, which is a great advantage in many situations,"
1,"Longshot rules!!!! By far one of the best X novels ive read in a long time. It was great to see Longshot back in action, though i was a little disappointed they never once mentioned Dazzler. I think Ann should write a followup to this novel...maybe end up dragging the Xmen into the Revolution to help out Long and Dazz. Other than that little complaint i loved it, especially the whole LongshotRogueRemy love triangle. Look forward to reading more X novels. oh by the way...Longshot could have taken Gambit out alot sooner....hehe"
1,"An Excellent Summary of Canoeing Knowledge Armed with no more knowledge than provided by this book, my twelve year old son and I purchased our first canoe, practiced its use and successfully ran  miles of Class III river last summer. Several experienced kayakers that we met at the river and paddled with for safety were impressed with the skills we had achieved  this was a section of river not generally navigated by canoeists. We only flipped once and confidently avoided any dangerous situations. This was a good kick start to a lifestyle that I think we both will enjoy for many years to come. The book is straightforward but very thorough. Mr. Grants writing style makes what could have been a dry technical treatise an enjoyable read. The appendices at the end with gear manufacturers and additional sources of information are concise and very useful."
1,This little Stamp is Wonderful I have been using this stamp often since I got it. It fits in a compartment of a hard case or a gig bag easily. Its the perfect size to use with lined music paper and it makes jotting down chords to songs so much faster and neater than doing it by hand. The stamp is small enough to fit in on the side margin or between sing along syric sheets but big enough to see easily. Anyone who plays a  stringed instrument and wants to create hisher own combinations will find this little stamp a very useful tool.
1,"See the show if you can then buy the dvd for everlasting rememberance Cathy Rigby as Peter Pan? Cathy Rigby IS Peter Pan. Ive seen Mary Martin as Peter on tv. Took my daughter to see Sandy Duncan as Peter when the tour came to my area and through she was great. Now took my granddaughter to see Cathy Rigby is Peter when this tour came down to my area and I have just one word for the show.WOW!!! So much better then Mary Martin, and EVER so much better then Sandy Duncan.Cathy, is . Unbelievable the things she does. Handstands, summersaults, the flying secquences, She plays drums, sings. is there anything she cant do? Sorry to say, this  tour is her last. Peter Pan is retiring."
1,"I just bought the DVD...Awesome movie!! Ive always liked The Phantom of the Opera...Ive seen the play, TV series about it and I was looking forward the release of this movie. Emmy Rossum is such a talented and lovely girl...and she interprets Christine like an angel. Is so pleasant to hear her sing...that it is impossible you dont fall in love with this movie.There is luxury everyway, the cast in general is excellent...the music is beautiful, when I saw the movie I felt so identified with the story, the passion, the feeling, the beauty of the story that I can say that this is one of my favorites movies ever.I saw it at the movies, then I saw it in HBO, and I ended up buying the DVD because it is a must have. It is soft, delicate, beautiful...a perfect escape of those full of especial effects and violent movies. If you like musicals, you will love this one."
1,"OUTSTANDING SCHOLARSHIP AND VERY READABLE This is the goto book for researchers into the primitive Church in the West often called the Celtic Church. Father Lionel Smithett Lewis, late Vicar of Glastonbury, makes a compelling case for the historicity of St. Josepoh of Arimatheas mission. Fr. Lewis has poured an enormous amount of solid research into just  pages, and has made it a good read into the bargain. There isnt an unsupported position, a wasted word or a poorlyturned phrase anywhere in this remarkably solid and wellconstructed work. If I could give it more than five stars, I would."
1,"It is a great , imaginative spin off from Star wars Zak and Tash go to a planet with strong superstition of the dead. They are looking for a spaceship there. With their Uncle Hoole, a shapeshifter, they find out Dr. Evazans secret. They have many adventures along the way. This was a great book. I cant wait to read the next book in the series.The author did a great of explaining. I highly reccomend this book to any scifi fan."
1,"All the more important now. After Sept , this book, its ideas and its compilation of Bushs malapropisms, meanspirited attempts at jokes, and simple illiterate utterances becomes an increasingly important read. It is sobering to realize that man as unprepared and emotionally immature as George Bush has to deal with one of the worlds gravest crises.Miller is a bit pedantic and long winded in the long first part. So what? He has many important things to say."
1,"Very informative The book was purchased to replace a library book. The one we took from the library got wet LOL, from some triathlon training, nonetheless!. Cheap, informative and easy to understand for any level."
1,Amazing! October Sky is such a great movie! Very heartwarming and being a teacher myself I really love how their teacher inspired them to follow their dreams. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone.
1,"Literary Magic Flute Has anyone else found that Hotel Paradise is one of the Most Important Books they have ever read? It is Martha Grimes equivalent of the Magic Flute, a Mozartian masterpiece, a joyous, magical work unlike any other novel Ive ever encountered! I did not want it to end I was spellbound, entranced, transported to my own childhood where everything burgeoned on the edge of mystery. Mystical, earthy, evocative  it was everything you could possibly want a novel to be. Even the Proverbial One Book Youd Want on a Desert Island! Well, for me  this is it."
1,"A Great FollowUp Im actually quite impressed with Ryans capacity to record, write, and produce an album on his own, especially after working with THE MAN of googoo dolls for the previus one. Hm, pretty damn good. I like this CD, and I was especially impressed by the sound of each songvery different from the previous CD. I actually will go as far as to say that this album may even be a little better than the last. Yep, I SAID IT. I like Hit Me With Your Light and Fall Baby Fall because they remind me of some of my favorites off the other album, only theyre more edgy and more Ryan Cabrera. Go out and buy this album youre sure to enjoy it."
1,"Very interesting book, wellwritten, good detailed book When I first started to read this book, I though it was going to be another boring book. But I was wrong. It was a very interesting book. Excellent followup for Marked by Fire. Joyce Carol Thomas is an excellent author, and I recommend other students to read this book."
1,"must have I love this product and it is now my trademark shower gift for all moms. It is very durable surviving multiple falls by a clumsy, sleep deprived mom. My little girl has grabbed it thrown it several times and it still keeps going.My favorite aspect is the knob which shows which breast you should be nursing with. It is so easy to forget which side was last.I recommend this for any mom!!"
1,"So much for a sophomore jinx! yes, yes, yes, we know, this book like the last starts out with a big coincidence. But its a coincidence that starts a great story all the way. Child improves with this book and makes you love Reacher more and more with each page. Very recommended series so start reading. Cant put book down!"
1,wonderful book I had this book along with chemical dependency for graduate drug class. I have used this book in my psychology and law enforcement professions and find it to be very easy to use and very informative. Great for those who want an easy read.
1,"Excellent stove top kettle This kettle is very reasonably priced. of good quality, and has a very distinctive whistle as others have said, a very mellow trainlike noise.I cant imagine why people have problems with it take the lid off and look at where the spout attaches to the body if the water covers the outlet to the spout, steam will be forced out of the lid and it will whistle. If the water level is too low it will just blo steam up the spout and make no noise.Oh, and the lid should be shut securely as well if you dont put it on properly again air will not go through the whistle or not enough will go through the whistle and it will be low in volume.If that sounds complicated, it isnt. Really happy with this purchase."
1,Highest recommendation for this product. We could not be more pleased with this product. Its our first hd tv and the hd is outstanding. Great picture. Great price. Would recommend it to anyone considering the purchase of a Panasonic lcd.
1,"Lady rox Lady rox! ChChing! Random Its her hit single. But its the worst song on the album. What I mean is it rox all the other ones are just better.  it did get me out of my seat Ch Ching Unlike Random, BEST SONG ON THE ALBUM!. Upbeat, and a  second sample will get you out of your seat! Fiddle With The Volume Fiddle of the roof I get bored just typing it. Fiddle With the volume YES! ROX!A Little Bit Of Shh I wonder if she said like a little bit of fk for me or something or if its meant to be shh duh shh The Battle Good but with a  second sample I never heard Lady. Random Remix Better. A Little Bit Of Shh Remix Better than first. Fiddle With The Volume Remix Good but first is better."
1,"Didnt look like the photo The vest is fine and it is constructed like the vest in the photo. However, it has some rather tacky screen printing on it to make it look like some sort of racer vest. I wanted a plain, solidcolor, so that was disappointing. It fits fine and seems good quality, so Ill keep it. However, keep in mind that your vest may not be exactly what youre expecting.I bought these for myself and my teenage son. Were both slender people and the vest fits us fine. The top strap is NOT adjustable, so I think that someone really large would not be able to fasten it. It should be fine for average sized people."
1,"Book was gift I got this book as a gift and its been wellliked so far. Shipped quickly and was in great condition when it arrived, but I dont know details enough to review content or anything like that."
1,"Good reading but no historical data. As an avid reader of german WWII Autobiographies I was disappointed in the lack of specifics reagrding names, places, equipment and battles but found the book very good reading regarding the human tradegy that is the Luftwaffes destruction. Id recommend this book for leisurely reading but dont compare it to Stuka Pilot, I flew For the Fuhrer, etc.."
1,"Pakistan Reeds Better than Most... Ive been playing bagpipes for over  years. My first practice chanter was a poly regular Dunbar with a brand name reed that never worked out that well for me. After a couple of months, I purchased a couple Pakistan reeds as I was on a tight budget way back then, and I still use them to this day. Ten years ago I purchased a long African Blackwood chanter, and after wasting  on brand name reeds, I went out on a limb and tried one of my old Pakistan reeds, and it worked like a charm! I still use it today. I recently purchased a couple more just so that I wont ever be without them. The price is very good and its just a reed, afterall. This is something Pakistani craftsmen actually do well. Bagpipes are a different story, and I would agree with everyone else here that they should be avoided. However, these reeds are great because they play in ANY poly or wood practice chanter without squealing or doublesounding, and at this price, you cant lose."
1,"Fantastic Free Speech Hybrid FictionDocumentary I saw this on IFC and LOVED it, and bought a copy on DVD. The film is amazing and the extras on the disc are incredible. You dont know whos an actor and whos real!Highly Recommended"
1,"As Promised! I purchased this charger to replace the one I lost for my camera. This charger came brand new in the package, inexpensive and has put me back in business with taking all of my snapshots."
1,"Great Tea But This Is a High Price First tried the Refresh flavor and loved it so I wanted to try the sampler pack and so far it is great! I actually bought it from Whole Foods on sale,  for  and had two one dollar off coupons! So when I saw this price I thought I would let people know it is HIGH! Especially if you can get it cheaper at Whole Foods!! And, as another reviewer mentioned the assorted box has only  bags not ."
1,"miracid plant food This is a great product that I have used previously. Unfortunately, NONE of the stores in my area carry it, so I am forced to order on line. It does wonders for my hydrangea, azalea and blueberry plants. I will order again when I run out."
1,"A desertisland tactics book  hundreds of positions In one of my other reviews I got my LeMoir books mixed up. I meant to refer to ESSENTIAL CHESS SACRIFICES, his awesome collection of modern sacrificial themes which I would urge any attacking player to read. But his earlier work HOW TO BECOME A DEADLY CHESS TACTICIAN is also a book I enjoyed and benefited from. So many positions from the master games were not familiar to me and I own a lot of books, and his practical advice on finding combinations or cunning swindles is superb.This is so much material crammed into these LeMoir books  months of reading material rather than weeks or days. A LeMoir trait is to give several similar examples of the same sacrificial or tactical concept, but in slightly varied settings, which is so helpful. Dont let some other ignorant reviewers put you off  this is a book of real quality, which will give you a competitive edge in games. The five stars are fully deserved."
1,"Engrossing, riveting, brilliant A Severed Head is a dark but extraordinary novel, full of emotion, surprises, and sumptuous writing. Layers  or webs  of meaning make it an excellent choice for readers who enjoy analyzing, dissecting and contemplating literature or life. Human nature  to say nothing of disloyalty, gall, irony and often misplaced passion  are on searing display here. Iris Murdoch is a rare find."
1,"THIS NOVEL IS BOUND TO BE A GREAT ONE!!! I have just begun DUNE Im only on Chapter  and its already captivating me. The concepts and ideas in this novel are extremely intelligent but a slight bit tedious and complex. If you ask me, DUNE is not as much of a Scifi novel as it is a Fantasy one but still, quite a bit of it is Scifi material. Herbert really does great on this magnificent piece of classic Scifi literature!"
1,"This is the funniest book I have read in years! This book is very funny, as you might expect from a team of Terry Pratchett and a member of the Monty Python cast. I loved it, I lent it to several people and they loved it. This book is a masterpiece of comedy. Everyone should read it."
1,"BRs most mature album Recipe represented the peak of Bad Religions experimentation with the formula laid out on Suffer before the lapse into formulaic songwriting on Stranger than Fiction. Its the most melodic of their peakera records, and holds up as their most complete album. It would have been interesting to see where BR would be musically today had they further pursued some of the ideas on this album to some extent, s Dissent of Man echoed Recipes broadened musical palette, but not to the same extent or with the same confidence. Not their last good album, but certainly their last essential album."
1,"Works reasonably well. Decent value. I got this product in order to comply with CAs new handsfree law that started July st. The unit married up to my cell phone very easily and quickly, and it is very transportable and userfriendly. The flashing blue light that other reviewers found objectionable is not a problem to me. You just have to remember to turn the unit off when you leave your car so the charge does not run down.Most people I have talked to on it report that it works reasonably well with only slight degredation in clarity. One of my friends complained about the audio quality, but I dont know if that was due to the unit or the cell service in the area I was driving."
1,"We Love Clifford Five year old Claire, my great granddaughter, received this as a Valentine present from me. The day Amazon delivered the book, she called up to say that she loved the book, and proceeded to read the entire story to me, with only a little help from her seven year old sister. The girls have always enjoyed the Clifford books, and are so happy that they can now read them all by myself."
1,"Great Product Enough has been said about the assembly. I thought the assembly was pretty straight forward. It can only go together one way.....It helps if you have some real tools, but not necessary.Anyway, my initial concern was whether this product would work with dumbbells other than the Bowflex. The answer is ... probably. Mine are NOT a bowflex product, they are  generic set of adjustable dumbbells . The base they sit on is larger than the platform of this stand. This stand has a platform that is curved at the edges to support the BF product. What I did was line the platform with some of that nonslip padding used in silverware drawers and under rugs. I layered it so the base of my dumbbells rested on it, and then used the included straps to tighten my dumbbells down. It works great and holds them perfectly.I totally recommend this product."
1,"Great story but one big annoyance I thought this was a great story, but was very distracted in the early chapters by a glaring to this California native error in geography. The family is supposed to be vacationing in Santa Barbara. The text refers to their visits to Hollywood Studios and Disneyland as if Santa Barbara is in the LA area  its not. You certainly can visit those places from St. B. but youll be driving  hours each way. Later the boyfriend, Luke, says he wants to go to a surfing competition UP the coast in Ventura. Ventura is an hour or so SOUTH of Santa Barbara. This was really annoying me so I had to mentally substitute Santa Monica in LA and fits the details better for Santa Barbara. Blacker and his editor need to look at a map."
1,"Entertaining for young and old An addictive adventure, the earlier levels of Tomb Raider had us rushing home during our lunch breaks to squeeze in  min of playtime. I generally do not like pointless shootemup games, so I truly enjoyed this one. The game offered good mixture of attention to detail, some movement challenges, and relevant predatory targets. The video inserts are fairly well done, but tedious for younger players. Having enjoyed the early levels, I was a bit disappointed in the Atlantis segment, in which a realistic treasure hunt was replaced with a science fiction adventure. In addition, the ending was a bit anticlimactic. The extra Gold levels, however, gave us something to look forward to when we in fact completed the game. Suitable for kids, youll be lucky if you can get Dad to stop playing so that you get a chance!"
1,"Cosequin has helped two of my elderly cats Ive given Cosequin to two of my elderly cats with arthritis, and it has helped both of them. One cat now deceased had fairly severe arthritis in many joints, and the Cosequin alone was not enough to resolve the problem, but it did help. The other cat was younger and her arthritis was not so bad. After a couple months with Cosequin, she was moving much better, and with more exercise and decreased weight, she is now quite lively and you really wouldnt know she has arthritis just watching her.Neither cat has ever objected to the presence of the Cosequin in wet food. I havent tried sprinkling it on dry food, so I dont know how well that would work."
1,"If the Lord of the Rings could be written as a trilogy. . . If Tolken could write a thoughtful, rich epic like the Lord of the Rings as a trilogy, certainly Martin could have done the same, and should have. This forth book is a disappointment. Im sad to say the series is beginning to feel more like a drawn out cashcow than the great work of fiction it could have been. With every new book I hear a cash register ringing somewhere. . . Ill not be reading the next book. Even if i do ill certainly never buy it. Sorry, Martin, youre a brilliant writer but i cant help but feel youve drawn this series out for the cash.UpdateIve given it a bit more time and while I still believe the story could have been condensed, the rich characters and complex story line not to mention the quality of prose makes for enjoyable reading. If upgraded review to  stars."
1,"Polder digital thermometer I bought it for my smoker... works great. It states not to use in a smoker or grill but Ive had no problems. I dont think I would use it on a grill because of the high heat that a grill produces, but for a smoker it works fine."
1,"Dona Barbara I really enjoyed watching this, the storyline moved so quickly I was thinking it could have been a telenovela. I think there are  versions of this made. Produced in  and  as movies and the telenovelas were  and . Ive only watched this one , a bit to young to have watched the  or  telenovelasanybody watch these?Then, I noticed they are airing this as a telenovela starting next week in my areacant wait!!! It will be interesting to see the  production on TV. Edith Gonzalez who I think is amazing! is playing Dona Barbara and they filmed it in Colombia so I know its going have amazing scences.I really like the campotype moviestelenovelashorses, wilderness, scenary, and of cousre latin cowboyso And if you do too, you will enjoy this one."
1,"All Thumbs Up! The women of Literary Essence all enjoyed this work from our man EJD. This was about love, lust, and loss, but mostly about sisterhood, and staying together. We enjoyed the sisters of this novel, and many of our members could relate in many ways. We found much of it to be quite funny. This book took us through all kinds of emotions and still left us feeling good in the end. We give EJD and this novel  stars, for him always giving us wonderful works to read!"
1,"Unjustly forgotten Angel Pavement was published in , the same year as nd Parallel by John Dos Passos. Although more conventional stylistically than Dos Passoss revolutionary montage, Angel Pavement shares with that work a rich and engaging realism. Read it, and you will be in s London, following the lives of a group of employees of a veneer and furniture inlay business. The cast of characters is ordinary, yet fascinating their work and what happens to them isnt all that unusual, either, yet you will care. Priestley shows myriad skills here His ear for dialogue, including dialects, is impeccable his descriptive powers, making use not only of sights but sounds and smells to create a scene, are keen and he writes with an effortless and pleasing style. In short, this is a superb novel, unjustly forgotten and well worth your time."
1,"We love Eric Drachmans books! We are a fan of all of the books we have read thus far by Eric Drachman. The stories are sweet, funny and not boring. The CDs are our favorite part the voices, music and sounds are great. We love the messages. Our kids listen to these over and over."
1,"Story telling at its best I wish Margaret Mitchell had written more than one book. She was a talented writer and one of the best story tellers. Love her vivid description of war scenes and dialogues. Truly a classic, a great piece of American literature!"
1,"Hits and a Miss I enjoyed brewing all three of these beers. The recipes are all the exact same, you follow the same steps to make each batch. Very easy to make.My favorite was the Vienna Lager. It has a rich golden brown color and a nice full flavor. It was the best out of all the beer that Ive made so far.The next best was the Weizenbier. It was crisp, tasty and fresh. Not too heavy. It reminded me of Coors Light.I didnt like the Canadian Draft at all. I was expecting something along the lines of Molson or some other Canadian beer and this was just not good. It was tasteless and boring. Id liken it to Near Beer, it had hardly any kick at all in addition to being flavorless."

1,"For new owners Neither my husband nor I had ever owned a dog before, much less a puppy. We relied on the two books by the Monks of New Skete for our own training as new owners. I cannot recommend them highly enough. These books are for all dogs, not just Shepherds."
1,"One correction. I liked this movie a lot. Timothy Hutton was great. However, the movie was filmed in Tarrytown, NY, a couple of towns above the Bronx, not in Massachusetts as a number here have contended."
1,"handy little attachment Inexpensive, very functional. Increases the sound quality of my personal digital voice recorder. Only problem is you get mono sound, which actually tends to work better for many spoken word recordings. Not what you want for music, but lectures recorded in stereo get distracting as the speaker moves from one channel to the next. If you want a good small stereo mike, check out the Olympus MES. It will be about twice the price though."
1,"Didnt know what to think at first First up, I confess I bought this because Dana Delany was in it. The first ten minutes had me thinking that was probably the only plus. I found it hard to understand the words and it seemed to be a shambles. But then it quickly grew on me and I found the characters interesting and funny. The New Mexico setting, the way of life and the terms used e.g. outfitter and custodian made it a fascinating comedy. I wanted the brothers to succeed  at anything. Everyone turned out to have their own good points. Connie Binoculars was lots of fun. Dana played an interesting woman very well. I wish it had gone on longer. Thoroughly recommended."
1,"Slip, sliding away.... This stuff is really slick! I wish it was a bit thicker yet, more gel like, and I wish the bottle had a different dispenser top rather than the pump, but it really is great for helping you get in tight spaces."
1,clear and easy glad I bought the book. I took the class online through a community college after two c based programming courses. book does a pretty good job of showing both graphically and in pseudo and in actual code c how the data type should function.worth it.
1,"Worth owning even if there were no recipes In this wellconceived and beautifully written cookbookmemoir, Ms. Brennan transports her readers to a rural and rugged area of France that lies only an hour north of the glamorous Cte dAzur. She offers an enticing collection of workable recipes both traditional and nontraditional, intertwining them with a treasure trove of personal reminiscences and invaluable information on foodstuffs. A pleasure to read as well as to cook from.Also recommended Madeleine Kammans Savoie."
1,"My dog likes it This is a funny movie. It is not a hilarious movie, but it is amusing. The plot is a little thin, but its one of those feelgood fluff movies that was never intended to become a classic.To my dog, on the other hand, this is the greatest movie on the planet. He loves to watch it! He gets excited whenever the movie dogs get excited and interacts with the show. It greatly enhances my amusement with the show."
1,"Quality Fifth Studio Outing For E  Co. The release of Eels fifth studio album has sparked something of a backlash from the music press here in the UK. The criticism seems to be that E and his collaborators are flogging the last remaining horse in town to death. And yes, its true to say that some of the songs presented on Shootenanny! would sit well on other Eels outings. But, by the same quarter, it also contains some of Eels strongest work to date. Tracks such as Diry Girl, Agony, Lone Wolf and Numbered Days are as well crafted as any tune in the Eels canon, presenting, as they do, strong, clean pop music, combined with brooding, introspective lyrics. Es voice is as strong as ever, as is his eye for the attractively bizarre characters of life. The less disonant sound is welcome after s spiky Souljacker, and the album is sure to make perfect listening for a thoughtful summer."
1,"A broader view of depresssion Excellent book. A multidisciplinary view of depression, it looks beyond drug and talk therapy without denying their importance. Emmons studied, practices, and writes about other approaches to depression, such as diet, supplements, exercise, Ayurvedic historical Indian medicine and the Buddhist psychologicalemotional types. This provides a deeper and broader understanding and treatment of depression. A richly woven text."

He is transported back in time to ancient China, where he joins a crew of warriors fighting to free the imprisoned king. This movie works on many levels, it is a great action movie with very well done kung fu action scenes involving Jackie Chan and Jet Li, two of the greatest kung fu movie stars in the past couple of decades. In the midst of all of this is a great deal of fairly well done comedy. Very satisfying none the less."
1,A familys haunting This book started out a little slow but did pick up about the middle.We find out in the end that the house was not haunted but it was the land.The book was not a bad read just not one of the best on haunted houses.
1,"Finally, TRUE GRIT done as it should have been to begin with The original  movie was just another John Wayne movie about John Wayne and a complete literal misinterpretation of Rooster Cogburn. It was deliberate to allow John Wayne to play the part that fit his limited ability but everpopular presence guaranteed audiences.This interpretation was written to bring to screen as close to the literary source as possible and that it does. The Coen brothers yet again create a fantastic reimaging of the book.Definitely a worth watch film and the actors a perfectly selected for their roles and each of them bring respect to each character as portrayed in the book. stars and well worth it!!"
1,"Great Book. Great place to start. This book is a quick read that provides a great starting point for those that have realized they are losing their hair. While yes, all the information in this book is available on the internet, that can be overwhelming. This book presents what is known about hair loss in a quick and easy to read book.The best part is that this book gives you the reader hope, and shows that there is a way to slow hair loss."
1,"Good workout! This is my first Leslie Sansone workout video. I always thought the Walk Away the Pounds series were more for beginner exercisers, but after reading the reviews here, I decided to give this a try. Its so simple and basic, yet it makes you sweat and gets your heart rate going. I can see how this might get boring after a while, but what exercise routine doesnt? The music is a little s aerobic class, but I love that its  minutes you dont need a lot of room and it goes by quickly. Cardio is not my favorite thing in the world, but this workout makes it tolerable."
1,"Small but works! I didnt realize this earpiece was so small, but it works just wonderful. I can hear very clearly and easy to sync with phone after Ive answered the phone. Love that I dont have to charge it everyday. I may end up getting one for my husband because he keeps eyeing mine."
1,"Incredible book I cant even begin to describe what a wonderful book this is. It is definately top  for me. The characters in this novel are rich in depth. Emotionally and physically I had a vivid picture in my head about each and every one of them. The pain of a father, a son, an author, a historian book collector as well as a lover. Twists and turns pulling you in to every page. Page after page of magnificant words put to paper to tell what I feel is the most gripping story I have read in a long time. This book had no drag times for me. It followed a smooth trail from start to finish. Carlos Ruiz can write. Read him!"
1,"Stop bending while ironing After years we finally have an ironing board that fits. Maybe we could use one that extended to , but it is so much better to iron at  than the standard  it is unbelievable. This is a great ironing board and the only thing we did was to put a flat piece of wood on top of the iron stand."
1,"Underrated period comedy classic! JOSEPH ANDREWS is a glorious adaptation of the Henry Fielding novel. Done in much the same style as Tony Richardsons previous film TOM JONES. This viewer prefers JOSEPH ANDREWS as a more satisfying film experience. The adaptation from book to movie works better. The performances from all the classic British actors are priceless. The dialogue, filming, editing, costumes and locations are perfectly brought to life. Special mention has to go to AnnMargret for her performance as Lady Booby. You wont see a more controlled, flawless, hilarious performance in any other film. She is striking to watch. Not only in her beauty, but in the delivery of her lines. Her accent is totally convincing. When has an actress made eating asparagus look soooooooo enticing! JOSEPH ANDREWS is definitely one of the forgotten gems from the s. Mixedup identities and bawdiness at its best!"
1,"incredible filter I could not believe what this filter trapped. I was never really aware of what a filter is suppose to do and Im upset that I spent time, money and sneezes on the other useless filters. Thank you M. Amazon please look for the best price you have many loyal followers. Thank you."
1,"Hammond Daddy  A real organ donor Easy on the ears  seems kinda like a musical autobiography of this artists trek through life. The songs are written very well  playing is solid and tight  recording is exceptional ! If you like a slightly mellower version of Springsteen, this is for you. God loves acoustic guitars and a Hammond organ. Wackertrk  and Sunny Sidetrk  are ones to stick in your head. Overall an excellent project  great job Cellar Records !"
1,One of the very best books on jazz! As already stated this book is the kind that you can pick up anytime and flip thru to almost any page and get some quick story that youll learn from and laugh at. Buy two copies because youll want to give one to a friend
1,"Incorrect description The size says   however, the item is . That was the only reason I bought this block bc it was shorter than the others. I had to saw off about  bc of that. I had found a similar item cheaper at a large chain store but not made as nicely. Overall it is made well. I just wish the description was correct."
1,"Help!!!!!!!! I need help! I cant find the key to the libary ANYWHERE! If someone could help me, Id be SO HAPPY! Please just put up a review telling me how to find that darn key! I really want to get farther in the adventure mode, but Im stuck on that one level! PLEASE HELP!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"More from the master As many have said before, this album is Trents return to what he does best. Its one of, if not the best album NIN has put out. Ever. Its a strange mix of musical noise and angst driven lyrics. Its so stunning it completely blows my mind.Its vastly different than With Teeth to manys delight. I enjoyed With Teeth because it was a masterpiece in its own right, but it doesnt hold a candle to Year Zero.Im a little worried about Trents next album. How can he top Year Zero? Well just have to see how things unfold, but until then, grab your copy of Year Zero to sate your NIN appetite."
1,A LOT OF BOOK IN A SMALL FORMAT Great price and a great book. Theres alot more here than youd expect from looking at its size. Author doesnt gloss over our responsibilities bravo but also makes this really fun and charming.
1,This video is excellent! This DVD is excellent. Mr. Thayer really shows you where to find everything and what to look for. I didnt realize how many plants you could use and he also shows you how to use them.
1,"So cute. My mom got these for me for Christmas. At first I thought they were just adorable! Since they were not matching but rather coordinating with  different etching patterns.Then I noticed how HUGE they are. You can fit basically an entire bottle of wine into the glass, filled to the brim. Less refills Honestly though, theyre completely fun and Ive gotten a few compliments already from friends. The only thing I worry about is how thin they are, I am on pins and needles whenever I wash them."
1,"Gentle Visuals and Relaxing Music We have watched this video s of times. It is a great video for younger viewers as it is easy to follow. Classical music accompanies colorful images of toys and other objects.This video was a favorite with my daughter and she usually fell asleep while watching. It was also good for calming her down when she was more hyper.The only downfall I have seen is that kids may want some of the enchanting objects seen in the video.Although the Mozart Effect was debunked, the calm melodies do work well for quieting kids down and getting them to relax."
1,"Fun to Use  Clean Picture! I gave this Flip Video Camcorder as a gift to my daughter and her husband. I had a opportunity to try it out, and now I can see why they love it! Its simple to use and the picture is cleaner than most digital cameras with video! Only reason for the  star rating is due to the frequency of having to replace the two AA batteries. Even under minimal use, you need lots of new batteries on hand! Other than that, this is an easytouse, fun, compact pursepocket size video camcorder!"
1,"My Favorite After the original this is my favorite wrong turn after the original. I like this one probably because I like reality tv. Thats the premise of this one and it works, until all end up dead and s hits the fan wheres everyone go?"
1,"Still funky Limp Bizkit is still one of my top  or  favorite bands. I did not like this record as much as  dollar bill, but it is still a lot better than some of the other crap out there. I liked the overall feel of the first record a little bit better, there is definitely a different vibe. I missed the heavy guitar riffs! Limp Bizkit is still a very funky, and talented band. IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THEM LIVE, GO GET YOURSELF SOME TICKETS!"
1,"The Da Vinci Code For those of us who read for fun, and could really care less whether a book is completely accurate, especially when it says Fiction on it, I would reccommend this book. It was fastpaced, and its a great topic to talk to your friends about, as long as you are looking for a discussion.There are so many different viewpoints on this book, but I have only one viewpoint. It was well written, interesting, and it was twisted in a good way.I would reccommend this book to those of us who read for enjoyment, and arent about to go criticizing every single error. FICTION people. FICTION."
1,"Powerful and accessible Karl Jenkins music is fresh without it being weird, familiar without it being cliched. His approach to harmonic progression is structured and logical, yet still is wonderfully original. Of the CDs I have of his, this is the most traditional in style. It is inspiring and intriguing, but on first listen, parts of it come off as a little ordinary. On second or third listen, however, the originality and craftsmanship comes through. I taught my choir the Sanctus it was easy to learn, and after we sang it on a Sunday as a prelude, we received several favorable comments from the congregation. The most puzzling was I loved the Gregorian Chant you sang..!! The only thing the Sanctus shares with Gregorian chant is the Latin.. Still, the choir loves it, the congregation loves it, and my middleschool and highschool daughters love listening to the uptempo numbers in the car."
1,"Best Show EVER! Ok I have just watched the nd Last Exiles DVD and is it wonderful! WOW! Never have I imagined an anime could be the best story, movie, etc. told ever but it is. It is better than any movie cartoon or anime or book or whatever I have ever seen! If you havent gotten this series yet go out and get it! You will love it! You will watch it over and over!"
1,"Best bang for your buck I bought these a few months ago as a replacement set for my iPod. I was looking for something that would block out sound yet was still easily portable. I found both attributes in these. With the volume less than half up it blocked out all of the sound in a moving vehicle including conversation. The only problem Ive had with them is that since the silicone has begun to really form to my ears, they tend to either wander out of the canals or get stuck in there. Its no real problem, though, so Ill keep using them until they just completely die. Definitely a great product and the best sound Ive ever heard form earbuds."
1,should release the albums that are deleted I have been a fan of tommy page since the beginning of his album where A shoulder to cry on blew me away but however i am unable to find two albums that are not listed on the website does anyone know how to get the albums Time and the album Tommy Pages greatest hits
1,"A Reason to Live The title of this true crime book is profoundly appropriate. More than the story of a woman who survived sexual assault and attempted murder, Hills and Hudson have written an intimate portrayal of several South Carolina families, whose lives were shattered and destroyed by two men on a senseless killing spree in February of ...all because some guys wanted to make easy money by robbing an elderly man. The determination and courage of Wanda Summers is, for me, the profile of a heroine. This is an emotional book it made me cry. With skill and sensitivity, the authors deal with the gruesome facts of the attacks. The details of the court case move along swiftly and then the reader must learn how the legal system can be agonizingly complicated after a guilty verdict and a death sentence. There are some bizarre connections to other crimes in A Reason to Live. True crime readers will not be disappointed with Hills and Hudsons second book! Sobering...poignant...inspiring."
1,"Steve Martin still Has It! Steve Martin plays a small time movie producer, director Bobby Bowfinger and fibs his cast of B actors that he can put his sci fi project together. He convinces them that he has gotten action star Kit Ramsey Eddie Murphy to star in his small time film Chubby Rain. Satires of the movie industry are done so well via the pompus movie exexutive Jerry Kenfro Robert Downey Jr. Bowfinger exploits Ramseys phobia of conspiracy by meeting him at chance locations with his film crew to film him hysterically. The concept is that Martins crew is told this is the only way Kit Ramsey will work. Murphy also plays Ramseys goofy nerdy brother who is hired as Ramseys double. Good work by Murphy and Steve Martin is in great form with his usual clever lines. The movie Chubby Rain is so horrible you cant beleive its actually being filmed this way. Aside from slightly insulting your intellegence this movie is worth a watch. Martin does it again!"
1,"... This game is a very good game, the levels get harder as you go on. You have to beat a person an increasing amount of times to go on to the next level. In every level there are  people max. The only bad thing is, it is an old game so no new cards dont work on it, another bad thing is it is very slow I have Worldwide Edition and after playing it I see it is much faster. I think this game is best for  years of age."
1,"Next best thing to the Big Wheel I purchased this toy for my son when he was . He is now  and his six year old sister still rides it. The handle is a little short and the footrest is pointless. But overall this is an excellent, durable and safe toy. Good indoors and out. When my daughter was about  she got on and quickly flew down an incline and tipped over, only suffering a few scratches. Supervise if child cannot control it. The front wheel has finally cracked after six years which is to be expected especially if youre of the Big Wheel generation. Great toy. Highly recommended."
1,"Incredibly wonderful! Beverly Nyes three paperbacks are among my most treasured, alltime favorite cookbooks. Every recipe Ive made has been absolutely wonderful  which isnt surprising since theyre all triedandtrue family favorites preceded by a brief description of why theyre so special. The selection is quite diverse, from wonderful renditions of the basics to unique ones, such as homemade dry cereal. There are also many excellent craft ideas and economical hintstips. The books are very warmly written youre gaining access to top favorite recipes which youre bound to enjoy as much as the Nyes do. You cant go wrong with these books ... incredibly wonderful."
1,"His best book ever This is the book that turned me into a Ray Bradbury fan, and it took reading a few dozen of his other books to change that. If I read one more nostalgia soaked tale of childhood, I think Ill scream. And when did the mediocore Farenheit  turn into such a classic? No matter, October Country is strong stuff, and if you are a horror fan, you should buy it, immediately."
1,"Clean fun for kids This has got to be one of the best childs sculpting claylike substances available. Our year old played with this stuff at his art camp last summer and it was an instant success. Throughout the week, it was his absolutely most favorite thing to work with. We got him this bucket so that he could keep working with this at home and his creativity really showed through  not only with the four basic colors but mixing them to make all the colors of the rainbow. He has now now worked through  buckets of this and his projects are consistently getting better, more interesting, and more complex as he learns to think ahead through the sculpting process.The stuff is clean, does not smell, cleans up easily, and works well with fingers and tools. It will retain its pliancy for a long time in the bucket  which means that it does take a while to lose its softness and stiffen up into a final product. On the whole, we highly, highly recommend this."
1,Should be on everyones Christmas album shelf This is one of those great change of pace holiday albums everyone should own. The presentation of these wonderful carols is precise but very lyrical. I dare say you may have never heard some of these old familar songs presented with such authenticity.
1,"A surprising gift though the material may seem fragile, theses earbuds definately deliver, the bass on them are so sick, but it also has good sound quality on my nonrap songs, though id assume theyre not as effective."
1,"A COMPLETE MUST HAVE!! Wow, Wow, Wow!!! Goodness Gracious! What an awesome performance by a piano virtuoso. This has to be on my list of must see Piano concerts on DVD. The sound is quality is surprisingly good! I especially love watching Erroll Garner from the side camera view where you can see him work all those piano chords and progressions!Watching this in black and white I think adds to the mood of an era gone by, a musical era that we all can fall in love with!"
1,What I was looking for I wanted a silicone case and an armband to carry and protect my mini when at the gym or on the go. This does the job well. The mini is really secure inside the clip when it is in the case. I like that I can keep the silicone case on the ipod even when not attached to the band.The velcro seems secure on the band and the band seems very durable.I am very happy with the product.
1,"Truly Blessed Comedy Event As a devoted Christian and member of several  step programs I was reluctant to view the copy of Stealing God that my sponsor sent me last Tuesday. Oh great, another comedy making light of the evangelical movement I thought. Believe me, the last thing I needed to hear last Tuesday was more Jesus Bashing. Well let me be the first to tell you and the producers of this fine comic romp how touched I was by the sense of spiritual renewal that permeates the entire production. I love this movie almost as much as I love the Lord. Thank you Stealing God for literally saving my life on a dark night in Mississippi."
1,"I laughed myself to death. Hey its so dumb its funny. Attack Of The Killer Tomatoes is not only a satrie of Bhorror movies. It makes fun of the advertisers, the news media, teen idolsPuberty Love would even make Tiny Tim pull his hair out, and even the Tomatoes hate the song just as much, Broadway Musicals, and even the Opera. Several movies get spoofed here including Lassie, Jaws, and even Superman.Attack of The Killer Tomatoes, is just bad satire all the way though. You will laugh youself to death the frist time you see it. I did!"
1,"Jurassic Park Trilogy I cant say enough about the pleasure that comes from the Jurassic Park Series. I knew when I first read the book by Michael Crighton, that Spielberg would take the lead and make a film. He was the only one that I felt could truly make the book come to life. And indeed he did. All the films are visually fantastic and the screenplays are well written. They are, all three, classics for all time!"
1,"The China Study If everyone in the world would read this book, most would be enticed to follow the advice. Those who do follow the advice on diet and lifestyle promoted in The China Study would experience a healthy life free of the lifestyle diseases seen in the Western World today. I think everyone should read this book carefully and with an open mind. It makes sense. I am alive today because I have followed this counsel."
1,"Entrancing lovely prose and an all too true scenario With respect to those who dont believe that Foster Homes can be that bad, They Can. I worked in the system for several years. I had to get out because I felt so depressed about the poor options kids have in this kind of situation. There are lots of wonderful pages in this book though. It gives hope to read about a girl who could go through the things in this story and survive. I thought the writing could have been tighter and some of the chapters felt like they were filler. But when I got to the end of the book I felt bereft. I need to know how this girl turns out in a few more years. I hope she makes it all the way to actual happiness. I wonder how some of the kids I worked with did."
1,"LOVE this little thing! I bought this to save all the personal stuff on my computer at work as I was leaving a job. This thing is SO cool. Its about as big as a pack of gum but holds TONS of information. Also nice so that it will fit in between other things plugged into the back of your machine. As soon as you plug it in, the software automatically pops up on your computer screen and allows easy drag and drop. What could be simpler?"
1,Great Jewish folk music. The Karmon Israeli Singers were hugely popular in the s. They were even on the Ed Sullivan show I believe. They performed everywhere. Their music is wonderfully upbeat or sadly solemn on the same album. I have always enjoyed the minor keys and chords popular in this style of folk music.
1,"it just made me die laughing! When I first saw this book I did a double take. A bird that skis? And the names! this book is pure humor. Ive been looking everywhere for the other book and cant find it anymore in stores. I liked it a ton and I think you will, too."
1,"Stonker! This album is brilliant, but still not quite as good as Give Out But Dont Give Up IMHO. Classics such as Movin on up and Loaded means that most people will find it accessible from the start, but there is also depth in the other songs too. Im not too fond of tracks   , but the rest is brilliant."
1,"simple, easy, best tea This product is easy to use, and I find that their teas are very clean tasting. I do not have a problem cleaning mine, nor do i have bits making it through the mesh  big or small."
1,"Best book ever This is the best book Ive ever read! If you r  read it! youre smaller? get your parents to read it, both of u will injoy it!!! You will soon be transported on a fabulous boat full of nannies towards a billion adventures."
1,"Defensive Documentation and MoreDocumentacion Preventiva I have read this book. I recommend this book for anyone who would like to acquire basic knowledge of the US Health Care System. It is thorough, yet it is easily understandable for the Health Care Professional and General Public."
1,"Just what everyone needs! rim shot Its ridiculous how many bands nowadays blatantly rip off the Cars without anyone calling them on their crap. Stacys Mom, anyone? Weezer or Hot Hot Heat, perhaps?The reason for all of this idolatry is, of course, because the Cars debut album is still one of the freshest and most vital pop albums ever. The record was released in , and it never ceases to amaze me with just how timelessly perfect it still sounds.With simple, catchy, and infinitely memorable songs, the Cars debut is the official soundtrack to a good time. Easily one of the s best. Just What I Needed is among my top five favorite pop songs ever."
1,"You Cant Make Me But I can be persuaded This book is an excellent reference for training your children. I wish I had read it when my son was younger. I would highly recommend it. Cynthia Tobias is a gifted writer, and makes the book a joy to read."
1,"FANTASTIC So enjoyable! I just finished this book tonight and I cant wait to start on book . I absolutely loved this book. Non stop action fantasy, humorous.. and a little romance to go with it. All you could want in a good read. Loved it!"
1,"Incredibly inspiring! Glenn W. Turner is a living, walking, talking example of his own beliefsyour attitude is your altitude and you MUST Take back your mind for far too many of us surrender it to friends, family, the school system. society and the media.There are a lot of books on motivation and PMA. GWTGlenn W. Turner is PMA in motion.Everyoe should read this book. Its incredibly inspiring."
1,"It really grows on you The first time I popped Whole Numbers Play the Basics into my CD player, I was unimpressed. The album, although well composed and compiled, did not live up to its critical acclaim and didnt have the flow or setting that seemed to come so easily for the groups contemporaries like Boards of Canada and Squarepusher. However, for some unexplainable reason, I didnt take it out of my player for a long time, and found myself listening to it all the way through quite often. Now, I understand what the critics were raving about. CvJs sophomore effort is really an acquired taste, but it is quite beautiful and fits well in the great conversation of electronic music. Definitely worth a listen, just listen more than once or five times, for that matter."
1,Cross Classic Chrome Pen I would recommend this pen as a gift. Its slim design makes it easy to carry in your pocket.My husband has had a pen like this for years and still thinks its the best pen out there.
1,"Incredible book! Done in two days!!!This was an extremely insightful book that proved to be very thought provoking. I couldnt put this book down, proved to be one of the finest I have ever read. While not a true autobio, the tale is wonderfully told and its free....impossible to beat!"
1,"O What A Story! I saw The Story of O in the movies when I was  or  in or around  and was very impressed. This was a time when there was such a thing as an erotic film, that was very very different from porn films. This is a real movie, with lighting, angles and a storyline. It is not just a mindless flesh fest. The main actress Corinne Clery is very beautiful and there alot of other beautiful woman throughtout the whole picture, practically all being seen in the nude. Although sadommasochism isnt my thing, the film still was entertaining to watch. I feel however, that the submissiveness of O, the main character, is not believable for this day and age. This movie may not be for everyone, but along with another erotic movie, Emmanuele, this is a classic of an era."
1,"Cant wait for another one This is one of the best albums I own. Period. A lot of people do think shes gone too far with quirky lyrics, either that or they go into the whole shesoldout routine. Thats annoying, since it ALWAYS happens when a musician who was once littleknown gets a lot of radio play. Oh well. My favorite is Virginia, and the haunting imagery she conjures with the lyrics of that song. My only complaint is the length too short!. I know its a long album, but Im always sad when Gold Dust ends, leaving me wanting to hear the whole storyalbum again."
1,"Finally a good music gift I always dislike someone giving me a CD because it is not usually one I would choose. Even though I happen to like a couple of songs an artist does, is not an indication I want to sift through several of their not so good songs to hear them. That is not the case with this CD! I enjoyed every song on the disc. What a happy gift receiver I was. If you like any of Maroon s pieces, you will like this entire album."
1,"Harmonics Revealed David Hamblins style is very accessible in this complicated branch of Astrology. His book is in valuable for interpretation of harmonics charts,  makes an excellent companion for John Addeys groundbreaking work on this mathfilled! subject. Skip the math, if you like,  use this book for more layers of information from your charts. Especially good for creative Qs, but certainly not limited to that....this is a wideopen branch of Astrology,  this book is an ex cellent place to start! Waves established our Universe...read about them in your charts!"
1,"Best of their last ones. Some may wonder why on Earth I give this movie  stars, but the answer is simple. Of all the mids movies this genius duo did at the end of their career, theres no question about it this is the best. Its slow in places, but there are some very funny scenes like the plank sequence, the storys interesting and the cast is good, especially Leland as the sympathetic boyking. This MGM movie is way better than any of the ones they did for Fox. All we need now is for someone to clean up and restore all of their films short and long talkies as well as the silents, and put them out on DVD. They deserve just as much thorough attention as any other old bw stuff horror classics, etc. being released now. But it should be done soon, before its too late. And no colorazion, please !."
1,Citronella Collar I bought two of these for my Chihuahuas. At first my dogs were confused and barked more since it sprayed them but after a while they figured it out and began to bark less. The only complaint I have about it is when the battery dies its difficult to find a replacement in any store.
1,"Good Reunion Special But The Original Show Should Be On DVD In Complete Seasons! The Carol Burnett Show is a classic variety skit show and its very funny. Now I remember waching this reunion show on television a few years ago and while I wish they had shown more skits and had less talking about them it was interesting to hear Carol, Vicky, Tim and Harvey talking about how much they loved doing the skits and all of the fun they had and you could really tell how much they all liked and respected each other so I actually enjoyed watching their Show Stoppers Special but what would really be wonderful is if they put the Carol Burnett show on DVD in complete seasons. They show this variety skit show on TV on a couple of different TV stations including TVland but they only show  minutes and that is just not enough! A complaint I have about this special is that they didnt include Lyle Waggoner, He was just as funny as Carol, Vicky, Tim and Harvey and should have been included!"
1,"Greatest mens scent..but way too weak Ive enjoyed this cologne for several years now, it gets a lot of compliments from women and men, but why CD makes it so subtle to the point of completely disappearing amounts to a ripoff when you consider the expense. Getting caught in a light rain might fire it up a little, but for me all traces of it are gone in a couple of hours."
1,"Better than any season of Law  Order!! This is a series that should have never been cancelled. Its like a Law  Order episode taking place in the DC Universes Gotham City. The book, while definitely focusing on two detectives, still has a great team aspect and Batman isnt needed in the book but when he shows up its great. Here we get two different storylines and both are fantastic. Greg Rucka has such an amazing feel for these characters. You can tell he loves this book and thats why I love it. The art by Michael Lark and Stefano Gaudiano is so perfectly suited for the events transpiring within its remarkable. Any other type of art style would be terrible here. Overall, this is a fantastic book and I wish it would have lasted forever. Great reading!"
1,"An end of an era So Im writing this on the day I found out that lead singerbassist Peter Steele has passed away at the age of . Very sad... Type O Negatives music was quite important to me in my later teen  early s years, and I still kept up a bit on what they were up to musically. Rest in peace, Peter.This DVD is good for an avid fan, but I must warn you that it is not just a straightup live concert. Unfortunately, for me anyway it is laden with a bunch of goofoffery that is often crude and mostly stupid. I dont feel it really adds anything and was several lengthy scenes of useless content and wasted space.Now its not ALL negative... the live performances are quite good and reflective of times Ive seen them live in the past. If you never got a chance to see them play, this might be something you would like.I came here to review it as the DVD packaging doesnt say WHERE this concert took place  I was hoping the Amazon listing would say."
1,"A Biblical perspective Finally, a Biblical perspective on being single. And even better, one written by a single! While it incorporates reallife stories we can all relate to, Loris book approaches the topic of singleness from Gods point of view. What does the Creator say about marital status, about being content, about purity. So many Christian books on this topic are written by Smug Marrieds  and are very focused on personal experience. This one, by a true Singleton, will bless you with Biblical truth!"
1,Very handy! I ordered this book for my medical billing practice because I needed a smaller paperback book for quick reference. Every definition that I have needed to look up has been in this book. It is very simple to follow and is easy to use. I would recommend this book to any who will look up words on a daily basis and does not want to have to lug out a  pound hardback dictionary!
1,"Caught on Fire and still works!! I dont usually review items I have bought or used however I felt compelled to write this review. I was brazing copper pipe and had the drive around my neck on a lanyard, I know not too smart anyway while using the torch I caught the drive on fire!! It literally melted the case away. I cussed and threw the drive in the trash, my buddy grabbed it out of the trash and asked if I had tried to use it, I said right. He plugged it in and the sucker still worked!! This happened over  monthes ago and still going strong. I dont work for Lexar however I wont be buying anything but their jump drives from now on!!"
1,"Good product. Not Great. My wife likes it a lot cause she can bbq the meat, steak, fish with a little black burn around the meat. All other machines will automatic turn off when it reaches certain temperature so you can never the burn your bbq with a little black stuff around the meat.But my mom doesnt like that much. Thats why I give it a four star only."
1,"Pretty good I still dont think Arch Enemy is Death Metal, melodic or otherwisetheyre too good. Overall, WoS was a pretty solid album, if you like this kind of metal. I think they dialed back on the speed a bit and tried be get more of a grove going on this album. The bonus material was kind of cool as well. I loved the cover of Judas Priests Starbreaker although I really dont like to original vocalist. They should rerecord and rerelase that song. Overall, WoS didnt blow me away like Rise of the Tyrant but it is still pretty good.Recommended."
1,I look for two elements in choosing recordings. I am an audiophile as well as having had a life long love affair with Jazz.The playback system Ive put together has the ability to resolve a recordingwith extraordinary detail..This can work against me if the recording has not been engineered well in the first place.So the performance has to be a good one with good originality and musicianshipand it has to give me my audiophile thrill ride at the same time.I find that the Concord label is really great..Many of the LA recordings areexcellent and fulfill both elements admirably.Im not saying that they are the last word in HIPNESS but very good strait ahead jazz with conceptual and memorable arrangements..I cant speak to the period before Jeff Hamilton because at this time I have not yet listened to the older recordings with Shelly Manne on drums..I recommend this series highly to folks that get a kick out of very well recorded material.
1,"This Is A Terrific VHS Tape   Stars And More This is a wonderful holiday tape. It has superb stereo Christmas music with a very clear sound. Some of the Christmas music is original. The music is supported by vivid original videos, some intricately acted out. Dont miss this one."
1,"Excellent how to book I am not an expert in the stock market, but I have bought some home computers and selected some Internet Service Providers. So I read the first few chapters very carefully for accuracy. I was pleased to find each chapter in the Get Set, Get Online section to be accurate, short but complete, and exactly on point."
1,Lagwagon Blazes Through After Long Absence! Lets keep this short and straight to the point. Fans of the past  albums of Lagwagon should buy this. People who like Bad Astronaut should buy this.If you didnt you should still check out a few tracks online or have a free preview listen at your favourite record store. Its great that bands like Lagwagon still strive to keep punkrock highly energetic ... keep it up Lagwagon! Perhaps Fat Wreck should release Chris Shifletts solo album which Joey Cape has a copy of it seems...
1,"Sexy and Exciting!! Get your Wife or Girlfriend a Mini Skirt and have her put these on under. The excitement of easy access will drive you crazy!!! Fun for cruises, vacations or Weekend Geta away. If you like to play and are not shy then this is a great item for the both of you."
1,"Prince of Satire Florence of Arabia is completely hilarious. Only Christopher Buckley could make such enormous fun out of the Middle East. He doesnt spare any country, people or culture. I silently laughed all through the book and was bereft when it ended. Anyone with a love of satire will appreciate this book."
1,Great Low voltage DC power supply This is a great Low voltage DC power supply  with continuously variable output in the low voltage range. A perfect bench unit for low DC voltage  low current projects.
1,the camera works great I love the camera and the compact size is great for vacations. I just slip the camera into my purse. The pictures are very clear. I would recommend this camera to everyone who would like a compact digital camera.
1,"Very fun game PROS This game is LOT of fun. We played it with my kids and grandkids and we all had a great timelots of laughter.CONS HARD, UNUSABLE CLAY. We actualy had to go out and get some PlayDoh to replace what came with the game. Then it was fine to use. However, Id also recommend they make a larger, more durable gameboard. I see from other comments, though, that the company has actually gone out of business. Too badthis game was a great idea."
1,"Lifesaver but extra features not necessary We bought this product when our baby was six weeks old, as we were having trouble getting him to nap. It has been a lifesaver he will sleep in it for up to three hours we turn off the swing after about half an hour to an hour whereas hed only sleep in the bassinet or crib for  minutes tops. Hes now  weeks old and is still completely disinterested in the music, lights and mobile. I dont know if that will change. Generally were very glad we bought this. Its great that it has the AC adapter, goodness knows why almost all the other swings on the market do not have that feature."
1,"Early King This is a pretty good black  white Elvis documentary. There is some information about his early years  footage from tv appearances  concerts. Also, lots of promo clips from his movies which get somewhat repetitive. Nice photo of Elvis in leather on the cover. A definite keeper for Elvis collectors."
1,"Not a newcomer, but enjoyed the movie all the same The only thing that is keeping me from giving the full five stars to this is that having been a follower of the Chronicles since first reading all three of the originals in , I found some things left out and others not touched on a little more. But the movie still managed to pull me into it which I will honestly admit that I didnt believe it would do. I think that Lestat was played nicely by Stuart Townsend. In my mind, he brought out my envision of him. Never mind the fact that the hair color and such was off because it never really was about that. At any rate. Would I recommend the movie? Yes, of course."
1,Whats the Deal? I am so upset that people dislike this album. This is the best one. Just because Delores finally decided to discuss world issues through her form of expression does not mean that it is awful. Her voice is most impacting and present on this album. A must have for anyone.
1,"My favorite convenience food product! When I first became obsessed with Indian cooking, I taught myself from books, and did everything by hand, including roasting and grinding my own spice blends from whole spices. If you want to teach yourself Indian cooking, check out my So You Want To... guide for helpful cookbooks. Since then, I have tried many premade spice blends, most of them lacking in flavor when compared to what I make myself. And then I found Neeras Garam Masala on the shelf at the market, and discovered that this amazing product is as intense, lively and flavorful as the garam masala I used to spend HOURS making. HOORAY!! I was very happy to find it online at Amazon, because the markets I shop at do not carry specialty products consistently, so I was becoming frustrated when I couldnt find a new jar as my old jar was starting to look empty. DOUBLE HOORAY!! This is great stuff, and now I never have to be without."
1,"The perils of voyeurism What Was She Thinking dont you love the title? is a double character study that is utterly engrossing. It examines the dangers of voyeurism, leaving readers feeling thats exactly what were guilty of ourselves as we voraciously keep turning the pages.Barbara slowly befriends Sheba, another woman in the school where they are both teachers, and equally slowly Sheba reveals details of her relationship with a yo student. Through author Hellers piercing writing, the characters of both women are more fully revealed  and by the end we feel as if our own inner secrets have been probed with a dental pick.Superb."
1,"How history books should be written In the hands of lesser authors, even the most interesting periods of history turn into dusty, academic recitations that are literary sedatives. Rhodes work, on the other hand, is a scintillating read dealing with one of the truly seminal developments in world history. Rich in detail and crackling with drama, its everything a history book should be."
1,Hooked! This manga helps you to understand the .Hack series although i would suggest getting the game first it realy doesnt matter. I was hooked the day i bought the first book i finished it that day. although the animation is sd it fits the story somewhat. This is a must have on your manga shelf!
1,The Benefit Concert Volume  I only bought this CD cause have a large collection of Govt Mule  Alman Brothers CDs  DVDs  like the sound of Warren Hayes Guitar  Vocals so Ill get to the point with The Benefit Concert Vol  was recorded live at Warren Hayes th Annual Christmas Jam in Asheville NC at the Thomas Wolfe Auditorioum on December st  with different talented musicians but nothing like Govt Mule o Alman Brothers Live Concerts four out of five .
1,"Complicated. I never guessed it. I am reading this series all out of order and dont recommend doing it if you can avoid it. However, it works either way. As I said, this book is quite complicated, and I never did really guess the cause of all the killing that had happened. Lots of harrowing experiences lost in the woods with huge bears for Alex and Vinnie to survive and find a way out of the woods with no real help. A very enjoyable read which I accomplished in  days. So it will drag you right into it. I do like this series, and think Ive now read them all. Nice work."
1,"A very good SummaryIntroduction to An Excellent Book I think the titles says it all. At about four hours or so this movie adaptation really is just grazing the top of what is covered in the book. The acting is excellent and everyone does a great job. The cinammetography is really good to. But they really shortened it up, took a lot of important stuff out, and took some liberties...such as Uther didnt build Camelot and Margana Le Fey new that she slept with her brother Arthur the day after the Beltane Fires not like years later. Plus, Guinevere Gwenwyfar, or something in the book was as much of a total freaking bch in the movie as in the book. You want her to be killed at the stake or something. MMMMM steak,,,,Anyways, freaking fun and good movie. But read the book and the prequels. Bradley created a wonderful translantion of a classic classic."
1,"Natalie Babbits fantasticly exciting book! Tuck Everlasting is an exciting puzzle and you gain pieces as you read. Natalie Babbit took a curious topic, pieced it, and twisted it into a fabulous book of great realistic characters, of hanger quality, of mysterious climaxes, and page after page of description. I would reccommend this book to imaginative readers or to anyone who loves a good book. This is what I call a great book! I read this book and loved it! Seeing all these others who know what a good book it is makes it even better! I say read this book!"
1,"best classic ever omg lol I have been searching for this for a long time, thank you alot. I am a very big Final fantasy fan and now cause of this i own every final fantasy there is P am so happy and you rock, peace"
1,"Excellent book with delicious recipes We got this book from the library and loved it so much after trying some of the recipes, we just had to get our own copy! Lots of yummy recipes which are not too difficult to prepare for your family!"
1,"Amazing! Ive been trying to get into an exercise routine for a decade and Ive never been able to until I found this DVD. Its my first Leslie Sansone DVD, but Im sure there will be many more added to my collection soon. The workouts are challenging but Im still able to do them all the way through without modifications. I started very unfit, but now only a few weeks into it, I can feel a definite difference in my body. I was tired of workouts being ridiculous prancing around and Leslies workouts are practical, effective, and to the point. Her encouragement is genuine and theres a general lighthearted feel of just getting together with friends. Ive only added exercise to my life without changing eating habits yet and the pounds are dropping off. This DVD has been life changing for me and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a real way to lose weight."
1,"Mexicos Girl Paquita has captured the essence of Mexican music. She is a woman to be admired, respected, and cherished! Through her exceptional, unique voice one can feel her pain, and understand where she comes from! Viva Mexico, Viva Paquita!"
1,"Simple compelling storytelling This is a great story about love and the passage of time. I normally do not read fiction, but took a chance on this book, and Im so glad I did. The straight forward story telling keeps you in the moment. I thought about this tale long after I had finished reading it. I would recommend it to anyone."
1,"It IS a SACD Hybrid if the copyright is  ABKCO I just got mine and thought the same thing the last poster did  that Amazon screwed up and this isnt a SACD hybrid as advertised. But it IS one. If you look on the disk itself, you will the DSD and Super Audio CD. I was angry at first because I already have the regular CD and wanted the SACD hybrid, but after opening it I am a happy camper. FWIW, it is in a cardboard case and the case says nothing about being a SACD hybrid."
1,"Excellent cd! I love this cd! The songs are beautiful, and Carole Kings voice sounds as good as ever. This special edition with the dvd is amazing. It has a video of Carole singing at the piano, an interview and additional five songs, one of them in spanish, with the argentinian composer and singer Alejandro Lerner. The song The Reason has singer Celine Dion in the backgrounds, spectacular! There are songs cowritten by David Foster and Carole Bayer Sawyer. I highly recommend this cd. You will love it to!"
1,"Nunsense Jamboree I thought was a very funny DVD, some of the sight gags were histerical and Vickie Lawrence was terrific as Sister Amnesia. I would truly recommend this DVD, especially to those who love the nunsense shows."
1,"Takes some practice It really does take some practice, but once youve got it down, you can cut like the one on the package. Thats not the hard part though. It can sometimes be very difficult to actually bread the thing and fry it, but thats not really this products fault. Either way, if you want to make a cheap blooming onion, this is the way to go."
1,"Dakes Study Bible This is an intensive, well written, Charismatic, Pentecostal oriented study Bible. Exhaustive notes, and cross references make it a good addition to a Bible students library. The only complaint I have is that the print is small for old eyes!"
1,"great purchase! Ive read half of the book, and so far I find it very interesting and an easy read. Im in the middle of grad school, and reading tons of information on brain research. This book is a breeze compared to all of that! It presents some ideas to consider about creativity, the direction our world is going, and the role our nation and children will play in that. Pink was a speaker at the Texas Music Educators Convention this past February which inspired me to order the book through Amazon rather than pay convention prices!. I BELIEVE you can go to www.tmea.org and find a link to his speech. Pink presents facts and data in an easytoread manner, and keeps the interest of the reader. He also finds that delicate balance between humor and hardcore data. Honestly, it is hard to put it down! I also gave the principal of my school a copy...it never hurts to thank an administrator for their hard work, or remind them how important your subject area is."
1,"Enjoyable and underrated Christmas movie I always had the impression that this was a runofthemill Christmas movie. Then, one night I was flipping through the channels and this movie was on. Arnold played a good part  it wasnt his best comedy role probably Kindergarten Cop in my book, but he was good. Sinbad, on the other hand, was great. Sinbad played a postal worker that wasnt all there about  cards in his deck and made the movie. There are several parts that made me laugh out loud and still do.In the end, the movie attempts to be a feelgood movie and comes close. The ride getting there is worth watching the movie though. Overall, not the best Christmas movie, but definitely underrated and worth watching."
1,"The hardest part is to stop listening.... No matter what your preference in country music is, it is here in Alisons latest gem. She runs the gamut from straightahead country to rockinfluenced flavors that would give the Pretenders a run for their money. She is the most prolific country writer and singer on the music scene today genuine, insightful, and emotional. Many artists today are categorized as either commercial or noncommercial. She is the rare example of both, and this wonderful CD displays her talents at the pinnacle."
1,"GC just keeps getting better This is an awesome CD following Good Charlottes other great CD, their selftitled debut. GC is the best band out there and everyone should know this. Anyone who likes punk should definitely buy this CD. I would reccomend buying GCs debut album, and anything else, including their DVD coming out next year!!!"
1,"The best headset Ive used The Samsung WEP is the best sound quality on both ends of any headset I have used. I had  different Motorola sets and the sound was not loud enough on my end and I was told I sounded like I was in a tunnel. This unit is comfortable and when driving, stays put even without the ear loop. The ear loop is another story. I started using the loop for when I was walking and driving with the window down. The loop broke within  weeks. Very flimsy. I ordered some more of a beefier style from Samsung and hopefully they will last awhile longer. The replacement loops were only  each so not a significant added expense. For the price, this unit is very very good."
1,"Telling it Like it is This is one of the most complete, evenhanded and fairminded history of th Century Black leadership that has been produced. It is not a work of original scholarship but a very scholarly synthesis of all of the literature combined with judicious analysis. There is a major thesis that Black leadership has been largely the product of a middle class elite that has invariably short changed the black masses. Nelson pulls no punches, he can be wonderfully acerbic in his criticism but always fair and balanced. I know of no work that is as comprehensive and useful. It is perfect for courses in contemporary African American history. It will also be of interest to scholars in the field, because of its rich interpretive and analytical qualities. I highly recommend this book"
1,"good product at a good price I already knew about the quality of these Sharpies when I bought them in a fine arts store. Amazon offered them at a great price. I do like the smaller nib better, however, but they werent available. Maybe soon, hopefully?"
1,"Love it or Hate it! This book seems to engender very strong reactions from readers, and thats all to the good. The reactions seem to even vary story by story. A recent New York Times Sunday book review used rather strong language in essentially panning several of the first stories in the book, and then turned around and praised the last story, I think that the only explanation is the stories touch on dark and hidden emotions buried within all of us, and that some readers can not deal with what it awakens within themselves. To me, that is evidence of the power of this book, that with spare dialogue and in the limited span of eight or fifteen pages of a short story, Cavell not only keep us more than interested. He can scare and thrill and stimulate our deepest primordial impulses. All in all, I couldnt put it down until I read it through."
1,"Feeling Good  The new Mood Therapy This is a self help book that teaches you to change the way you think. I am using the book in conjunction with actual therapy, in fact my therapist recommended it. I intend to read the book, and practice what its teaching. Then follow up regularly. So far everything said in the book makes sense to me. I will have to get further along before I can say if it actually helps, but I believe that it will."
1,Deal or No Deal This game is great!! You can have  people playing this game at the same time Taking turns mind you and the sounds are just like on the TV game show. It keeps track of the amounts and the offers.
1,"Thankful for the Help Sherries book was just what I needed. After turning  I felt a need to fix up my look. While the pictures were wonderful examples of what to wear and how to maintain an updated and appropriate look, the text has really helped me when shopping. I am so excited about my new wardrobe and have a new found confidence in my appearance. Thank you Sherrie!"
1,"A Southern Confession Lillian Smiths book is amazing considering that it was written in  well before the Civil Rights era and before African American voices were heard by the white community. She starts by telling us the problems children had in separating what they were taught at home and at church with the reality of segregation in which all black people were considered inferior to them. God created us equal but not too equal. I am a Californian who has lived in the South for  years I have been trying all that time to understand the Southern perspective and have found this book to be a real help in understanding a part of our country who. we know, suffered in a way the North never suffered after the Civil War and into the th Century,but still could never admit they were wrong about the war or that slavery and later segregation was evil."
1,The most intriguing and challenging word game! This is the best word game I have ever played. Its strategy combines the best aspects of Scrabble and of poker. It is much more challenging and engaging than Scrabble. I would recommend this game highly to all.
1,"Exremely pleased Everytime Ive purchased any Canon ink cartridge, and Ive purchased well over a hundred bargain brands and Canons, Ive been extremely pleased witho no clogging,o quality print,o page count per cartridge printing,o every cartridge printing when installedThe only negative would be their high pricing, but I guess it proves the old axiom you get what you pay for."
1,Wonderful book turned movie This is a wonderful book! I really loved the pace of the story and how endearing the characters were. This book was turned into a television movie called The Beniker Gang starring Andrew McCarthy. FANTASTIC film. It was very true to the book and wonderfully acted! I recommend both the book and the movie!!
1,"Great for my speedloaders Nice case for my HKS speedloaders, I use  HKS speedloaders and they fit perfectly in these cases. I recommend them if you need a speedloader case, cant say for other brands besides HKS but, it seems that it has enough room to fit other brands of speedlaoders."
1,"helpful many may find this stupid for me to say this but i will say it anyways... my dog just died. we had to put her to sleep. My friend Megan told me about this book and i read it off of the internet somewhere. i was so moved by how he can speak about death and w such beatiful words. its nice to know that when i feel sad and miss my dear gege, i can read that book and feel better again. ..."
1,"An Excellent Resource by a Noted Expert Ann Wallace is nationally recognized as an expert on fabrics and textiles of the American Arts and Crafts Movement. She has developed her knowledge both through academic and practical experience.This book reflects her experience and knowledge. It is a must have book for anyone interested in the history of the Craftsman Movement in the U.S., and especially for anyone who is acquiring or collecting textiles from the period, or contemporary work done in the Craftsman Style."
1,"The naked killer This is one of the best animes ever made. Im speaking for the entire series. The idea that a normal man can be brainwashed into becoming the perfect assassin is a brilliant idea and the fact that he cries every time he kills as a release is what makes this anime so great. Much of the time, Freeman is naked but you dont see any of his important parts due to shadows and this huge tattoo that covers his body. There are sex scenes in the first movie that are highly erotic so its not something you want the kids to watch. But for adults this series gets an A rating."
1,Old Kingston DDR Ram The RAM was just what I needed for an older system I was rebuilding for someone else. I see them all the time and it has been running just great. No complaints from them or me on this. Usually Kingston memory can be trusted for whatever you need in your PC. Lifetime Kingston is all that I use right now and this was definitely Kingston ram. I will also buy from this vendor again as well.
1,"More OC! I liked this show, but it is completely different from the others. Worth the watch though, because although they cancelled the show, they did a good job wrapping it up at the final episode."
1,"Mavala WORKS! Dont waste your time using the other nailbiting products, just buy this one and youll be satisfied. Its a few dollars more than the other brands, but works much better. Brush it on like a clear nail polish, and any urge to bite nails or suck thumbs will be gone a few seconds into the actthe stuff does NOT taste good at all! Our kindergartner has had the nervous habit of sucking her thumb. We tried everything from punishment to positive reinforcement, but nothing worked longterm, and certainly not if we werent there to catch her in the act. Once we applied Mavala, the bitter taste kept her from doing it again. The product doesnt easily wash off, so it works even while shes at school or with friends. I highly recommend this product....and buy it before wasting time and money on the competition. Youlll save yourself a few bucks and tons of frustration."
1,"It scared the  out of me!!! This movie definitely was similar to Blair Witch because it had the same intensity. The mystery and freakyness made it hard to look away but the suspence made you want to dive to the floor. If it had a Resevoir Dogs ending, it would have been an easy  stars. A must see!!!!"
1,"Im Sold! Many friends have often encouraged me to take a listen to Dave Matthews. . .and I am sold! He has a unique upbeat bluesy sound with depth.My picks for this CD...although I praise the entire collection include DODO, OH, GRAVEDIGGER, and UP AND AWAY.I recommend to friends to purchase, and I am now a fan!"
1,"simple. great acting  powerful story  good movie To be honest, I didnt think much of Theron she always seemed to be just a pretty face in Italian Job etc, but this performance completely blew me away. Her transformation into Wuornos both physically, the makeup is crazy, and emotionally is completely believable without seeming like over acting or fake.But be warned, this movie does not hold back. Admittedly, the violence is appropriate, and the movie would not have the powerful effect it does without it, but if this sort of thing makes you uncomfortable then youd be best to avoid it.If a good story interests you more though, then by all means buyrent it."
1,"scooter My  year old daughter has been saving for this for the past six months so we paid for half for her birthday. she has ridden it everyday since and loves it. The battery lasts long enough for her to use it all day she doesnt ride it continuously for  min but off and on throughout the day. It goes fast enough for her, she doesnt go full throttle anyway. She should be able to ride this for a couple of years."
1,"Cozy and warm enough for a Minnesota winter Our baby was born in December and we used the infant Bundleme from December until April, and it was a lifesaver in freezing Minnesota. Hes now  months old and the infant version is too small, so we bought the toddler one for this winter. Its a different material than the infant sack, more velvety than woolly. It fits perfectly in my Uppababy Vista stroller and keeps him nice and warm up to his neck, unless he sticks his arms out. Its a bit of work to put this on the stroller and take it off every time you go out, so I just leave it on always and flip down the top part when were indoors. The downside, though, is that since the material is really warm he gets heated just by sitting on the bottom half when were indoors for a while."
1,"Well worth it I have to say, between working in a babies department and now shopping for my own daughter, that Carters is a bit pricier than a lot of other sheets out there. Dont be fooled by the others lower prices  this is worth it!!!A lot of people bought me fitted sheets for my crib  and carters are my favorite! The cheaper sheets just dont fit the bed as well as these. Some have elastic all the way around, making it hard to both get on the crib and fold neatly. None of them are nearly as soft as Carters  not even after a few washings. Id have to say Pay the extra couple of dollars  in the long run, the sheets last longer, and its well worth every penny for your child to have a comfortable place to sleep."
1,"Sadly Overlooked I cant believe how overlooked and forgotten this movie has been. This is epic cinema at its finest.This movie is just beautiful. Every scene is woven together seamlessly and perfectly. Jewel is spectacular in her debut and Tobey Macquire shines in a role that is acted as well as his role in The Cider House Rules. Every actor shows perfection in their roles.In a refreshing change we see the Civil War fought between,not strangers,but between neighbors and former friends. Also,it is rare that we see the Civil War from the southern point of view,which is just what we get here.To sum up this movie only takes one word...Spectacular!"
1,"Ethereal yet emotional soundscapes! I bought this album one year ago, i didnt knew what to expect from Hammock this time, but wow, they went beyond my expectations! Each single song of this album creates a different world inside your mind. The entire album its like music made from your strangest dreams... through a glass darkly tells you the story of the deepest, saddest and most melancholic dream ever. The first time i heard it, it made me cry, i promise im not exagerating. You may emerge from this more dead than alive its like the memory of a daydreaming experience. Like if youre awakening. People, to be honest... this album totally worths each penny!"
1,"Noticable Difference I have noticed a decrease in the amount of joint pain since I began using this product. The glucosamine seemed to have stopped working so I was in need of a replacement. I found this product through an article in Natural News that spoke of its benefits. So far I am pleased, and at the huge cost reduction its a win win!"
1,"fantastic i saw this film many years ago, the things i could remember sammy davis jr.  dean martin  burt reynolds  hot cars!then i bought the film on vhs years ago, and it was as funny as years before.now i cant find my vhs so i buy the film on dvd because i think nowadays nobody can make such a film with so much stars and humor again!!i love it!!!"
1,"Robin Hood fans take note I have been looking for this movie for years nobody believed me when I told them Disney had done a live action Robin Hood movie long before his cartoon version. Well, here it is you sceptics! This has the archery contest Robin won, several of his more famous Merry Men and how they came to join him andof course, its Disneysongs. The singing is done by Allen A Dale, naturally. This is a good Disney story and well worth the purchase, to say nothing of the viewing."
1,"Wife loves it!!! My wife wanted a duck thermometer for the pool. I thought this one was cute and not very expensive. We live in Florida where the water temp is usually very nice, so, it is more for my wifes enjoyment. It makes her smile! The delivery was slow."
1,"Ana Clara This is one of the first Tamora Pierce books I have ever read, and one of the best. It shows how women are just as equal as men, and that we should always try to reach our goals, no matter how hard it can be.I really recommend it to young girls and boys, since among other things it is a great fantasy book."
1,"No problems I just bought this unit today, USED, at a pawn shop. We all know what that means someone in my town, GIs, uses a unit to death then dumps it on the pawn shop. Well, all I can is that for the way, way, less than retail I paid for this thing, I am very happy. All I wanted it for was something to play MP discs for my stereo I already own a good DVD player, so the fact that this unit can do that too is moot. This bargain player does everything it was supposed to very well.I have, however, tested this thing for DVD playback and its just fine. There is little or no motor noise and the videosound quality is terrific, even compared to more expensive DVD players Ive seen.The small size is a plus, too. The unit is a little taller than normal, but only about half the width and  the depth of most other DVD players.My advice is that if you want a really good, inexpensive DVD player, buy this unit new or do your best to find a used one somewhere."
1,"For people who cant sing, but love to sing. I just love to sing and think I am good until I record my voice and then the truth comes out. But when I am alone, I say to hell with it and belt out the whole record. I just discovered these records and I am  years old and will definitly order more. It will probably extend my life another  years"
1,"People that buy Stumps CDs  then complain are idiots. Of course theyre all non stop s style shredding from start to finish.Calling Stump an Yngwie clone is inaccurate, silly,  shows a serious lack of knowledge of the genre. If Stump is ripping from anyone its Blackmore, not Yngwie. Ive been playing for over  years  have been a shred junkie since the early s. Im well versed in Yngwie  all the other usual suspects of the shredneoclassical gengres. Stump has his own sound  style that is waaay more blues based than anything Yngwie does. If you like shred youll love this CD. It rocks from the first track to the last, not a bad song in the bunch. Youre tone deaf if you cant hear the emotion  passion in Stumps playing!"
1,"Very pretty flower girl dress!!! This is an excellent dress!!! Very pretty on all the girls in my wedding!!! A little longer in length than shown on site, but it is exactly the perfect dress for any flower girl!!!"
1,"Dreamin Out loud, Is The Third best cd Trace Adkins has put out it has a lot of good songs on it like, I Lest Something Turned On At home, Dreamin ou Loud, This Aint  No Thinkin Thing,  the other one that starts with numbers at the title. This is a very good cd.if You Liked this cd Check Out his others. Songs About Me. Greatest hits Vol. . Comin On Strong. Chrome. More. Big Time"
1,"Nice Very nice polo, good material and everything, but beware  it runs big. I bought it Size XL and it fits more like a  or X. So I would suggest if you buy this item, buy it a size smaller than you normally would."
1,"A diary of Joe Namaths first year with the Jets  Bob Curran did history a favor by writing this chronicle of the  New York Jets, which was the rookie season for their future superstar, Joe Namath.Detailed playbyplay descriptions are given of every game, and the book touches on Jets personalities such as Wahoo McDaniel and Don Maynard. The saga of the teams touchy threeway quarterback situation that year, with Mike Taliaferro trying to fend off rookies Namath and Heisman winner John Huarte, is also reviewed.Its interesting to see how the club was slowly bringing the pieces together of a team that, three years later, would shock the American sporting world by beating the NFLs Colts in Super Bowl III.In summary, a great time capsule of the American Football Leagues middleyears. Overall its pretty well written and enjoyable if youre a fan of that era."

1,"Invaluable Resource The suggestions for restaurants and BBs were superb e.g., without the book in hand, we never would have come upon The Little Skillet in Kinsale. We spent a delightful evening in this charming restaurant that seats fewer than . The entire side trip to the little towns of Kinsale and Cobh was unplanned and quite memorable and suggested by the book. This was my first trip to Ireland and my husbands sixth. He was pleasantly surprised to be seeing and doing things he hadnt before. The many easytoread maps were useful. We happily handed over the book to a young couple from California we met in the Temple Bar in Dublin the final night of our trip."
1,"Complete scale drawings except details Who wouldve thought this famous architect would be living in a converted concrete block warehouse? It is a complete but nontechnical photo essay with the obligitory highbrow analysis. We dont know what the roof is made of, for example, or how the house was constructed, or where he got those steel casement windows. We do know he just saw a For Sale sign while walking through this neighborhood one day, and now its his personal museum, full of his collected artifacts, which he hopes to turn over to a foundation someday. His inimitable style is everywhere, and makes for pleasant page turning.Most of the pics are of the interior and are in BW. However floor plans and elevations appear at the end."
1,"Awesome Movie I saw the trailer for Joy Ride, and I decided it looked cool, at least good enough to see. It was, however, much more entertaining than I thought I thoroughly enjoyed it.One thing that really adds to the movie that you arent expecting going in is that it is actually a very funny movie, one of the funniest movies I saw last year, easily the funniest noncomedy I saw assuming you dont count Rush Hour .The suspense and action scenes are very good, and the bad guys voice is the creepiest Ive heard in awhile. This is a great movie with an awesome finish that I highly reccomend to anyone."
1,"Good Shoes These shoes are not handsome, but they are functional. I require a thin plastic shoe insert to correct a biomechanical problem, and these shoes have room for that. I walk frequently in these shoes over rough and rocky terrain, and they have a good blend between the stiffness to keep from sliding off a rock to the flexibility to adapt to the terrain. I also like the solid lacing through the tongue of the shoe, which helps to prevent loose shoelaces or loosening. I was impressed with Dunhams wide range of sizes. My foot is long and narrow  a AA  and I have an unusual forefoot angulation. The Dunham last and large toe box does a good job of accommodating my foot. I previously wore a similar but much more handsome shoe, the Ecco Cross in size  Euro. Ecco no longer makes this shoe or I would have purchased that again. Too bad. But I am pleased to have found the Dunham Oxford."
1,"LowePro MX Better Case for S, S I highly recommend the Lowepro MX case. It is padded nicely, fits the Canon S or S snugly, attaches to your belt, has a removable shoulder strap, and enough room for  extra memory card. I dont work for Canon, I dont work for LowePro or Ritz Camera, but I think the MX is a better overall case for the . I spent on it at Ritz Camera."
1,"Koontz proves that he is the most talented writer out there I like Dean Koontz mopre than Stephen King. Why? Koontz simply has a better style of writing. Instead of trying to shock, like King does, Koontz has a whimsical, likable, unpretentious style  rarely a curse word. Yet his books are scary. The Bad Place is wonderful, one of the accomplished authors best, a tourdeforce with realistically drawn characters and believable dialogue. And while I was a little dissapointed by the revelation at the end, the climax was unmeasurably exciting. If youve never read a Koontz book before, this is a good one to start with."
1,Stephen King Rocks and I cant wait to see this in a movie and on TV The Dark Tower series is one of the best series of books out there on the planet today. I will be very happy to see how they do the movies along with the TV series since it would take all of that to properly show the stories written here. The books are great and I am sure you will like them too.
1,"Careful  these are sold in volumes I was disappointed because I did not do enough research and there was no indication that this is part of a series with volumes during the purchasing process. I really thought I was buying Narrative and Dramatic Sources of Shakespeare encompassing all of his work. What I got was Volume VIII, which were the romances of Cymbeline, The Winters Tale, and The Tempest. These are great and the book is great, but I thought I was getting a lot more."
1,"I have scratches too I have scratches too on my disks  of them. So far no problem in playback, but I have not watched through them all yet...As for quality the Mini Series does look bad. It looks like a composite blow up of the SD original. The episodes look good, A great deal better that crappy Cable!!!!! and better than SDDVD. The HD sound is great!!, and yes goes out of sync on Disk . There is a shot with SB is in her viper that is not even close, but then comes right back into Sync aboard the Galactica. So this is a production problem, i am surprised they did not QC this better!I hope I do not have any playback problems, and they should deliver in better packaging.I hope they fix this before Season  comes out and Where is RAZOR in HD?"
1,"Better than Britax I purchased this car seat for my now  month old daughter when she was  months old. I recently had surgery on my hand, and love the fact that I can hook her and tighten the straps with one hand. I have used the Britax and was not happy with that car seat. Triumph car seat is cheaper than the Britax and much better!"
1,"Best Turkey Ever I bought one this year for Thanksgiving. I was a little nervous about the sturdiness of the product after unpacking it. Once I assembled it easy I was pleasantly surprised. It is sturdy and I wasnt worried about it tipping over. It comes with everything you need except the propane tank. The picture doesnt show the regulator and hose but its included. The burner is strong and heats the oil to temp in about  min. The large pot looks too samll to fit a large turkey but we fit a lb turkey with room for more. the booklet lists lbs as the limit It only took min to cook and used somewhere around  gallons of peanut oil. We bought the gal box from the local wholesale club for about  and didnt use all of it so gal is my guess. Cant wait for summer now to use this for lobster, crab legs, steamers, corn....."
1,"Itll make you dream  This CD, like all the Tunnel Trance Force CD as well, is very good. The songs are mixed well, every song fits in ... You know  Tunnel Trance Force quality  Id recommand it to anyone who likes Progressive Trance or just plain ol Trance.One thing left to do now  listen to the music and dream"
1,"Good stones! While these are very small sharpening stones they are still great stones for carrying in a bug out, hiking, or camping rig. Ultra lightweight they do the job. The covers for them snap together and may not last, but they are just the thing for touching up a fillet knife, or hunting blade."
1,"The first few steps Fully explains charts, MA, RSI, Volume, overhead resistance, Stage analysis. When to and where to place Sellstop orders, Buystop orders limits and GTC....etc. I liked his writing style, very easy to read and understand. This book doesnt cover MACD, Triangular breakout and the rest of  other things. You cant fit all that in  book. so he only cover the most important thing menthioned above."
1,sound story line and game play In  I purchased halflife an instant classic. The new version is a updated story and with great content. Hey Its nice to see barney again. Installed the  disc  min each. Having a current steam acct made the activison process go much faster. Total time was less than  hour from opening box to game play. Yes you can play the single mission without being connected to the internet just follow instructions. FYI the game looks and runs great on my  yo computer.

1,"High Quality Action Flick X Men is a good movie, a lot of action and great special effects. I had never read an X Men comic before watching this and still could easily follow the plot. Hugh Jackman is ready to explode as a MAJOR film star and he does a fantasic job playing Wolverine here. The mutant battles are easily the best scenes, with some of the dialogue straining. I wish they just could have battled each other all movie. Still there was ample action and fantastic FX. This is a great looking film on DVD and has some really cool extras like Hugh Jackmans screen test and some cool stills. The best thing about this movie is that it lays the groundwork for many sequels to come. The next proves to be even better with Wolverine seeking out vengence on the people who mutated him. Definitely buy this if youre into good action films."
1,"Wonderful This book never fails to touch me with its light, innocence and humor. It sits on my book shelf along with a short list of other books I read whenever I need to be spiritually refreshed, including the Dhammapada and The Great Path of Awakening. I recommend Surfing the Himalayas for its easy to read introduction to Buddhism and spirituality, for its whimsical spirit, but mostly for the light filling it from cover to cover. Approach this book with an open mind and you will be amazed at where it will take you."
1,"Do people really believe this stuff I highly commend Mr. Woodrow for correcting his previously held false opinions. It takes a lot of courage to admit you made a mistake and even more to publicly admit it and make amends. Amends is exactly what this book is. After having previously believed Hislops research and conclusions, even going so far as to write his own book based on them, this book serves as Woodrows complete refutation of Hislops errors done with the most generous spirit possible. Woodrow may criticize Hislops methods but he never criticizes Hislop himself. After reading the book I am left with one question, why did Woodrow, or anyone else for that matter, believe the claims Hislop made? If anyone out there still holds to the foolish belief that Catholics are really Babylonian pagans, please direct them to this book so they will stop proving themselves to be fools."
1,"IRWIN   XP ClampSpreader I have a number of the original quick grip clamps, but needed some  clamps for cabinets. The new ones are great. They are sturdier and apply much more pressure for an excellent glue joint."
1,"Great for firsttimers. This is a userfriendly camera for firsttimers which features an auto mode but you can switch to various help programs in manual mode.This is a great feature for helping photographers migrate from point and shoot to a DSLR format.Its not as robust as most cameras but then again, the next step up requires a heftier budget.The images are great  even if its only . megapixels... how much can the eye really see? Its a great camera for the money and photo quality isbetter than average. And most importantly, its the right price!!"
1,"Great, Honest Story OK. first off, this is not great liaterature. However, what it is is a great story! This is a fascinating, and dare I say, gripping look into the life of Michael Shawn Hickenbottom, also known as WWE Superstar Shawn Michaels. It is refreshing to see a star who is not overly concerned with making himself look good. On the contrary, Michaels allows us to see his life, mistakes, failings and all, without flinching. His honesty commendable.Not only do you get a decent autobiography, you get an inside look at the world of wrestling. And, believe me kids, that is one intriguing place!"
1,Terrific Graphic Novel Key word Survival. This graphic novel depicts how people would act when the world is overrun by zombies increasingly accurate as you read on. This is a well thought out book!
1,"All that I got these cards about two weeks ago, and I am really impressed with them. First off, I am glad to see some empowerment cards geared towards African Americans. I get them and put them in my purse so I can read and reflect on them. Dont hurt to affirm them as well. Get a set today and be empowered. My favorite ones are Explore Your Talents, Inquire Within, Love The Skin Your In, Enjoy the Solitude, and Do the Ds. CHeck them out."
1,"great feature My husband doesnt always have a motel room with a refrigerator, so he takes this one in from the car and plugs it into the wall. From the cigarette lighter in the car to the motel roomgreat idea. Glad we got it."
1,"Too overpowering This is an extremely well done thriller. The acting is superb. The story is fresh. Well, as fresh as a sequel can be. My only problem with the film is that they really pushed the edge with the gore in this movie. You definitely do not want your children to see this film. Some of my adult friends have had trouble with the scenes in this movie and I am sure children would have nightmares over it. I really liked the movie, but I wish they would have held back a bit."
1,"best disney movie ever The Lion King is by far the best Disney movie ever made. I first saw this movie when it first came out, when I was only young. Now I am older and I think I love it even more! It has always been my favourite movie and it always will be  it has it all. A beautiful tale about a young lion club who overcomes his fears and takes his place as King. There is never a dull moment, the story is great, the music is beautiful, the characters are unforgettable. This is a mustsee for ALL ages  a brilliant family movie."
1,"Pure Pleasure If there was ever music created that becomes one with your soul, then this is it. I feel very connected to each mood as it moves from melodic to introspective.At times you feel like an eagle soaring high above the earth. This music will lift your spirit.The trademark style of piano and Native American flute, along with voice and percussion will create a relaxing mood for you to enjoy.Perfect for playing when giving or receiving a massage. This music is also like a massage for your heart.Truly Beautiful.The Rebecca Review"
1,"Ginger is out...Geri is IN!!! I would sincerely like to congratulate Geri Halliwell For producing such a wicked album...I dont mean to compare her to the Spice Girls...But Schizophonic is way better than anything they ever did! There is such a different variation of music on there, and theres always a track for whatever mood you are in. I hate it when you buy an album, and you only like a couple of songs...but on here...you just love them all! More like this please as it too fantastic to describe..."
1,"Great Customer Service I bought these ear buds and they came with a defect however, the customer service department did a great job in replacing my item quickly.THANK YOU The sound is great. I am happy with my purchase."
1,Great portable FM transmitter with a great price! I love this product. I had searched for FM transmitters for my Ipod and couldnt find anything below . I tried  or  high priced transmitters but was disappointed with the sound quality I was getting from them  too much static interference. The GPX portable transmitter model WL really surprised me with the clarity of its transmission. I couldnt believe how good it was. I believe that it having  AAA batteries boosts its power and provides that extra oomph to give a solid sound quality. I have recommended this to my friends because of the reasonableness of the price and the portability of the unit.
1,"mesmerising I first heard her voice on a Met compilation and became intrigued enough to buy this CD.I love her voice...its so simple, unfussy and pure and yet so very unique. you know its her from the first few notes on.I love her Manon, probably more so than Sills or Fleming. Her voice reminds me of De Los Angeles, but is different.Im glad I was introduced to this great, stylish and classy singer."
1,"Great product Tool rolls offer compact, organized storage of tools in a way that all your tools are laid out before you when needed. This roll is of very high quality construction, and the included handle and tightening straps put it far above the much simpler craftsman version with its insecure laces."
1,"Cuts like butter though fabric These are a great pair of scissors, but I am not sure how long they will last. They seemed much better when I first bought themIve had them about a year and they dont seem to work as well. I would recommend them, if they can be sharpened."
1,"Does the job Hey, its worth it for the price. I surely long for the Bose QC , but that costs a lot of pretty pennies and this didnt. It blocks out enough of the airplane noise to be useful, although its not very comfortable to wear for more than a few hours. I have to let my ears breath every couple hours for comfort. Its nice at work to block out some of the chatter around me and the white noise speaker just above my desk. Until I can get a hold of some QCs, this will do."
1,"what dosent come from portland that isnt amazing?! jeff london, one of my favorite singer songwriters by far...his voice, his guitar playing, its a perfect blend of portland all wrapped up and handed to you through his music...its true, when you here him, you hardly recognize the others playing keys, cello, drums etc...he has also done work with kim norlen, and tra la la...so obvously you should check them out aswell..."
1,"The most brilliant work since Mansons Antichrist Superstar This album is angry,sad,self defeating,self boasting,verymoody and brilliant.Stan,Kim,Under The Influence,Amityville,Kill You,Who Knew and Criminal are as rewarding as they aredisturbing and infuriating to listen to.Thats what makesEminem a true artist he makes you feel like he is actuallysinging from your point of view instead of his.The music is brilliant and Eminem is the real deal.Hedefends the st ammendment and is very entertaining as wellas very disturbing and even at times irritating.A must hear."
1,"A Twisted Fairy Tale If you loved Once Upon a Time season , then you have to watch this. The stories and characters are still good and more fairy tales are being woven into the story. Wow, how intricate can this series get? If you havent seen the first season, I recommend you start from the beginning. Otherwise, you wont know what is going on, who everyone is, and how they know each other."
1,"compact and nice I like this setup because I am able to ride my bicycle miles to work and not have to worry about the effects of a long ride to work. I am able to put a size  dress shoes along with my wallet, keys,cell,and other items are needed. Now I love this product because I am able to put a starch pair of dress cloths in the bag compartments without having to fold and make unessiaray crease in my clothes. so if your a beginner this is a well built bag that I would recommed to anyone..."
1,"My Helena CamelBak I love this! It is so nice to be able to carry little items ie. camera or sunscreen or sunglasses along with my water. I think it is perfect for hiking, biking, camping, and riding my quad at the coast."
1,"Great DVD set, bad Packaging I always enjoyed the early years of the WWF and was excited to be able to own the first  years of Summerslam. After I got this as a birthday present, WWE picked the worst possible way to package these dvds! You cannot take these out without them getting scratched. They work fine, but still I would like to own it without being scratched before I watch it. So take this in mind when getting this set. But hey its the glory days of the WWF!! ITS SUMMERSLAAAAAAAAAAAAAM!!!"
1,Required Information I teach a course for a manufacturing plant for a customer and reviewed many editions of this book. Upon the review I decided this th edition covered all the information necessary in teaching as well as the best delivery of the information.
1,"Great for the beginner  helpful for the experienced! I have enjoyed this book for several years, have three daughters to whom I have given the book. I highly recommend it to anyone from the burnt pot cooker to the gourmets delight. There is a wealth of knowledge on every page. Truely the greatest book for every kitchen."
1,"Lavender Lab The Lavender Lab is cute and smells great. My daughter likes it, though I am not sure if it helps calm her down because she is so young. Time will tell. I am pleased with my purchase and have no regrets."
1,"Love, love, love this tea..... This is the best peppermint tea Ive ever tasted. Both my daughter and I love it and it is also very soothing when you have an upset tummy. Im on Subscribe and Save for just this reason...I do not want to run out."
1,Perfect camcorder for anyone especially if you wear glasses! I have had my Camcorder for  months and just love it. It is so easy to use and fun to instantly review your video with sound. This price is great and lot cheaper than department stores. People stop me wherever I go to take a look at my Camcorder and want to know where they can buy one. It is perfect for anyone who has trouble looking through the old type Camcorder and trying to squint your eyes to see. You just point and shoot with this camera!
1,Confused? My brother bought this a while back and it wasnt JUST  separate DVDs it came with a Jason Bourne American passport an extra extras DVD along with  more thing I cant quite remember it was pretty cool and I dont know whats wrong with this version of the collectors edition that people seem to be complaining about
1,"Strong, Brilliant  Intelligent Music. Was introduced to HHF with this album when I was in Australia. It is so good I just can not compare any of the other albums as good as this one, not even the latest Born. In fact Im so much into music that I was telling a friend I would love to be remembered with this album, cause I always introduce my friends with the new or rare stuff. I wonder why this never really hit it big which is good in a way cause when you hear it it just blows your mind from the begining to the end, this is it your soul being the most out standing.The lyrics are simple but strong and the music does not go over the top. Excellent piece of work!!!!!!!!!"
1,Great set. Love the shows. This was a better deal without the movies vs. the set with the movies. Purchased movies separately. If you are a fan of the shows then you need this set in your collection.
1,"Roy The Boy In another entry in this space I have reviewed Roy Orbisons In Dreams that is a more talking heads approach to his life and music. And that too has its merits. However, when we talk of Roy Orbison then the music is what we really want to deal with. And here one gets all the Roy the Boy one wants, and more. Backed by the likes of Bruce Springsteen, Elvis Costello, Tom Waits and Jackson Browne Roy goes through a litany of his greatest hits from Claudette to Pretty Woman.But wait, what about the back up singers that were mandatory to late s rock music. Well, how about k.d. Lang, Bonnie Raitt and Jennifer Warnes. Well, not bad for backup, right? That tells you exactly what you are getting here. The best. Plus a bonus, bonus in some very, very fine licks by Tbone Burnett. Outstanding here are Sweet Dreams, Baby with Springsteen on lead vocals along with Roy and the finale Pretty Woman with an incredible series of riffs by all the guitarists. Yes, Sweet Dreams Baby."
1,YOU HAVE TO READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!! These poems follow the tale of how a young women copes through life. Its gorgeous poems will imbed themselves into your very soul. The imagery will leave you with deep impressions that youll never forget. A must read for anyone!
1,"Great mix of Rock and Blues. Excellent CD! This CD rocks! You can really feel the Memphis sound. My favorites are I dont think she knows, The secret world of Charles Kuralt and All Because of You.This band has great harmony and acustisics. You can definitely hear the influences of Mellencamp and Tom Petty. Some REM influence as well, and John Hirts two blues tracks are great."
1,"Terrific! I have to say, this is my favorite CD of ALL TIME! I listen to it everyday and I never get tired of it. All of the Bee Gees songs are classics as are If I Cant Have You by Yvonne Elliman and Disco Inferno by The Tramps. Even if you arent a fan of disco, BUY THIS CD, you wont regret it and I can guarantee youll be tapping your foot to at least one or more of the songs on it."
1,"Excellent for those with too many devices Before we picked up our Xbox , we were already maxed out on the input ports of our home theatre system. This device, though, helped us piggyback our  in with our Playstation  connection with no noticeable loss of quality. It has both component and composite inputs great if you have multiple devices with more than one output type, as well as interchangeable labels for each input. Its all mechanical, so theres no power connection necessary.The one way it could have been better would have been if it included optical audio ports, but I understand that is much more complex technology and requires more expensive components. Aside from that, though, it has worked absolutely perfectly for me!"
1,"Intriguing Richard has played around with the Carpenters catalog so much almost nothing today sounds like it originally sounded. Listen to the original LP of this album and youll be surprised at the many differences in several tracks. Karen was forever redoing vocals, too Ticket to Ride, Merry Christmas Darling, Top of the World so as the years passed the Carpenters were forever reinventing their recordings. That aside, this remains one extremely enchanting album with some memorable songs, vocals, and arrangements and a venturesome attitude. Ive never understood Karen and Richard being saddled with sugarysweet, square judgments. Every album they did took a step into new territory. Imagine where theyd be today. I suspect they would have gone through a slump, then been discovered all over again. They had the goods to go on forever."
1,"The Quilting Book Its a great book, even for beginners. The directions are easy to understand, and the photographs make it more clear to understand. I am a beginner quilter, so far I have enjoyed using the book."
1,"Worked my way into SERIOUS jam! I got myself into some serious trouble trying to take the head off of my small block Chevy. I thought I would have no choice but to tap and ream it... but I saw this item... figured I would try it, and MAN was I glad I did! Worked like a charm, and saved me a few hundred bucks!"
1,Fun One year olds love to dump things out and put them back in. This is another perfect toy for them. You can name each colors shape as you put them back in. Highly reccomend this product. Great value for your money.
1,So Much Fun! I bought this years ago for a friend of mine and we had so much fun trying all the recipes and writing our comments in the margin about how we likeddisliked each one. I ordered this one now for my sister to enjoy and I cant wait to share my favorites with her. Delivery was very speedy and book was in mint condition.
1,"Fun Read! I really enjoyed this book! It was so funny, I found myself laughing outloud. I would recommend it to anyone and all of the books in this series. Some of you people just need to lighten up and enjoy this for what it isa fun read!"
1,"a good grammar book of Tagalog This is a good grammar book with straightforward explanations. Although almost  years old, I think it is still the best book on the market at the present moment. My only caveat is that the author does not know how to use the accent system of Tagalog, a suprising thing from someone teaching the language. For instance child is spelt bta whereas it should be spelt bat or bt nothing is written wala instead of wal last syllable stressed and closed by the glottal stop, etc. Also accents are not used systematically, many sentences are left without accents. Imagine a similar book about Czech, French, Spanish without their accents!"
1,"Works fine I swim for a period of time instead of counting laps and I have trouble seeing the clock. I chose this watch because it had fairly big numbers. I dont use any of the features except for the time display. Ive used it every day for about a month now and it works fine. I did use the stopwatch a few times for fun. It was easy to use. One side button to get into that mode, another one to stop and start the timer. Its a good value for .Minor gripes  the printing on the display, other than the time, is microscopic. It shows the day of the week but I literally need a magnifying glass to read it. Also the light blue is pretty ugly. If I had it to do over Id probably get the black. But at least if I accidentally leave it lying around in the locker room nobody will steal it."
1,Great gift! I bought this as a gift for a family member. We taught him how to play cribbage and I thought this board would be a great gift  the recipient was excited for the game. Its a great product. I would buy one for myself but I already have three!
1,"Wave is a great all around tool Love my Leatherman. It was hard to choose a model at first, but the Wave does the trick for solid all around use. It works for most small jobs like watches and computer parts, but it also can take a beating.I was impressed by the sharpness of the straight knife when it first came out of the box, but I feel that after a few weeks of use thats already become a little duller. I plan to have it professionally sharpened.The packaging it comes in is tough to get through, and you need a Leatherman to get through it!"
1,loved webkinz black lab My grandson is  and he and i loved playing with our black lab. He is learning so much about the computer and numbers. His eye and hand coordination is really improving too! He is also learning about money by earning webdollars. We love all the webkinz.
1,"This is great stuff Something for everyone. Really.What I liked most about this stuff is its rich harmonies and its unbelievable consistency. I had a listen to the set at a friends house thinking I could find two or three good tracks hidden amongst the rubble, but I was genuinely surprised to find two cds of really excellent, unique stuff cds  and  and  cds of high quality standards playing.And most importantly, its all different. From the odd cute little tune Straight, No Chaser to some really outstanding long explorations of some great standards, this set holds your interest and keeps it for longer than a  cd set should. Ive gotta say, Jarretts On Green Dolphin Street and  minutes Autumn Leaves are the best playings of those standards Ive ever heard. Its a real shame its so hard to find this stuff, so picking it up at a garage sale for  made my day...Definitely worth tracking down."
1,"A good selection of lougeexotica sounds made in Italy This is the first chapter of the lucky series dedicated to loungeexotica sounds made in Italy. what makes this compilation interesting is the mix of sounds,added to a typical nonsense style of this kind of music. Sounds r inspired to italian sounds scene of the s hammond organs,flutes and sax supported by the modern electronical music devices generate a good vibrations of funny but exremely interesting songs.Funny and happy like the italian s.  stars to all artistscreativity and technique. u cant be boring form this CD"
1,"Wow! Our son loves this mobile. We bought this mobile after seeing it in the store, and were very happy with it. We bought it when our son was about  weeks old, and he immediately loved it. Hes now  weeks old, and likes to lay in his crib and make noise at it. Its very stimulating for him, even if you play the Bach, which is recommended for calming them, so thats something to be aware of. Theres no way he would fall asleep watching it  as he watches it, he gets more excited.We havent had any issues with the motor or any noise concerns, and are perfectly happy with it."
1,"The best! The Freiling is great! First saw it at a Keller reataurant in Napa  even better at home. Keeps the coffee hot, easy to clean, nearly impossible to break, and looks great on the table! Worth every penny and given the number of glass carafes we use to break  pays for it self shortly !"
1,"Masterpiece, definitely ... There is no need to be a genius to realize what a great record this is, from the asskicking Smells Like Teen Spirit to the amazing Polly, you can notice how Kurt Cobain masters the art of making music. There are songs which you will keep on hearing, such as In Bloom and Lithium. So you should really buy this album. Its no waste of money."
1,"Amazing, but not what I was looking for I bought this album to explore more tracks by Hildegard after listening to one of her songs on an anthology. This music crosses centuries, languages, and religions, I feel. I am not a Christian, and the reason I listen to Georgian Chant is to study, because it focuses my thoughts exponentially. It completely drowns out the noise of the world and helps to gather my ideas. This did not get  stars because it wasnt what I was looking for. I wanted to hear tracks with a mixed gender choir but this album only goes from single malemale choir to single femalefemale choir, on alternating tracks.This is still an excellent study aid and should be recommended for use as much as pencils and pens."
1,stars is not enough!! There are women who sing anthems. This is beyond anthems and goes into another realm! If you dont get lost in the space between Kristines perfect vocals and the killer arrangements then i am afraid you are not fully alive. This cd stands out in a world of boring pop albums!! GET IT!!

1,"A great kids book I like this book because I see the influence of the French artist Roault and it fits Roault studied to be a stained glass artist,and his religious work was very powerful. This book also with the subject of Three Kings reminds me of the three wise men from the story of Christmashowever the Note from the back of the book states  A story might be based on on of the bits of lore about the Three Kings that Marco Polo put into... the narrative of the most delightful of all books of travel.. In the castle called Cala Ataperistan , only three days journey from the city of Saba.I have read that Marco Polo never made his journey and that it is a brilliant work of fiction so maybe the Three Kings were really the Three Wise men ah well ...."

So when things go wrong, in this novel they go wrong in a different way when she is caught in a lie.Still, it is fun, and a st for Mrs. Polifax fans."
1,"for San Francisco fans Excellent, nostalgic look at old time San Francisco. There are many references to specific streets and neighborhoods. Therefore, book will be best for those that are real fans and are familiar with The City by the Bay."
1,"Got A preview and loved it! I got the chance to hear P.N. Elrod herself read a small portion of Dark Sleep before it was done, and it sounds just as good as the rest! If you liked all the books before in the series, you will probably like this one as well, if not more. I shant reveal any specific info, but this book will not lack action."
1,"Grownups Can Be Sexy Too! What fabulous fun! People over  in a stylish, entertaining, and intelligent filmthats a refreshing change of pace! Two grownups playing whos got the goods? and it turns out, neither of them does. Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo are terrific in this updated version of the Steve McQueen s film about highend art theft and pursuit of the bad guy. Twists and turns and Russo in a fantastic Michael Kors wardrobe, plus Brosnan funnier and sexier than ever, make this a smart film for actual grown persons. Amazing!"
1,"Remarkable electric razor... This razor by Norelco is excellent. I have had close shaves ever since I bought this a month ago. Two of my senior leaders borrowed my razor when their electric razors broke and they remarked how good it was. The only reason this is  stars is the lack of a power meter on this model. While not perfect, I consider this to be a worthwhile investment."
1,"An outstanding survey for any basic photography collection! The revised edition of UNDERSTANDING EXPOSURE is outstanding, using the authors professional photography as examples for explaining the basics of light, shutter speed, and results. Tips on great shooting using either film or digital camera supplement photo examples and make this an outstanding survey for any basic photography collection!"
1,"The best gangster book Ive read so far Mario Puzo is my God. Bless him for he has written such an amazing book. I just got so engrossed in it. I didnt want it to end. Even though I knew what was going to happen because of the movie it was still much more interesting to read it. I thought Donnie Brasco was the best gangster novel, but this just blows it out of the water. Somebody whose never read a book in their life could easily enjoy this one. Very highly recommended to anyone whose interested in the life of an old fashioned gangster."
1,"A beautiful source of interesting problems I deeply consider that this is a very stimulating problem book that contains a variety of problems and their solutions.This book is of high interest to anyone who wishes to pursue research in elementary trigonometry and its applications. It is also excellent for students who want to enhance their skills in elementary mathematics to support their research in other fields such as geometry, algebra or mathematical analysis. Some of the problems contained in the book are also suitable for undergraduate students.I STRONGLY recommend this book to all who wish to find an excellent source of interesting and modern problems in trigonometry."
1,"Brilliant Album, get the one with extra tracks I was suggested this as Bonobos best work. I dont know if it is better than the rest, but it certainly is tops! I can listen to this over and over. Catchy beats, lush soundscapes, and good guest vocals. But the instrumental versions of those tracks are also worthwhile."
1,"Such a simple idea And it works so well! I have a set of luggage that doesnt have those attached luggage straps, so this works great for me. Sturdy. I dont think itll be coming apart any time soon."
1,"Gabriel, God, and the Fuzzy Blanket from Kokomo I just finished reading this lovely book to my son. I found it very easy to read with lots of things to peak a childs interest...the most fun was Gabriel! The illustrations were very well done and give a lot to look at. Annette Griessman has a way of describing things so that you dont need to see the illustrations to see what is going on. A great book to make a child use hisher imagination!"
1,Another Solid Heath Tome Another great EnglishTexan storyline by Heath. The only reason it didnt get  stars is because I found the Heroine to be whiny and clingy sometimes.Dont pass this one up!
1,"Well made, but NOT generous sizing This costume was very wellmade, compared to most store bought costumes. It looks authentic and detailedhowever, the sizing leans very small. I am a size  and I JUST fit into the medium. Also, I am not happy with the fact that I paid shipping for all three of the items I ordered through Amazon separately. It was very costly in the end. Next time I will most likely go to one of those cheesy Halloween stores to avoid all of the what I consider extra shipping costs."
1,"Wonderful collection The Rurouni Kenshin OVA otherwise known as Samurai X was one kickass movie, but it wouldnt have been as excellent without its beautiful soundtrack. Basically it is composed of orchestrated songs, with a couple that you will never forget. one of my favorites is Last War of The WolvesI think that if you watch the OVA itself then listen to the soundtrack, you will enjoy it more because you are able to recall the scenes in which the music was played."
1,"Great tasting snack  low in sodium and calories This is a great snack. Great texture and taste. Low in calories, low in sodium, no msg or other bad stuff. Yeah!Tastes a lot like those other cheese puffs but less salty. I love em. I buy via subscribe  save for lowest cost.Perfect, quick snack size and great taste."
1,"Saving Shiloh This Is a touching book, Shiloh was beatin by his owner.A kind hearted boy,Marty saved him. Marty saved him once can he save him again? This story will touch you heart and become one of your fave stories!! I rated this book will  stars because ,I couldnt put it down. I read chapter after chapter. It has been one of my favez and will always be!!!"
1,"A NoNonsense Simple Slip On I bought these black shoes because they are office friendly and easy to put on. They are great on both counts! My ankle has been giving me fits and my nicer hard bottom dress shoes arent going to cut it. I am able to put these on easily and without pain! The cushion isnt bad, but it could be better. But I will have to get a brown pair of these shoes!! They look almost geriatric, but they get the job done!"
1,"Very Rich and Detailed This book brings a lot to the table! I was really amazed at how much there is to read, learn and digest from this wealth of information.It has simple descriptions of materials, techniques and styles, many of them charted out to compare easily. It gives you many reasons to create a personal art journal, helping those who have problems deciding where to start, like me.It may daunt those who dont feel they have any drawing skills, as the illustrations in the pictured journals are handdrawn, however, there are many other examples that show you can take the materials around you to create interesting and intriguing layouts. It also gives simple stepbystep instructions on how to recreate certain drawings in the book.I particularly liked the section on the ways to bind books and bind existing books. That, on its own makes this book a very valuable resource!I think this is a great addition to any altered book artist or art journalist!"
1,"Alive Vitamins These are vitamins whose effect I can feel quickly.Specifically, By the th day, the normal muscle pain I feltwaking in the am was gone. There are so many ingredients here that I dont know which is helping me the most, though I suspectits the high Vit B levels."
1,"An Intriguing Tale! This, as many of McCarthys books, is an intriguing tale of good and evil and human nature. The bad guy is not likeable but has a code he lives by and considers fair. He is a killer but has to follow certain rules he has set down for himself. An easy read and I wished it had been longer. However, I felt it held my attention and was genuinely pleased I had read it."
1,"I read it in two days! Not because it was hard to put down but it was so easy to read.All conversation and a few lines here and there telling a story. Thisbook sounds like Grisham had a deadline to meet, geared for the commercial list of best sellers. But I enjoyed the quick pace. I read the book more out of my curiosity as to how things would unravel. I loved the ending!! Had to be that way. Everything else just worked out too smoothly for Lanigan. I dont care about a sequel because I know how it will end."
1,"Spreading our Empathy Masson is doing important work here. Those that accuse him of sentimentalism or anthropomorphism dont understand the project. All Masson is trying to do is generate a little consistancy between our feeling towards the animals in homes and the one on our plates. Perhaps some people will read this book and decide we should start eating dogs and cats. However, Masson rightly expects that most people would sooner pull all animals off the menu."
1,UK Harry Potter This is not really a review. Its just to tell Americans that Harry Potter and the Philosophers stone which was changed to Sorcerers Stone for Americans to understandis coming out  weeks before the US in the UK because JK Rowling wants it to and that Harry is British!
1,"Overall Excellent Topper!! Even with All the great reviews, I was still slightly sceptical purchasing. I have made the mistake in the past of purchasing cheap  memory foam only to be quickly disappointed. This is certainly not the case with this item. Very pleased with the purchase. The foam is good quality and although it has only been  weeks of use, it only seems to be getting better and more comfortable every night.Only  stars for a couple reasons First of all,  stars has to be absolutely spectacular which is a very difficult achievement otherwise the only real complaint is a minty smell that is slightly overpowering. I dont mind the smell and my girlfriend who hates the smell of mint doesnt even mind it much. BUT it should be known for anyone interested in purchasing."
1,"Against all odds Im a Jack Higgins fan, so Im inclined to be supportive, BUT, this character strains belief to the limit....with actions bordering on superhuman and a villainous depiction of friends and lovers, you end up saying unbelievable."
1,"Great little set of speakers I just wanted something that I could plug my iPod Shuffle into soI could listen to music while working in the garage. Dont likebeing attached to those earphones all the time.Anyway, for the money, this little box cant be beat in my opinion.Runs on AC or battery. Does just what it says it does.Comes with a small pouch and the audio cable to connect directlyto the iPod."
1,"For smokers, too This type of recovery from addictions is gaining recognition, even in courts of law where a person that overdrinks is normally required to go to AA. Im a smoker and just substitute smoking in the place of the alcohol advice thru much of the book. Im still learning to recognize my Addictive Voice, but feel that anyone serious enough to quit ANY addiction should read this book. I was amazed at the concepts and definitions that Dr. Trimpey explained as to whats a disease, addiction, habit! His concept is so simple, I dont know why its not as well known as AA! I thought I would be in for a lot of psychological babble, but not so. Simply informative and easier than a New Years resolution."
1,"Dark and Addicting Definitly darker than the first in this series, this book deals a lot with prejudice and hatred in Lilys community. I felt myself really getting upset with the ignorance of the people, and demanding justice, which really shows how much this book affected me! My only complaint about the book, however, is the romance that had just begun with LilyMarshall in the first was almost immediatly wrote off and sounded very uncharacteristic of Marshall. I think it could have been written better and unraveled over time more, it was pretty abrupt. I highly recommend this series, though!"
1,"A Tasteful Toast! ! ! A Tasteful Toast to Ms. Carpenter, for her dedication to music. The Hits album was long overdue but came at a good time. For songs that people fell in love with such as , miles and were unable to get, she sticks on a great CD. Her lyrics speak to us all touching us in our own way.A toast to her in prayer that shell be in this business for a long time. I believe she will."
1,"Light on detail but useful  a good companion book If you are looking for a really thorough book, this isnt it, but many of the tips are very helpful. Read it with a highlighter and just mark the good stuff and then refer back. I bought this along with Woodsons Build Your Dream Home for Less and found that the two together were a great pair. Woodsons is very thorough and takes you through step by step, and Irwins had a lot of additional tips that Woodsons didnt. Irwin tends not to define many of the trade terms he uses and for people who arent handy, its frustrating. On the other hand, Woodson does define most terms so if you read both, youre in pretty good shape. This book is not the beall, endall book but definitely worth buying  it should save you some money if you are general contracting your home."
1,"A ALL AROUND GOOD MOVIE CROSSROADS, featuring mega pop star, Britney Spears was actually a good movie. Altough many people were saying she couldnt act, she actually showed that she could. Now shes not the worlds greatest, but they all start out that way. She also gets help from her fellow costars. The movie itself is an all around good film,that many girls can relate to. Its fun, and anybody can watch it. Now, if all you males out there arent for that kind of stuff, you still have Britney Spears, too watch and drewl over, and  other good looking chicks.So check it out."
1,"Awsome! i just recently bought my ds. i was, obiously excited but a bigger suprise awaited me. my neighbor also got one for christmas. i knew that we could do picto chat but i didnt know we could do it from my bedroom to hers! its so much fun because i can sit on my bed and send her messages! our houses are pretty far apart too! i would definatley reccomend this because it is a fun system with awsome graphics and fun games."
1,"Would benefit with pictures. Love this bread recipe book. Not only does it have the recipes for sooooo many breads, it also has an extensive first chapter on grains and tricks or facts that are very useful."
1,Great replacement handle After both of my handles broke on my  Chevy  K I ordered these and couldnt be happier. It took me about  minutes to install these each side. The hardest part is removing the door panels but if you are careful its pretty easy. I would recommend picking up a cheap pop rivet gun and replacing the rivet you drill out to remove the handle with another rivet. If you replace it with a screw theres a possibility it will come loose. These handles are upgraded from the OEM handles and have a much sturdier feel and matched the gray interior perfectly. All around great product at a great price.
1,"A Great Deal The Invicta quartz Pro Diver is a beautiful stainless steel watch with a Swiss movement. Over the past month, mine has gained exactly one secondso Im also pleased with its accuracy. On the downside, its stainless steel bracelet was likely sized for a pound NFL lineman. So new owners will likely need to remove multiple links for a proper fit. Unfortunately, the extensive owners manual is silent about bracelet adjustments. So owners will need to invest in an adjusting tool available onlineor make the trip to a jeweler for a professional adjustment. However, given the quality and price of this watch, I consider that to be a minor inconvenience."
1,"Its a good album, not a classic! I like this album, but I just wished that it had a few more tracks! Im not a big fan of Kayne West, but he didnt get on my nerves like he usually does with he is involed on a track or album with another artist. I liked every song on the album excepted for the the intro. I feel that it was one of the best albums that Common has done in awhile. I wouldnt call it a classic, Common is not done yet!"
1,"Top notch quality, slightly lower quantity I really love this work, this is the way these songs were meant to be heard in the first place. I really enjoy radiohead albums, but the live stuff is really just much more vibrant and full of character. The only reason that I dont give it full marks is that it is a little short. Cds can hold well over an hour of music, yet  min cds are still released. What gives guys?"
1,"Jo Stafford performing wonderful traditional Christmas music Jo Stafford has such a beautiful voice and she does a great job performing these timeless traditional Christmas songs. If you want to hear wonderful, traditional holiday classics that will really help put you in the Christmas mood and spirit, youll want to own this CD."
1,"pretty happy! I got my Bluetooth about  months ago and use it daily. Its a great product, and I dont usually have any difficulty with volume. My only complaint would be that the earpiece could be a bit tighter  it would be nice if it felt more clamped down on my ear. Regardless of that, I highly recommend this product!"
1,"Books Books Books Wonderful book, delivered on time and no bends scratches or tears at all. One of the best lesbian fiction stories there are out there. Good to buy someone who is discovering who they are, help them get over that hump. Thank you!"
1,An inexpensive way to purchase GOOD colored pencils for classroom use These pencils are encased in a sturdy box with dividers between each color. The pencils are the same high quality pencils that the smaller packs have. A bonus is the pencil sharpeners that come with this pack. I would highly recommend this pack for any educator or even a group of parents who want to divide these and dramatically reduce the cost of their school supplies while still providing high quality materials to their children.
1,"Funny, funny stuff!! Love the Office, been a fan since the start. Usually they have a rough time the first couple of episodes, but with this being the last season, they seemed to have jumped into their stride a lot sooner. Funny, funny stuff. They threw in some old time humor for us  gave a Michael joke, which was great. Love that they threw in some awkarwdness for Jim  Pam, I mean thats what they thrive on! Andy is delicously dim, and what a nice curve the new guys in the office seem to be. I really look forward to the rest of the season!!"
1,"Excellent bio and story of modern archeology Zahi Hawass is wellknown to anyone interested in Egyptology... aside from his duties with the Egyptian government he has also been seen in many programs which have aired on cable TV about recent Egyptian discoveries. Currently, he has his own reality show about archeology. But who is Zahi Hawass?Mr. Hawass recounts how he got involved in archeology and in doing so discusses some of the archeological digs and projects hes been on. Illustrated with photographs, Secrets From the Sand looks at several sites where recent digs have revised our understanding of ancient Egypt and Hawass also looks at issues such as conservation vs. tourism a big deal in Egypt. In this book you really get a feel for why the rediscovery of Egypts past is so important to him. You dont have to be an egyptologist to like this book... its just that good."
1,"the fog of war This is an excellent short series from HBO with a terrific cast. A couple of the guys play either themselves or a fictional Marine which speaks well of the general accuracy of the piece. The brutality of war, the confusion of this particular war the invasion of Iraq, the brotherhood of men in combat  all are well depicted and depicted pretty much without rosecolored glasses. These are Marines, not shiny perfect heroes. I recommend this series very highly."
1,great insoles I have back pain as a result of spinal fusion as well as pain in my right leg. These insoles have greatly reduced both to the point that I can do much more than I could before purchasing them. To me they are worth every cent I paid for them.
1,"Love this stoller I searched long and hard for a light weight stroller that didnt take up a lot of space in my car. I did not want to sacrifice some of the features that you lose with an umbrella stoller basket, comfort, recline etc. This stoller does all this and more. Once you get the hang of folding and opening it is a breeze. It doesnt take up much more space than an umbrella stroller. It has a handle when folded to carry which is real convenient. It is light and maneuvers well. The wheels are a little bigger than an umbrella stroller so it is a little smoother. I havent been in a store so I cannot provide any feedback on tight spaces. It was also very easy to assemble just need to attach the basket and wheels. The seat is also a little higher than other strollers. My daughter likes this feature! I had a hard time picking a color because they are all nice. I ended up with the green. At first I had a hard time with the price but it is definitely worth it."
1,"Pure magic I love all of Susan Trotts work, and this is my favorite. She creates wonderful worlds in which her females characters live. Her characters have a strength and independence that are unparalleled. You can tell that she loves and understands running and women. I instantly bonded with the characters and entered into their story. This book is perfect for any woman who cherishes life, love, and human nature."
1,Love These Games Always love a good point and click adventure. The Myst trilogy offers beautiful graphics while challenging you to decipher some of the hardest puzzles. Cant wait to continue with URU.
1,"SUPERB Rendering of the Silver Surfer Character! Having read the first series of Silver Surfer comics, published by Marvel from , then picking up the series again in the late s through the early s, I have to say that its great that the Surfer is finally getting the bigsreeen treatment he deserves.The special effects...outstanding! The way the Surfers suit reflects his surroundings is well rendered. The character is enigmatic and has great screen presence.Dont heed the newspaper reviews for example, the Boston Globe reviewer panned this as unnecessary but of course did not mention the Surfers transition from D comics to film because he obviously never picked up the comic in his life.I DO have a question about this DVD version compared with the twodisc version both to be released on October , . What extras come with the twodisc versions?Thanks in advance for any helpful comments."
1,"Serious about Steam You are serious about steam locomotives and consider yourself knowledgeable about the various types and their strengths and weaknesses, but crave to understand the technical details in more detail. For example, you know what an injector does, but how exactly does it work? How do designers decide whether to use Walschaerts or Stephensons or Bakers valve gear? How does a superheater work and why does it increase a locomotives efficiency so dramatically? If these are the kind of questions that intrigue you, then this is the book for you.Most of the examples are taken from British locomotive engineering practice, but the principles described are generic. Unfortunately, some of the photographs are poorly rendered and the details described in the text are sometimes hard to see, but the descriptions are very detailed and precise. If the photographs had been better I would have rated this volume  stars."
1,gtmurray I just saw Powder live at Halsted Street Days and they are my new favorite band. Up Here is one of the best rock songs Ive ever heard. Anyone who says different is just not listening. Our superheros are coming. Yall get ready !!!
1,"Pleasant, but only mildly Miyazakiish Hayao Miyazakis very first fulllength movie has some moments and setpieces that are clearly Miyazakiish in retrospect, and is an exciting and always fun entry in a sturdy, audiencepleasing series. But its clearly a formula, and not a terribly demanding one."
1,lovely i love this ring my only complaint is that the metal is so soft that it bent to the point that i couldnt wear it anymore. i still wear it on a necklace and love it on occasion i can squish it onto my fingure but it took less than two months for it to be almost impossible for me to wear.
1,"Take Five... released in  this album was originally intended as an experiment using time signatures which break out the beats in a bar of music which was unorthodox for jazz at that time. This experimental album turned out one of the best known and biggest selling jazz albums of all time. Dave Brubeck on piano, Paul Desmond on alto sax, Eugen Wright on double bass and Joe Morello on drums. The venerable classic TAKE FIVE is on the album and everyone seems to have their own take and memories of that song. A jazz classic, give it a listen, you wont regret it."
1,"Lots of twists and turns an intriguing view of the future I loved this wonderfully cynical view of the future of filmmaking, and Hollywood as a whole. The characters came to life against a mild science fiction backdrop, and the story itself took lots of unusual turns. The dozens of movie references, subtle and not, have me left me wanting to rent a whole slew of old movies."
1,Fun and Effective Workout I have only been doing this workout a week and I can feel and see the results. It is not your typical boring workout dvd. If you like to dance it is very beneficial. I love it. I do it every morning. I have been following the week workout plan. I know at the end of my  weeks I will see a difference because I already do in only a week.
1,"Ludacris debut still fresh after all these years Still throw this into my cd changer once in a while and the music still feels great as it did when the cd first released. Ludacris has evolved as a muscician and as a celebrity over time, its been great to see him blossom into a classy musician, instead of your standard runofthemill rappers who dont get it."
1,"Excellent in its brief history of Physics. This book is a delight to read, if you are curious about Physics. It is especially gratifying from the perspective that it gives a brief history of the way physics has evolved since the field began. Its a great book to use when someone you know wants a more rational explanation of relativity.Joe K"
1,"We use it everyday Weve had this pepper mill for  months. We love it. The grind selection is a must for us, and you can really tell the difference between the different courseness options. Worth the extra money if you use pepper everyday."
1,Buy it for one songGet Down Make Love NIN should be known for their songs like Get Down Make Love. Its a shame that the Fragile had none like it. It is one of Trent Reznors best songs and there arent too many Industrial songs that can even touch it. So buy it if you dont have it.
1,"I love this book. Im a  year old boy who wears a lot of black and listens to death metal......and this is one of my favorite books. I oppose bigotry of all types, but since two of my relatives are gay, this is a topic that I have a firm stance in. I dont understand why the idea of two beings of the same gender in a relationship upsets people. I understand theres a religious opposition to this, but most of the homophobes I come across just say that its wrong without giving any actual reason. It perplexes and depresses me.As for the book itself, its fing adorable. If you like penguins, thats enough of a reason to buy this.And for the parents claiming that this book is harmful to children, I guarantee you that this book, along with any other inanimate object, will do a far better job of raising your kids than you ever could. Keep your backwards morals to yourselves and give your kids a chance to form their own opinions. Hypocrites."
1,The Sea I ruined my sisters lp of this collection because I played it so much and I was really happy to learn I could get it on a CD. I love it more this time around. I still wish I knew who narrates it. CD arrived in perfect condition.
1,"NOT GARLIC  just st johns wort! As mentioned in other reviews, this is the stuff that has been tested in clinical trials. Other brands may or may not work, the FDA still does not is not able to test the quality of supplements. Though the LA Times did a few years back and this was found to be good. Search for Testing St. Johns Wort LA Times and for more up to date info, Evidence supports St. Johns wort Natures Herbs, Natures Resources, Safeway Select also were potent options in that long ago test."
1,"A lot of fun and laughter I purchased Balderdash for the Christmas crowd wed be staying with. The ages were early twenties to midfifties and we all had fun. We were laughing very, very hard at times. Because the game does not require one to be knowledgeable in any particular subject or in trivia, no one has to feel like they wont do well. One can make up an answer for each round. So I would highly recommend this game of you want your group to have fun."
1,"CLUE RULZ! Clue is a riot from start to finish. Im a huge fan of the film and of the merchandise! I have everything but the lobby standee andor the video counter card of the house lighting up. If anyone out there has it, please email me!"
1,"Wish Id bought one decades ago! FINALLY purchased a stand mixer with a  piece pasta attachment kit and I am pleased. I hesitated always because of price, how much space it would take up and how to decide on the size of machine. I have a small kitchen and always talked myself out of it until my remodel. Now with more storage space I splurged and bought a big one. My only complaint WOULD have been that it may not work as well on a small batch of dough as a smaller bowl would and then I found out today I can purchase a  qt bowl and whip to use as well! Im thrilled and wish Id purchased this years ago. I used the sheet roller pasta attachment for ravioli and it was fun and not too hard. However, dont do as the instruction book says  it suggests that you roll to  or . That is way too thick for ravioli, so do roll it to the thinnest for ravioli. Downside really big and really heavy."
1,"Witty, soulful, humorous, candid, irreverent, terrific! Unbridled Joy The Verse of Joy Skilmer showcases veteran political strategist and commentator Lyn Nofzigers witty, soulful, humorous, candid, irreverent, biting, sardonic, verse that draws from his many years of firsthand observation as a political insider. Two Choices Mayhap the press will wait in vainFor Bush to say, I used cocaine.But then again he may admitI used it just a little bit.He finds it hard to hold his standWhen heckled by the media band.He says, I will not play your game,But plays it with them just the same.He finds it hard as time goest byTo duck the truth but still not lie.He has two choices One  to stallAnd learn from Clinton to stonewall.Or, two, at last the truth to bareAnd find that people just dont care.What eer his choice he must decideBefore his hides completely fried."
1,"boils water almost instantly The thing works great, it boils water in like  seconds! But the power button seems a little faulty you have to press it down far for it to turn on, and my other family members said they werent able to turn it on I dont think they pressed it far enough, although I dont think they said they pressed it hard. It says to completely empty the water after each use but holding the drain button does not seem to get all the water out so I just turn the whole machine upsidedown over the sink it weighs like lbs.As other reviews said on here, the Hotshot is not of quality like it was in past years so Im hoping the power button doesnt become a serious issue. Overall its so far so good."
1,"An all round fantastic listen This is a fantastic CD. Especially if you appreciate the movie. It has varying style of music interspersed with dialogue excerpts from the movie, which adds more to the overall feel.It is what a soundtrack CD should be. Not just music that appeared during a  second action sequence in the flick  but a soundtrack that actually takes you back to watching the film.It makes you remember the various sequences that the music appeared over."
1,"Very Pleased with Item and Service My daughter loves Jessie from Toy Story , and we were very excited to find this playset on Amazon for her birthday. She really enjoys playing with this doll and is very proud of her she is a frequent visitor to show and share at school. The sleeves of the outfits are a little difficult for my  year old to manage when changing the clothes, but otherwise the clothing is very easy to change. The doll is very poseable. She cant really ride Bullseye very well, but she CAN ride Breyer horses quite well. This seller was GREAT! He got the item out very quickly we ordered a little lastminute and sent a message letting tyhem know we were trying to get it for a birthday and they sent personal emails to us to let us know we would have it and we did. The packaging was in mint condition so we were able to wrap it in the packaging sometimes when we have bought toys from resellers we have found the packaging slightly damaged not this time!"
1,"Next best thing to a selfexplanatory Realtor! Over a year ago I borrowed this book from a friend, and read through it during the entire process of my first purchase of a house. It helped very easily to follow all that was happening, all the terminology, etc. and in some cases, to be ahead, and expect the next steps.It was so helpful, that I decided to buy it for myself this year, as were considering the sale of our place, and getting us a larger house.If youre going to buy or sell a house, you have got to read it itll be of extreme help."
1,"Totally s Rewind! I thought this would be the ultimate s video collection from one of my favorite groups! I give the collection  stars purely for the videos themselvesboy did they take me back! I was a little surprised at the uncensored and quite explicit version of Girls on Film and Chauffer. But otherwise the videos are great! I agree that the navigation is completely confusing! Took me a solid  mins to figure out what I was doing. I was also a bit peeved that I couldnt read the liner notes, as they were printed white on white. Whats up with that? Overall it was a great D reunion. Cant wait to share it with friends!"
1,"The Horror, The Horror John Sauls Second Child is the first horror book I ever read. years ago At my younger age I had trouble with some of the bigger words and darker concepts, but it was the best Saul Ive ever read and consequently the only.Poor Melissa is having problems growing up and being accepted and generallyumpsychological others. Teri comes into her life ostensibly as a friend, but Teri has problems of her own...Of everything literary branded into my mind, there will always be an image of Teris mother hanging from a secondstory window of a burning building and then doing a faceplant on the concrete below.I can thank Saul for thaterrlovely imagery. Dont doubt though, its a great book and I would submit, for starters.I have genuinely loved horror as a genre ever since Second Child. It is a worthy book and will quiver you."
1,"proud of you Maggie congrats proud of you my friend!! See you soon!For those who havent read this book, I will say that she does her research and is quite knowlegable and is earnest in all that she does this will have some great points of interest , inspiration ,challenging and a step out of the typical realm of reading! Set back and enjoy the read and pass the word along!!Norwegian John"
1,Great product.... I bought this video card to give a little longer life to my  years old office computer... It was easy to install.. no drivers needed... Installed without any problem a new Samsung LCD monitor x resolution. Also added brand new RAM memory and upgraded hard drive and ready for Windows Vista. For a total of  . a almost NEW computer.

1,"Days of Loneliness In Italy This is a remarkable novel about the abandonment of an Italian wife by her cad of a husband. The translation reads so smoothly that the reader would not be aware that the book originated in Italy. A quick read at less than  pages, The Days Of Abandonment is for anyone who suffers an unexpected rejection from a longtime lover or spouse.The novel is accurate in tracing the major depression that Olga undergoes and comes through with agonizing pain and not always with grace. But she does come through it. The universality of abandonment is the same whether the reader is in Italy or America or anywhere else."

1,"What a man leaving the barber shop smells like!! Being new to DE wet shaving, I went solely on reviews on Amazon to put together my starter kit. Every time I went looking at another shaving cream, I kept coming back to Taylor of Old Bond St Sandalwood. It just seemed like this was highly suggested in reviews everywhere, so it made sense for me to try it  and I sure am glad I listened! This shave cream is the way youre supposed to smell in a barbershop  a great musk smell! It lathers well, I didnt find myself needing to use a ton to get the desired lather for three shave passes, so to me this is a winwin. Great value, top shelf quality and a highly desirable smell that my wife loves! Thanks Taylor of Old Bond St!!"
1,"Really good book! Mallory is having a horrible time at SMS,not with the BSC, so she decides to go to boarding school. Before she leaves, she and Jessi both promise that theyll remain best friends. When she gets to Riverbend, she makes two new friends, but her roomate, Alexis, is horrible! For instance, like destroying a care paeckage that the BSC sent. P.S. The BSC and MAllory still keep in touch with Mallory often by Email. All in All , a good book."
1,"the album weve been waiting for years Finally they made it! and thanks to Emmylou to have made Linda more accessible and open even to have a new picture!. Here the sound on the most emotional songs Western Walls... derives from Emmylous last influences, but Linda contributes at her best with her incredible voice. The song list of writers is impressive. Emmylou is beautiful and stronger than ever, and some record company should bet on her and try the Bonnie Raitt miracle of some years ago. Shes credible, respectable, cool and hip enough to sing every genre of music old and new. Linda is Linda she has experimented enough in her career to deserve attention and respect. Her voice is a trademark, and in a moment of great new discoveries of the s and s she should deserve more space."
1,"Remember, Remember... I consider the Wachowsik Brothers movie adaptation to be one of my favorite films, so I figured it was only fair to buy the graphic novel. This was one of Alan Moores earlier works, and the inexperience shows a little, but its still a great story. I didnt realize how much the Wachowski Brothers had changed the story for the movie. I think they made improvements, as the story feels a bit weak. The book is also fairly short, containing a lot of dark artwork. The art is good, for the most part, but some images are confusing. Despite these gripes, its still an amazing story. Fans of the movie will be surprised, but I still recommend it."
1,"Lahaye does it again This book like the others in the Left Behind series is a cliff hanger that pulls you in at the first page and still hasnt let you go even at the end. After reading the first six, I anxiously awaited the release of this book and I was not disappointed already looking forward to the next. If you have not started the series you are missing out! This book is so far the best in a great series."
1,"THE s film with an Icon at her start . . . This is The ultimate s film. A wonderfully witty  intelligent script, superb performances, masterful direction and in glorious BW. All about a princess named Diana, in search of herself in Swinging London. Ms. Christie never makes a false move rumored to be based on Grace Kelly  offered to Shirley Maclaine and she is the beautiful orbit that this film revolves around. One of the great underappreciated films of the s. Own it  commit it to memory."
1,"Good CD Look all you haters, they are a hardworking band that writes melodic rock music. They may not be advanced or difficult, but they write good songs, that are actually pretty unique. You cant go out there and find anyboy who has the unique harmony in the two singers voice, and find me a hit that has the same chords and rhythm as this cd. Its a very ecclectic album. There are some lame radio songs like girls and boys and the anthem. But after that there are good songs. From the Ramone based sound of LIfestyles of the RIch and Famous, to the Social distortion sound of Day that i die. To THE USED screamo sound of BLoody valentine. They have an unbelievable ballad in Emotionless where they talk about a very personal thing in their dad leaving them, and the rest of a CD is a fun laid back CD to listen. Not quite as good as their first CD but still its an archive CD."
1,"A must have This book is a great resource.For anyone with an interest in pursuing a college education, or knows someone that wants to succeed in higher learner.You will want to see this. Great gift for High school Jr., even if you already in college there is loads of informationI previewed this book at store.you can Imagine my excitement atgetting it at a huge discount. I probly would have paid  if I had not found it here."
1,"This book is most eliquent, and yet so debonair The author of this book must be an absolute genius. Although I have never had the opportunity of meeting him, Scott Millers book radiates with superior knowledge and expierience. Scott obviously has compiled his entire guitar career into this single work, which is most commendable by any standard. The vast knowledge of WholeTone, Diminished, and Augmented, scales is enough to awe even the most fine tuned guitarist no pun intended. To some people that have posted on this forum, it seems, that they feel Scott Miller is simply a semieducated,  an hour guitar teacher, trying to make a buck. These calumnious views are merely the product of simple minds. Scott Miller a brilliant man, and I hope to see more ground breaking guitar curriculum coming from his direction."
1,"One word SUPERB Best pizza pan by far. And I should know, Ive had several, including one of those round stones. Great baking, nonstick and like all cast iron, should last forever. One nice thing is the lip of the pan, no more pizza sauce or cheese spills. If you need one or two this is it, youll never need another one."
1,"footes family tale i bought all three in this series which i remembered seeing years ago on tv. loved all three. they are quiet tales about a familys journey through several years in a small texas town. the acting was excellent. the daughter, played by horton footes granddaughter, has married despite the objections of her parents, one of whom is a very loving but controlling father. this guys acting is so good you just want to smack him. i suggest if you are interested get all , courtship, on valentines day, and . i just ordered convict which is another play in this orphans home cycle written by horton foote. i havent received it yet nor read the play."
1,"Man, that last scene was really goofy.. Imagine being stuck in a room with padded walls in some strange European country for  hours with songs by Morrissey and the Cure playing nonstop. This movie will invoke similar emotions. The little kids voiceover is extremely unnerving. Some people say Manos was the worst MSTied movie, but I think this one is twice as awful."
1,"A Comfort Book! During this time of uncertainty in the world around us, I quickly and happily immersed my self in the life of Good Harbor. I found myself easily drawn into the characters and the world around them. This novel addresses many important issues  friendship, love, parenthood, the environment and careers. As so many of us are realizing these days, there is much about our lives that is out of our control. However, we can control how we relate to the people and the environment closest to us. The story of Good Harbor illustrates and helps us experience the importance of accepting our lives and appreciating the world that is in our own backyard."
1,"Best Show On TV! I dont even know why anyone offended by the language on the show would have HBO,but if they bought the dvd set and werent aware of the excessive profanity and are offended by it I will buy it for  bucks from anyone willing to sell it for that price.For season three I plan on having a dvd recorder,only having the first two seasons on vhs. Deadwood is gritty and lifelike,you can almost taste the mud and smell the greasy food in E.B. Farnums dining room! The characters are very multidimensional and complex.To balance out the profanitywhich I even find excessive at times,please David Milch,get rid of that toilet mouth Trixie!there is beautiful dialogue obviously influenced from letters from that period in time.Realistic,gritty,violent,dramatic,funny,profane,eloquent,philosophic and character driven, putting the events in history in the background,instead emphasizing the people living through them,Deadwood has it all! Too bad some people cant get past the profanity to see that."

1,My favorite Garrison Keillor book I really enjoyed this book alot. Its my personal favorite book i have read by Garrison keillor that i have liked so far. Its full of good stories about men who struggle in life but end up making a difference.
1,"A Great Starting Place If youre just getting started with Autocad this is one of the two books I sincerely recommend. Use this one first. But at the same time get a copy of AutoCAD  Bible, by Ellen Finkelstein.Both books tell you how to get started, but For Dummies gives you a lot more background and a lot more information about whats going on. The Bible then takes over and with three times as many pages goes into a great deal more detail on the wealth of features that are contained in the new version of AutoCAD.For Dummies is written more as a tutorial. It is of the do this and then do that variety. The Bible is more of a reference book where you tend to look up what you want to do and get specific information.You might consider that For Dummies is the first few pages of The Bible but expanded into a full book format. The pair make an excellent companion for each other to take the beginner as far as he wants to go."
1,"Beautiful Music, Outstanding Artist This is the third album I have purchased by Kevin Kern. His music brings peace to the soul after a busy work day. His arrangements are creative and thoughtful. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a respite from the perpetual, fast paced craziness of current everyday life."
1,"Sneaks up on ya! Wow, my favorite album of the last year! The Chicago Album that never was. Great vocals, arrangements, lyrics and horns. The cuts get better and better the more you listen... a stunning achievement for Robert. Although Im not a Chicago fanatic, Robert makes good use of present and ex Chicago members. And his voice holds up well in all the different styles presented here. Hes the soul of Chicago.This CD takes me back to the days where all the guys were writing tunes for Chicago in different styles not just rockers and power ballads. The common links were always great vocals and the ever present horn section. I love EVERY cut on this CD!Instrumentalists take note It took me awhile to realize that the horn section on the first cut of the album is ALL TROMBONES. Its a beautiful thing and Im not even a bone player! Jimmy Pankow and Nick Lane must have double tracked! Nick Lane did all the excellent horn arranging.I cant recommend this CD enough!"
1,"Great Book I think this book is awesome. If youre looking for an informative guide to Floridas inshore. this is it. It really focuses on the hows and whys which will make you a better fisherman. If you want to be knowledgeable about what youre doing, buy this book."
1,"Classic JayZ album!!! JayZs first album is a definite classic. By saying this its in the same breath as Nas Illmatic, and the Notorious B.I.G.s Ready to Die and other s classics not mentioned. JayZs lyrical flow is so smooth and effortless on all of these tracks and also, this album seemed to have no commercial attempts by staying very underground and keeping the hiphop natural. When JayZ knew this album was good he meant it because on his song Hard Knock Life on Hard Konck Life Volume II he specifically stated, they didnt appreciate it until the second one came out. This meant that no one appreciated Reasonable Doubt until In My LifetimeVolume I came out all being compared to one another. JayZs best album Yes."

1,"Excellet Tool for Golf but research other options The Bushnell Rangefinder works as advertised. It is a convenient size that fits in my pocket or can be slipped into an open pocket of your golf bag. It is extremely light in weight.Some observations. It is difficult to hold the laser on a flag over  yards away. I try to aim it at someone standing on the green if available, or a sand trap that is close to the green. The scan mode is also useful, it provides continuous readouts so you can confirm your distance.. Serveral of my friends have invested in Sky Caddies that are similarly priced but work off of the satellites. They are much easier to use and the satellite is free. You can map out the course yourself or pay a few bucks and download the info."
1,"Solid Resource The various maps and historical text of this book tell about United States historical expansion. The book will help students visualize the geography of US history. This book is one in a series, which includes A Historical Atlas of the American Revolution and others."
1,"Best French Press on the Market Bodum is the best of the best when it comes to French Press coffee makers. Construction is very solid and nothing is rickety or cheap. The glass used for the press is laboratory grade, handblown glass, and is very durable, although you need to use a nonmetal spoon to stir the grounds. Although its a little more expensive, Bodum is an investment youll be glad you made. If youre going to be making more than  cup of coffee a week, Bodum is the best value youll find."
1,"Departue  but so worth it! This book could not be more timely  it takes us behind the scenes to the local and supreme court so that we TRULY understand the process the courts must go through when deciding difficult cases. Riveting charaters, wellbalacanced, thought provoking  truly a masterppiece and I applaud Mr. Pattterson for stepping outside his usual formula. This book will be talked about for years! Read it now! If you want to truly understand just went on with with presendial election  read this now!"
1,"The CD has deep spiritual inspiration Delias music is totaly awesome! When you see her perform personally, you will be changed. On this CD every song ministers in a new way. My favorite song on the recording is He Is Able which she does in English  Spanish. When Delia sings this song, you know for sure that God Is Able!"

1,"Beautiful heart earrings These are really beautiful earrings with sparkling CZs that look quite real. I was hoping they were a little bit smaller, since I have  ear piercing and wear a diamond stud in the second one, but they work. I like heart shaped jewelry and these got my attention because they are different from most heart earrings. I would buy them again."
1,"not bad for the price It is not the most precise scale out there, but a good value for the price you pay. It is lightweight and compact. Good bathroom scale if you do not want to let go of more than  bucks. So far, so good for me..."

1,"Compatibility Issues with New iPods This cable DOES NOT work with iPod Touch, or rd Generation Nano. It will play AUDIO, but WILL NOT display video. Apple has gone the route of locking out their products to only st party and rd party licensed accessories. They will not allow you the option to set TV Out unless the proper cable is used.The cable is very sturdy and is made of good quality materials. On the back of the packaging, it says WORKS WITH G AND G iPod WITH COLOR SCREEN. I give my rating based on the quality of the cable material, and price, but I cannot test out the quality of the video output since it is not compatible with my iPod Touch. In order to watch your videos on the TV with the Touch, you will now have to shell out  or so to buy Apples overpriced cables and accessories.AGAIN, NO VIDEO OUTPUT WITH THIS CABLE FOR RD GEN NANO AND IPOD TOUCH."
1,"Inspirational This book is an inspirational read if you like to run but wonder why you spend so much time doing it. The author describes enough of his life to set the stage for why he became an extreme running and he provides a inside look to why he does it.I think this is a great book for those of us trying to get in touch for our own reasons for running. When I turned the last page, I immediately got out my running gear and had one of my best runs in a while."

1,"CLAY AIKEN IS THE BEST SINGER EVER Clay Aiken most definitely deserves the fame and success he has received so far in that Clay Aiken is the most giving of all of the other Idol contestants. Clay Aiken has his own foundation which helps kids with special needs. The songs on this GREAT Christmas CD are very entertaining to me and millions of his fans, and Clay Aikens magnificent voice is so outstanding and is unlike no other. Clay Aiken is really the only Real Deal in that Clay Aiken does things musically his way, and this exciting and emotional Christmas CD proves it. Clay Aiken is extremely talented."
1,"A good read Well maybe its because Im a mother of a two year old or because I am interested in other cultures, but I really enjoyed this novel. It didnt have to have elaborate and gripping plot lines because it was simply a novel depicting two families from very different cultures who have one huge thing in common and that is that they have both adopted girls from Korea. Tyler makes a good attempt at constructing the American from the perspective of an Iranian extended family. Being the typical white bread american, I enjoy glimpsing what other cultures think of us, even though it is usually fairly unflattering. I will say that the ending seems abrupt, but when I think about it, the entire book is sort of a narrative of every day life and so there is no real climax or suitable ending that I could think of. Most of all, I am grateful to Anne Tyler for writing a book that is uplifting and thought provoking without including unnecessary explitives or erotic material."
1,"I highly recommend this book Before purchasing Subject Guide to Bible Stories, I borrowed a copy of it from a fellow church member.I found, though, that the more I used the book, the more I realized I needed my own copy.Garlands book is an easytouse, indispensable tool for Bible study, and I recommend the book to anyone interested in obtaining a wellorganized and carefully thought out guide to deepen their appreciation and understanding of the Bible."
1,"Not that easy to follow I had to keep rewinding the tape to keep up. You cannot follow the rutine by merely listening, and while in some positions, there is no way to look at the tv. Other videos make it easier to follow the workout without watching. Also, this is not an easy video for beginners. I would not recommend it as a first yoga video."

I am now in my s and still pick this book up when I am feeling like a good love story that I know I have had relation to... Anyone that isnt to ashamed to let the kid out in them should definitely read this book, and anyone that is a teen with some mom and dad issues when it comes to dating, should really read this one!"

1,"Sublime Madchester all over the way. After Sgt.Pepper, Never mind the boocks and The Queen is dead, this is the best album that reminds me of a new era. Funky basslines, psychedout guitars, JBrhythms, what more do you want ? From start till end, absolutely massive !"
1,"A wonderful story Ive never read a book by James Patterson as I prefer contemporary fiction and romance novels over other genre. However, if you enjoy books by Nicholas Sparks, Robert James Waller or Richard Paul Evans, Suzannes Diary for Nicholas is a must read for you.Some may feel that the diary portion of the book depicts the relationship between Suzanne and Matt as a fairy tale. However, as a mother who has written letters to her children sporadically as they have grown up, I felt her entries were endearing. Many would agree that if you were to write something of this manner for your child, it should be about the wonderful ways they grew up and the special times that were shared with their family.This book would be best enjoyed on a lazy Saturday or Sunday afternoon when you have the time to devote to yourself, and dont forget your tissues."
1,"Liked its approach Reading this book I felt Duranti to be less of a linguist and more of an anthropologistwhich I found to be a useful approach, giving quite a different perspective on the field than, for example, William Foleys book of similar title. Especially interesting were the sections on fieldwork methodology and ethics, a topic which I havent seen covered in other books on linguistic anthropology. However, some of the linguistic stuff could have been explained in more detail, and Duranti doesnt include as much on recent perspectives as some others."
1,"Dawn of the dead cool music Since I wrote my last review on the imported version of the soundtrack with a different album cover, I thought that Id write a review for amazon on this particular version of thissoundtrack. First off, this is NOT the Americanized versionof this soundtrack.....it is the Italian version.Thats the reason why the tracks are in Italian.My favorite tracks are Zombi. La caccia. andLa alba de morte viviente.One thing I particularly like is the fact that Zombihas timpani floor toms playing during the song.Being that Im a writer, and a drummer, I can appreciatethis. I also love the fact that La caccia has a shortbut memorable mandolin solo. dedudedudedudi.Its a fantastic piece of music.If you like unique techno jazz music buy this album."
1,"Was it all a trick? The plot of this classic book, which paved the way for all science fiction, is rather simple. A famous scientist, whose name we never learn, builds a time machine and disappears in it in front of his skeptical guests. He later returns and claims that he has just come back from the future, and then goes on to tell his story. The writing is clever and absorbing, and will keep you fully occupied for a few hours  all that it will take you to finish this superb novel."
1,"Good! This was delivered super fast and the book was in very good condition! I could tell it was used but it doesnt have any tears or ink stains or rips of any kind! Im very happy with the seller and with amazon.com, and I will most definitely be using this seller and website again very soon! Thank goodness Christmas is on its way! Happy Thanksgiving!"
1,"Three  fan for life They put it down on this album. I can listen to the album all the way through for the most part but I still skip cause I got some favorite songs like side to side dedicated to peoples like me, pussy got ya hooked how can you not like it when they got Remy Martin snappin on it, and Dancin on a Pole great song for the club or on your way to the club. And the Intro made me have to pull out my old three  and listen to them again.P.S. For all you who didnt know the beat from Pussy Got Ya Hooked is the same as the beat from Roll Wit Me by Co Ed if you heard the song before you would recognize itKeep It Pimpin Three"
1,"Good, but not fabulous. This is a book that I have reservations about recommending. The pacing was good, the humor was there although I didnt laugh out loud as much as some people, the characters were interesting if a bit onedimensional, and the plot was sufficiently twisted and surprising. I think the main problem I had was with the dialogue. Ignatiuss interactions with everyone in the book made me shiver at his horrible interpersonal skills. But then I guess thats the point. The whole thing seemed somewhat implausible to me. I think Ill reread it in a few months to see what I missed the first time."
1,"Driveway sensor The product meets the needs I bought it for. I have a  foot long driveway and like knowing when someone has walked or driven in since trees obstruct a direct view of the gate area. Satisfied customer, Al Richards"
1,"World History required reading! This is a wonderfully detailed accounting of World War I that anyone who has even the most remote interest in the subject should read. You will get a better and more complete knowledge of the causes and leadership of the war than you could have ever desired. It gives a great depiction of the strategy and tactics of the war, which I highly enjoyed. It also gives an objective account of all the decisions made. The only possible downside is the large amount of names thrown at you, which some people may like, however. All in all, a must read for anyone who likes to read."
1,"Not for stovetop usage This is a nice piece of Corningware. The color sorry, colour is lovely, and very slightly aqua instead of plain pale blue it has a nice feel it is a good size and shape. However, I was surprised to learn that it cannot be used on top of the stove! or under your ovens broiler. I thought this was one of the traditional uses of Corningware my mistake. I was a little sorry that Id sold the old blueflower white pieces at a yard sale.Having said that, this is a nice dish and Im still waiting for the other Ocean Blue pieces. Just thought everyone should know what theyre getting. Corning, please see if you can adjust and this will be a star item."
1,Village Voice was right.... I read about this album in the Village Voice and bought it online. The critical hype that abounds at this guys website is justified the songwriting is rich and challenging and the live show is punctuated by an extremely talented band. Come back to New York City!
1,What an interesting look at humans from the outside I thought this novel was so engrossing in its ability to depict the human species from a dogs perspective....so fascinating to see the relationships that were fostered over the years and the dogs part in those stories while still remaining the observant outsider. The characters are developed so subtly and beautifully. Lovely read.
1,"Sharing the Warmth of the African American Community At a time when books, music, movies and television produce many negative images of African Americans, this book is a gentle flow of warm air on the cold hard thoughts about African American people. This book is written for all people. You come away from the stories with a new appreciation of a people who are almost never portrayed in a positive light. Lisa Nichols has gathered stories that will warm your heart and inspire you to evaluate your position on certain issues. This is not the typical collection of stories which blame men or other races. These stories celebrate the African American culture with examples of love, kindness with a few miracles to dropped in. My favorite story is by Mike Jones, he gives a pure loving tribute to the multicultural aspect of this country."
1,"Good book! This was the first Needlecraft Mystery Ive read and it wont be my last. I loved it. The characters were fully realized and very interesting. The drama and mystery were intriguing. The story was just fast enough to keep it going and just slow enough to give you all the details. I like that Ms. Ferris did not spend too much time repeating clues over and over.The sleuth, Betsy, is a really sweetie. I liked her feistiness but also her thoughtful personality.There was one last thread left dangling but it didnt ruin the book for me. I think if you love mysteries you should read this. I am not a crafty person but I loved it anyway."
1,"A needed experience In Dancing Barefoot, Wheaton delivers to the geek in us all. He is not afraid to put it all out there, and I was not afraid to soak it all up. This book keeps an excellent pace and allows one to relfect upon their own life and experiences as Wil shares his. It left me laughing and wanting more."
1,"Stunningly acurate Biros account of the patient side of todays health care system was well written. I couldnt put it down. Being a Medical Technologist, I was all too aware of the effects of chemo treatments and the dire consequences. I was somewhat detached from his situation until I got closer to the end. I was moved to tears in several passages where he speaks of how all of this is affecting his wife, family and friends. I celebrate his survival as I participate in the marathon run in my area for the survivors of cancer and those who lost the fight. Congratulations, David and keep fighting!"

1,"Essential Booklet for all Painters This is a great little book, very useful indeed for anyone who already has some idea about painting and colour mixing. It is especially handy in this small hardback version."
1,"Great cd if youre young and in love...... This is a great cd if youre in love with a boyfriend or have a crush but if you think love is stupid, and dumb you wouldnt like this cd. The cd is cute and practically all the song are related to love like Hit Me Baby One more time, Email my Heart, and Crazy. I recommend this cd for ages  if youre older than  chances are you wont like it because this cd is kind of ages . If youre younger than  you wont understand what Britneys message is or if youre older you will see what I mean and the lyrics are childish. Other than that this was a good debut album for Britney Spears."
1,"Hello, Just received my CD, Cal Smith. It is everything Id hoped it would be, that wonderful and unique voice! Ive known Cal since his early days at Channel , Stockton, Ca. We knew then he was going to go on to be a great country star. Please release more of his CDs. There will never be enough of them. analemaypacbell.net"
1,"Is that a snufflufagus from Seseme Street? By far one of the funniest MSTK episodes of all time. Bad acting, bad effects, and bad aliens make a generally bad movie. Perfect for MSTK. I split my sides laughing. And after it healed, I did it again.  fans will absolutley love this one!"
1,"This shower gel and foam bath is aptly ... This shower gel and foam bath is aptly named. I couldnt really work up a lather, it was more like a rich cream. But oh, how nice that cream was! It left my skin so soft, softer than any other soap product Ive used. The foam bath was a little disappointing. I really couldnt get much of anything to bubble or foam, but it left my skin soft."
1,"Kindle review I received my Kindle for Christmas. I love it. I am planning on buying my bible on the kindle so I can fit it in my purse and carry it to church. It is going to save me lots of bookshelf space as I am an avid reader and I usually read about  books a year. The battery lasts for about one week on one charge with daily use. The choices of books, magazines and periodicals is extensive. I just wish it had a backlight."
1,"Looks good...... but get some help. I have had the product for a few days now and my nails do feel good and look fine. You cant notice unless you look really close. I had some nail issues in the past and used regular clear nail polish  I can totally tell the difference.My only concern is that its easy to chip its a softer polish and that it looks kind of bad if you arent semitalented with painting nails. So, if you want to use this and dont have any idea, get a friend to help. It will look even better."
1,"Surprisingly fun Ive never really liked Paris Hilton much, but this book is fun for me! Its really a diary to write in, not a book to read hence the name and I like writing a lot. This book actually makes me feel better about myself and Im not even a teenager. Im !. If Paris Hilton is so big, then she must be doing a few things people like. I think its okay for young girls and if I had a daughter, I would give this book to her when she turned .Ill admit I dont agree with every quote Like, If a guy dumps you, hes a loser., but its still a very good book overall."
1,"Very Pleased With This Purchase My husband and I are both so happy that I got this backpack carrier. We love to go walkinghiking through state parks and strollers arent always going to work because of the trails. We had a front carrier that we had been carrying our daughter in, but shed gotten heavy enough to hurt our backs with that carriereven though she was under the weight limit. This carrier is much easier on our backs and she loves being up so high and seeing everything. I cant tell who loves it more, my husband or our daughter! Proud papa loves carrying her around in this!"
1,"Powerhouse Vocalist The very best thing about Shemekia Copeland is her strong, powerhouse, soulful voice. Its the main reason I wanted a CD of hers. And her voice never disappoints. The Soul Truth is a good album, but it could have used some even better song choices. There were some outstanding numbers though. My favorites are Who Stole my Radio, Better Not Touch,  Something Heavy."
1,"It worked like a miracle for our dog I never write reviews but this helped our dog so much I wanted other people to know. Our  year old SheltieBeagle mix had become lethargic and only wanted to lay around, he acted like it hurt him to walk. He had a malignant tumor removed just over a year ago and we were afraid the cancer was back. We received the Cosequin DS  days ago and within just  to  days we noticed a marked improvement. Now hes back to almost  of his old self. We dont have any problem giving him the tablet, its like a treat for him. It isnt cheap but its worth every penny to have our dog back."
1,Great for basic video production We purchased this to create some video within an industrial manufacturing environment and the microphone did a great job focusing on the speaker and thus there was little background noise picked up even though there was a lot of background noise present. Well use this microphone over and over. Just one thing to keep in mind. The foam cover that goes over the microphone comes off very easily so just make sure you dont lose it.
1,"BEST BOOK EVER WRITTEN!!!!! I could not put this book down! It was scary and very suspenseful. You dont want it to end. Ten strangers are invited to a deserted island for the weekend. When they arrive they all want to know who their host is only named as Mr.Owen. Soon one by one, they begin to die."
1,"So true its scary! Pat Buchanan has always been a little too extremist for my taste, but this book isnt his rightwing opinion. This book is a compilation of facts taken from every study done on these subjects. It compares population statistics from the past and present and projects into the future to the year . Im afraid that so much of what hes pointed out is already happening. I can see it here in the Atlanta area. Soon, itll be all over the country. It would take such drastic measures to reverse what is happening, that it wont be reversed. That makes me sad for our children. They wont even know the America I grew up in. What will this great country of ours look like in ? Will we be an extension of Mexico? Will the Islamic extremists reduce us to their level? Will the Political Correctness craze turn us into pansies, like the French? Do we have the guts to do what NEEDS to be done. Frankly, I dont think so. That makes me sad, so very sad."
1,"Those in Power You Owe It to the Masses! Im an expat Canadian who fondly remembers this incredibly entertaining sitcom. How can I and all other reviewers convince those in power that they can only benefit by releasing this magnificent series on DVD? Many of the successful family sitcoms of the s havent aged well and are simply not as funny as we once remembered them. Poor sales of these released sets prove my point. Now, with Balky and Larry, were in a different ball park altogether. These are timeless episodes in the same league as the very best of the I Love Lucy series. Come on PS aficionados and lets start the ball rolling! Lets have more reviews to encourage those in power to release this unique and nevertobesurpassed series on DVD NOW! They owe it to the masses!"
1,"For people interested in Fashion Design I purchased this book on amazon.com at a very reasonable price and was very pleased with my purchase. For under  this book provided me with the information I was looking for. I recommend it to anyone, especially students interested in majoring in Fashion Design in college. This book explains the basics of what majoring in Fashion Design requires, and goes into describing the what, when, where, and why of what being a Fashion student involves. I really enjoyed reading this book and learned a lot!"
1,Not bad all in all a good book Well I was a bit annoyed that Drizzt wasnt in this book but after seeing what Wulfgar had to go through it made the book a lot more interesting. The peasent girl story was an interesting distraction from what was becoming the typical Wulfgar getting drunk and fighting. All in all it was a good book and a great addition to the collection.
1,"Excellent Artist...great collection Hey, I bought this book mainly to have his collection under one cover...Hes an excellent artist and has caught the spirit of the Civil War. Book arrived in excellent condition and well wrapped. Would recommend....thanks Amazon"
1,"Timeless novel I loved the novel East Lynne and am now reading it for the nd time. I could not put the book down and kept reading and reading. I recommended it to my mother and she also read it and loved it. It is Mrs. Henry Woods greatest triumph. The reader feels so greatly for Lady Isabel, one wishes the ending were happier for her. The deaths of little William and finally Lady Isabel bring many tears. No wonder it was such a success in the Victorian era and it should be printed again in this time, to counter so much trash and vulgarity that is written.I certainly can believe how successful it must have been when it was first printed in . I also believe anyone who reads it wishes Lady Isabel back in her exhusbands life and Barbara Hare out! Wonderful!!"
1,"This book is so passionate, so believeable, so true! This is definitely one of Michaels best! Just like in Men Cry in the Dark, he poured his heart and soul into this one! Despite the annoying grammatical errors, this one is destined for the best seller list! Michaels art of writing is truly a blessing!"
1,"EVERYONE should read this! Anyone who is in a relationship should read this book. I want to give it away as a wedding present to all my friends. I wish I would have read this long before it was too late for me. But, thanks to this book I have a great marriage now. Read it, and understand the truth within it!"
1,"Police Woman Number One This book is light and enjoyable reading. Author Gayleen Harris, a retired LAPD cop, loved her career, and her memoir is free of the bitterness and angst that marks the autobiographical stories of other current and former LAPD officers.Theres nothing shocking or revelatory within the pages of this book, but not every book needs to be groundbreaking and thought provoking, and its refreshing to hear from a retired LAPD officer that actually liked their job."
1,GREAT FOR PARENTS!! Love this sound machine because it keeps kiddos from waking up too early because of loud noises! It is PLENTY loud have never needed to put it on the highest setting and I love that it can be plugged into the wall or run on batteries. We travel often and this makes it SOOOO much easier to put kids down to sounds they are used to! Small enough to throw in a suitcase no problem! love love love it!
1,short and to the point This book provides easy and fun to read advice for business oriented writing. It is short but still full of real life examples.It is worth reading it just for the pleasure of reading.
1,"Great Phones, Great Price! If your tired of trying to find a pair of inexpensive headphones to break even with then stop right here! The Sennheiser HD  phones will serve you well. The sound they produce is good enough to make me smile. The highs are crisp and clear. Even the lows produced by these little wonders will make buying them worth your wild.This makes my second pair and I would only change to something else if Sennheiser quit making them. Just try to remember that everyboby hears differently. What sounds good to some folks may not sound as good to others. They also do a good job of blocking out unwanted noise while your listening to your favorite tunes and movies.All I know is that they work great for me and hopefully theyll work great for you too. Enjoy!"

1,"children in search of answers Rebeccasreads highly recommends TREASURE FOREST as a childrens tale of sorrow  success, where Ben  Sara are compelled to seek answers to their grandmothers last letters in which she asked a question.Filled with the dangers  delights of forest life, Ben  Saras adventures open up a new way of living life in the here  now, with some clear  informative ideas about meditation  enlightenment.Not preachy at all. In fact, TREASURE FOREST is a story for all ages."
1,"Im eagerly awaiting Season  This is simply the best series on TV. The mixture of interesting characters and humor they never take themselves too seriously makes it a delightful show. Plus it doesnt hurt that there are some lovely ladies on the show Officer Aereyn Sun to name one.A Friday time slot, however, was always difficult. I missed alot of them and am looking forward to seeing Farscape in its entirety. Got Season  and now eagerly anticipating Season ."

1,"School Disco to Gay Club, GirlNextDoor to SexKylie rd Album from PWL. It was Better The Devil You Know st single from this album which moved Minogue from school disco to gay club. Step Back In Time, What Do I Have To Do, and Shocked are also unrepeatable hot tracks from PWL. The conflict between Waterman and Minogue resulted in allowing her to write  songs with American producers known for Madonna, Paula Abdul and Martica. Rhythm Of Love is full of great dance tunes and the most loved Kylie album from PWL among Kylie fans. This album also changed the image of Minogue from girlnextdoor to medianame SexKylie The Australian movie Priscilla  Queen of the Desert was originally written about male Kylie impersonaters!"
1,"Mysterious Discoveries This book, for kids , is an engaging tale of a summer in Germany. Nika and her friend Torsten discover the identity of dinosaur fossils in an archaeological dig, recover evidence that the ancient Romans collected fossilsand they solve the mystery of a secret room in an old inn.Archaeological, paleontological, and historical material is expertly woven into a story that is at once exciting and emotionally complex. Highly recommended!"
1,"Gary Hoyt I have owned this toothbrush for approx.  years and other than the noise it puts out, a good toothbrush.The brush heads poping off have not been a problem for me. I use the brush  times each day.Its now mid Jan.. The Cybersonic is still going strong. Noisy but strong."
1,"An engaging story on two tracks  present and past This novel runs on two tracks the life of a London academic couple and their infant daughter on an early Spring sojourn to their second home in Englands rural hinterlands and a highly speculative and evolving narrative on the meaning and context of Pieter Breughels th century paintings.On the latter track, the protagonists personal quest eventually seems to get woven in with his art historical musings.The novel turns into a sort of Keystone Kops story for intellectuals as the action reaches its frightening crescendo. But all ends well. I was pleasantly surprised by the life decision of Martins wife that enabled her to overcome the conseqences of his headlong fall into reckless adventure and financial shennanigans.A smart and entertaining book with an out of the ordinary structure, plus very wellcrafted use of language and situations. A cerebral thriller of sorts that can be enjoyed at the beach."
1,"Beautiful book Even if you are too lazy to create a garden, this book is a beauty to look at. You can use his ideas in a little garden, as well as the White House Rose Garden. The photography is great, and the colors are inspiring. It is, however, a little expensive."
1,"Captivating story The Help was a surprise to me. I had heard that the book was a great read, but hesitated because usually i choose the mystery. The Millennium series trilogy by Stieg Larsson is by far the best in that category. I would have to say though that The Help and Water for Elephants which is also out of my usual choices, are two of the best listens around. The story and narration are excellent."
1,"its one of those hard to find sounds sounds that are good I feel that this paricular group has a sound that sooths you, and is great music to concentrate to. As a musician, i know its easy to get writers block when your on a role, and this music is a great way to relax to and find insperation. The offodd beats and the sustain and fallback of synthysised music give an atmosphere that emerse you in a noncultural environment. I mean music with little trace of definate ethnicity give it that certain sound. Its one of those hard to find sounds sounds that are good. Nomatter what genre of music you listen to, I highly recommend this, and all the other albums from this group. Hell, im into idustrial,grunge music, and i think its the bomb."
1,Corner Gas  Season  This item was as stated but the delivery was very slow. Was ordered as a gift which was VERY late. I was disappointed and the receiver of the gift was disappointed also. Would have liked to order copies of other seasons for same person but afraid will have same problem....will have to reconsider!
1,"Pleasant surprise I bought this on a whim, after hearing a few  sec bites. It sounded good enough to give a try. If you like early Eagles, or Poco, etc, youll really like this. It has a nice, clean, straightforward countryrockish sound. I liked it alot."
1,"Its All About Sade The one thing that I love about Sade is that her music is just about thatthe music and her soulful voice. I expected when I purchased this CD that she would have clouded it with rb cameos, but no. Its her and Sweetback and that all they need. Still the best and the symbol of smooth soul."
1,Its a BIG one! I havent tried this skillet yet but wanted to let you know that the  is a very large skillet. I have a double wall oven so its a bit smaller than standard. The skillet is too large to fit into my oven! I am returning it and ordering the . Im looking forward to making use of it!
1,"Great Classic Mystery This is one of my favorite Bette Davis movies! Excellent. A great mysterythriller with a stellar cast. Agnes Moorehead shines as the devoted yet strange housekeeper, and Olivia de Havilland is wonderful as the scheming cousin. In my opinion, a must have for every classic movie collection."
1,"Living Enlightenment in everyday life Encounter the east with eyes of the west!Encounter the True Self in the course of mid life crisis.Rediscovering the easily forgotten secret of happy life Being mindful and Being present in the moment.Above all, Absoltely Funny but smiles from the deepest!I highly recommend to you who always feel that there are something missing in your life."
1,"Kicked My Butt!! Oh my goodness! This dvd was intense. Over a year ago I decided that I was done with being unhealthy and wanted to feel good about myself again after having  kids. Ive been staying active, and eating healthy. Ive lost  pounds so far and its all thanks to The Biggest Loser and their products. I watch the show religously and have most of their workout dvds to use at home. This dvd will kick your butt! And I dont consider myself to be a beginner at working out, but it was an intense workout from begining to end. It wore me out and it was worth buying."
1,"Eight in One! This volume has all the most popular Sunset cookbooks. My favorite is the Cookies section, followed by the Appetizers. Loads of pictures, and clear instructions. Particuarly good for beginners, and a basic resource for more experienced cooks."
1,"A really good book I really liked this book. I was surprised that the story seemed to move as well as it did, considering its one of the shorter Sunfire books. Did anyone else notice how the books got skinnier as the series went on? The story was, for as much as a romance book can be, believable. Margaret is a great character and there was a nice twist with the usual two guys and a girl theme."
1,"Great for Grama! We bought this little guy for a song on Black Friday at Walmart  you dont want to know what they were selling it for because it was equal to the price of their cartridges..okay we spent .! It not only paid to brave the crowds after Thankgiving, but it pleased the Grandmother who only wants to make copies of obituaries to send to her friends. Morbid, but heh, if you were  and lived in the Cold Belt of Upstate New York, thats about all youd have energy to do after you unfroze your fingers from shoveling snow all the time! Anyway, Grama just loves this printer, as do all her grandchildren who frequently visit and scan in pitures or email papers into their college professors. Cool! It is a real favorite of everyone, especially easy to work and lightening fast when it comes to comes  watch out if your standing in front. We used to be diehard CANON fans but HP has sold us on this one. Thanks! From now on you will be called Heavanly Printers!"
1,"Great Machine for the Money This is a fantastic machine for the money. It is fast and efficient and runs beautifully. I dont find the fan to be annoying at all. It can actually be quite soothing while I work and turns off when you put the machine to sleep. I would definitely recommend buying with more memory. I bought mine with MB, but be sure to start with at least MB.If you want a mac G and are on a budget, this is the machine for you."
1,"The ABCs of Ballet While a good book for little ballerinas, i wish that there were a few other basic terms in the book that were not in there for some reason. It also tended to show alot of the steps while en pointe  not on flats. I feel that this will just make the young ones keep going up on their toes  can possibly hurt themselves. Most girls go en pointe between  yrs of age. This book was meant for beginners, not ones that have been in classes for years. I still find that it does give basic info, which is extremely helpful for the children  their parents."
1,"A Whole Lot of Good This is a good album,with few songs that you skip.They eventually all grow on you and it turns into a really great CD.My favourite song is still Long Day,but Kody is just one of those songs.It has all the ingredients of a fantastic album, great vocals,deep lyrics and catchy riffs. I bought it years ago and will always like it,however,once youve had it for more than  or  years and you hear it,you want to chuck it away sometimes or swap it.Dont, cos one day when youve virtually forgotten all their first songs,youll give it a listen and fall in love all over again.kaduhotmail.com"
1,"Better than I remembered it! Read the John Carter of Mars series back in junior high school. I remembered the violence of the culture created by ERB in that series and the concept of honor in battle, but I had forgotten that there were underlying messages relating to family values, honesty, integrity, trust, the individuals right to seek success, the strength to stand up for ones own beliefs. While the storyline definitely is somewhat thin, the book reads easily and leaves no loose ends. Didnt see the recent movie that came out based on the series kind of glad that I didnt. It was fun venturing back into that realm of imagination that only books can provide."
1,"Great pianist, Great Intrpretation Aleksander is a great performer with a marvelous technique and musical understanding. His flawless rendition of the monstrous Islamey is one of the best i have ever heard. I wont get into details of the pieces but I just want to post the names of the tracks on the cd.The tracks on the cd are. Balakirev  Islamey an Oriental Fantasy. Chopin  Etude in C Major, Op. , . Chopin  Mazurka in A Minor, Op. , . Chopin  Scherzo No.  in C Sharp Minor, Op. . Chopin  Polonaise in A Flat Major, Op. . Liszt  La Campanella, Paganini Etude No. . Beethoven  Bagatelle Op. , No. , A Major. Beethoven  Bagatelle Op. , No.  C Major. Beethoven  Bagatelle Op. , No.  D Major.Beethoven  Bagatelle Op. , No.  A Flat Major.Rachmaninov  Etude Tableau in E Flat Minor, Op. , .Debussy  Prelude Bruyeres from Book .Szymanowsky  Sonata No. , Op. I highly recommend this wonderful cd."
1,"Odd, but compelling This is definitely an odd album with a mixture of Primussounding and Phishsounding songs as mentioned in the other reviews.I do believe that the lyrics and sound make for an overall darker album than I had expected. I find The Grand Pecking Order reminiscent of some early Pink Floyd albums, such as A Saucerful of Secrets, and Obscured by Clouds, all of which are an eclectic mix of weirdness, darkness, psychedelia, and some catchy tunes. Les Claypool is definitely a fan of Pink Floyd, and it shows on this album.Overall, I enjoyed the sound of the album and would recommend it to anyone into Primus, Phish, or Floyd."
1,"Highly recommended Playing Barrios requires more than just excellent technique. The performer has to capture the darkness in the light passages, like a yearning in moments of gaiety..Also, capture the light in the dark passages, as a ray of optimissim in moments of sorrow. Ms Goni captures all these emotions profoundly in this highly recommended CD.The programme features rarely heard gems like Humouresque, Pepita, and the magical Tu y Yo. Her expressive phrasing often breathes new life into the often played works such as Maxixe, Junto a Tu Corazon, Vals no.Romantic guitar music, with Latin American folkloric influence"
1,"Factora...De Ritmo En la misma lnea de grupos como El Chombo, famosos por su Gato Volador, as como Fulanito entre otros, llega la Factora, que con su tema Todava se encuentra en los primeros lugares de popularidad en Mxico y Centroamrica.Con certeza se puede decir que este CD es una verdadera invitacin a bailar. Recomendable para los odos que desean ritmos alegres y danzables. Contiene melodas, tonadas y letras tan contagiosas que resulta casi imposible alejarlas de la mente durante todo el transcurso del da.Este es un CD sin ms pretenciones que levantar el nimo y poner contento a quien lo escuche...y lo logra!"
1,"Seems Good So Far I havent encountered any of the issues the past reviewers have yet but I can say that its a VERY tight fit in the lighter port in the car. Its a bit of a struggle to get it out once its in. Other than that, I like the product, it works well and if I get a year out of it, well its worth it."
1,"simply summed up... Heres the deal with this movie.....If you are the kind of person who needs the laughter button to remind you that a certain part of a movietv show is funny then this flick is not for you. On the other hand, if you have any sense of humor I really cant see how you couldnt enjoy this movie. The characters are all cleverly made and the idea behind the movie is truly original. Napolean is the posterchild for a dork, dork, dork....He wears black snow boots in the summer for crying out loud! This is definatley a cult movie on par with The Big Lebowski, Army of Darkness, The Warriors, ect, ect, ect. You will either know all the lines to the movie or you will watch it once and never again. hope that helps."
1,"The best volume of the best series!!!!! This is the best Dragonball Z manga book since volume . In this graphic novel, Goku has just been stricken by the heart virus, while the Z fighters get their butts kicked by the newly awakned Androids No.   . After getting his butt kicked by Android , Piccolo goes to KamiSamas Palace to fuse with KamiSama. But Kami wants to wait to see what will happen...... As seen in Vizs Shonen Jump Magazine. If you dont understand what im saying its best to read Vols.  before this one they all are pretty good."
1,"Great sound and worth every penny I was impressed by how clear, responsive, and hiss free the speakers are at a regular and very low listening volumes. They tend to become twingy at higher volumes, about  max volume, but this is easily compenstated for by using the computers equilizer. The very low frequencies are not present but for  of music and movies I watch it doesnt matter. The sound is far suppier than my  Aiwa stereo which I bought a couple years ago which is several times larger in size. Great deal with the  rebate and well built."
1,"The return of the William Tell Overture Everyone thinks of the Lone Ranger when they hear the William Tell Overture, but that longrunning radio show used lots of other classical music, and other music including some from a  movie serial about the masked man, during its long run and eventual move to television. Now readers can find out what all that music was, its sources, and how it wound up in a western adventure show. The author has done yeoman research in recreating this history of a radio classic."
1,"Dont listen to the negative reviews. Oh, theres no plot, they say. Then they obviously didnt watch the movie, and have no clue as to how the real spy world works. Sure, the plot may not involve the destruction of an entire city Goldeneye, but rather, the plot is much more clandestine, which makes for a better spy film anyway. Cruise, unlike the other people say, did a remarkable job acting, and had a good supporting cast. There is very good action and suspense. Ok, the tunnel scene at the end is questionable on the reality scale, but it made for a good movie. The music in the film is very fitting and suspenseful. Mission Impossible never gets old. Its complicated, and is a very real spy movie, unlike James Bond and the rest. In reality, it compliments the TV series very well. I just hope the sequal is just as good, if not better. Buy it  trust me, you wont regret it."
1,"Its too easy to join the antismoking hysteria uncritically and Jacob Sullum resists the temptation. Unlike so many recent books on similar subjects, Sullum examines the arguments on their merits. Surprise! surprise! looked at objectively, without the preconceived bias most authors never try to hide, there is actually a complex issue at stake here. Reasonable readers will find many of their most treasured myths about smoking punctured. see the Appendix, Ten Myths of the AntiSmoking Movement for a quick summary.Those who have read Sullums recent articles on the subject in Harpers or Reason will enjoy the indepth coverage of issues and graphics of antismoking propaganda."
1,"Good briefing. It was good to have this consolidated brief of Roberts Rules which, as you know can be overwhelming at times. I carry it with me all the time when I have to attend meetings. It comes in really handy."
1,The best As fans of this movie we decided to go for the extended version and we are totally excited about it. As reviews told us there is much more about the hobbits. The extra scenes add so much to the movie. Love the scenery. The blu ray makes it a real treat to watch these movies. We will enjoy even more watching for years to come
1,"Great First Toy It was hard for us to find many toys for my daughter when she was just a few months old, other than your regular old teethers and rattles. My Mom bought this for my daughter and she absolutely loved it. Her favorite thing was finding the crinkly sound that two of the sections of the worm makes. Each section is different,one has a rattle, one squeeks, and if you push the head, it plays a little song. My daughter is   now, and doesnt play with this much anymore...shes into baby dolls now, but I would defenatley reccommend this item for a baby."
1,"Raw bra! This guitar is a GREAT guitar for your money! I say National Smashional! Who gives a hoot! This guitar looks and feels great. I would make sure you arent allergic to certain metals though as I was getting a slight rash on my arm, just duct taped it up and on to a great play! I recommend this guitar, surely."
1,"To Kill A Mockingbird To Kill A Mockingbird is a must read. It is a story of two children Jem and Scout from Maycomb County growing up and experiencing new things. Engenius and talented, these two explore Maycomb through couple of summers, learning and developing. Harper Lee uses very good symbolism and portrays the characters in a style that the characters seem to be really alive.Exciting and mysterious this book will take you down to the the south where you will experience racism and compromise. Each day for the two characters is an adventure and their wise father and many neighbors make life exciting, especially Arthur Radley. The two experience loss, hatred, love, and understanding and they soon realize their place in the world and why things happen."
1,"...on that day the dead will walk the earth I almost fainted when I found this movie at the used video store. Just in time for Halloween! Something from the beyond must have been calling me.Now this evil little classic lives up to the hype and then some. Its filled with horrific visuals. Chains whipping chunks of human flesh from the bone. Eye gouging. Faces getting mutilated byokay, Ive already said too much. If youre a fan of zombie movies and extreme horror, do your best to get your hands on this as soon as possible.Become part of the infection."
1,"excellent, one of the years best the first  minutes was a tour de force, excellent filmmaking! the end got a little predictable and sentimental, but still good.yes, its a homage to earlier spielberg movies, especially ET, and a little close encounters. still, the script is outstanding, funny, and heartfelt. the kids are excellent and clever in a realistic way. born in the s myself, a little nostalgia is always welcome i can remember when i painted actionfantasy figures toomodel trains... the days before video games and internet!!!!thumbs up !!"
1,"The best sound machine This is the best sound machine ever. We had a different one for my  month old son, and we bought this when our second baby was born. It has great sounds, gets very loud if you want it too, and isnt annoying. Its easy to use, and does the job. Im buying a second one to replace my older sons, this one really is the best."
1,"Does its job Not much to say  purchased at the same time as the Wii. I hooked up the Wii to my TV using these cables and they work just fine. Ive never used the cables that come with the Wii, so cannot comment on any improvement using these cables. All I can say is that the images using these cables are great."
1,"Wonderful for travel This is an excellent gadget for travel. It is very easy to use. You can quickly transfer all of your photos to the ESP and then reuse your memory card. It is fun to sit around with friends and look at the days travel pictures. I carry pictures of my family and pets with me and look at them when I am traveling and if appropriate even share a few with people I meet when traveling. It is amazing what happens when I look at my pictures on an airplane  the Wolverine ESP becomes the center of attention and everyone wants to see it and then buy one after they see what it is capable of. For me, it is as much a camera accessory as is my camera battery charger."
1,"An underrated oscar winner Although Citizen Kane deserved the  oscars for best picture and best director, this movie the actual winner is excellent in its own right. For some reason it is not as popular as some of John Fords other movies. How Green Was My Valley is somewhat similar to The Grapes of Wrath, for which John Ford won the oscar the year before. Both are dramas about families coping with difficult economic times. Valley is somewhat more episodic than Wrath, held together by Huws memories of his childhood. Excellent performances all around, especially Donald Crisp and a young Roddy McDowell."
1,"JUST WHAT WE NEEDED This album is the best work, alongside Madonnas American Life, put out in recent times. It is poetic, smart, and actually has meaning behind it. Courntey does not work with the trends and put out a pop album, but a grunge one. One with such emotion that it needs to be experienced by all."
1,"Full of interesting possibilities I wouldnt recommend this work as a reference for scholars, but perhaps as a reference for poets and other writers. While etymological connections are often used to make sweeping claims that dont stand up to even light scrutiny, this sort of thing can be fun, if not inspiring, where not taken too seriously. I dont think the authors substantial effort was wasted at all."
1,"Motorcycle lock I got this to lock my motorcycle up when parked.It would not stop a determined thief by any means, but not much would, and I live in a fairly safe area. The length is good and lets me lock it to my porch or fence easily, as well as giving me plenty of length to lock it up just about anywhere I park. Im pretty happy with the purchase and it makes me feel better to know my motorcycle wont be as easily carried away.If you have a nice bike that is at risk, you probably shouldnt use this as your only lock. This would also be a great lock to lock gear to your bike, but I generally carry mine so I havent used it for that.One annoying issue is that the plastic or rubber key caps are coming off both the keys, but not enough so I can pull them off completely, just enough to bug me."
1,So far so good! I ordered this because my new computer didnt have an infra red sensor on it. This product does its job really well. No problems with the Syncing. Great price as well. Something similar costs way too much for a brand name.
1,"Great bag for one dslr I have a Nikon D and this bag fits my D PERFECTLY! It can also hold small misc things in the various zippers all over the bag i.e. memory cards, flash drives, cleaning kits, tabletop tripod included but too small to hold up the D, and other various small items. All I have right now is my camera and small accessories, but if you have a dslr camera AND a flash then your going to need a bigger bag. But its the perfect size for just the camera! I love it!!"
1,"The recipes were good but....... I liked Caseys recipes but..it was almost tiring just reading her instructions,like...start with this pan,then put the mixture in that pan...then stir both pans at the same time.I make and mix my soap in one pan,its really not that difficult.I agree with another reviewer who said it doesnt have to be a team effort.The best soapmaking book I have ever bought is The Everything Soapmaking Book by Alicia Grosso. This book has all the information you will ever need to make really beautiful handmade soap."
1,"Of Mice and Men After reading the novel of Mice and Men, i gave the book four stars because it is a very interesting. This book always kept me entertained. In my opnion the whole book was the climax because therof the novel. George and Lennie are two great characters that protrayed a great friendship. Although Lennie was slow, you got a sense of how protective George was of him. There jounray across the country to find there dreams by getting a house together, thought would have come true but was tragically ended."
1,"The Girl Cant Help It DIVINEs most glamourous role where she shows Connie and Raymond Marble jealous perverts, that she is the filthiest person alive. This is one of the first John Waters film I saw years ago and fell in love with. It remains one of my favorite films of his. But if you want Divine at her BEST! You must watch Female Trouble!"
1,"Heavy Heavy Heavy Excellent sander, but not a palm sander. If you try sanding old fascia still hanging with this one, you are either a world class weight lifter or you wont succeed. Love the precise handling and raw power to take off materials, but will probably pick up the small palm for small jobs or jobs that are overhead inplace pieces.The  disks are available all over, and I have sanded very narrow wood with this, almost a planer on some small wood. Good tool."
1,"A glimpse into the hardships of prairie life An interesting way to learn of the difficulties pioneers had in settling the Colorado Territory. Mattie is an admirable character who meets the challenges of prairie life and marital disappointment with courage and integrity. Despite some contrived events, overall this is a heartwarming memorable story."
1,"Catie Curtis is freakin amazing! Well... Im not really a hotel clerk in Jersey, but I could be... if it meant I got to be Caties soulmate...I own all three of Caties CDs,and I love all of them dearly, but this is, by far, my favorite! I have owned it for over two weeks, and havent taken it out of my CD player yet! Not only has she grown as a singer, but as a songwriter too. These songs speak to me on a much more personal, but somehow universal level, than her earlier songs do. I always find it freaky when singers write songs that apply exactly to my life, and that is exactly what Catie has done with songs like Fall Away, Ill Cover you, Whats the Matter, and Magnolia Street in A Crash Course in Roses. Buy it! Youll be tickled pink! Well, at least, I was..."
1,"Does not work with Ipod or Iphone on MacBooks Pro So far it has been a great purchase, the only issue is that it does not work with Ipod touch nor Iphone, keeps trying to power them up, but not even synchronize. So if youre planning to use with your Ipod touch or Iphone keep looking, this is not for you. Other than that, its great for mac users. Dont need to install any driver and it works right out of the box, reads usb sticks and flash drives very fast."
1,"An Excellent Reference This volume provides an encyclopedic reference of musical compositions that is sure to be useful to the professional as well as to those amateurs like me who enjoy collecting and listening to concert music. A little overwhelming to the novice perhaps, but invaluable none the less. I have never before seen a reference that listed the individual arias in an opera. One quible. The earliest composer cataloged is Monteverdi. As a lover of Renaissance music, I missed Byrd, Palestrina, Josquin Desprez and others in that period. No doubt the material from those earlier eras poses research challenges beyond the scope of the project but the book feels a little incomplete without them."
1,"The Best Basketball Game Ever If you are a basketball fan this is the game for you. The fast pace game makes it challenging but when you take it to the hole, you better watch out theres two more on the board. With amazing dunks and the sweetest crossovers NBA LIVE  has game of the year written all over it. Plus, graphics like youve never seen. Congradulations EA this game gets five stars for sure."
1,"Blu Ray Sound of Music stunning picture Seeing is believing, this Blu Ray is breathtaking in so many scenes. The scenes in the Abbey were so crisp I felt like I was  again seeing the film for the first time on the big screen in an early s revival. Salzburg has never looked this good. You can even see the delicate patterns in the tweed jackets.The audio is music to the ears dont shoot me for the bad pun please. The  sounds studio quality again.Did anyone else have a crush on Christopher Plummer the first time you saw the movie?"
1,"I have finally found authentic Mexican cooking!! This is a very good book that will teach you how to make delicious Mexican food. Great recipes,I had always been curious how they made refried beans so creamy,OMG now I know its because of so much lard! I did not give  stars, because the tamale section does not go into enough detail.I feel it left out alot of detail that a true beginner tamale maker needs.So,If youre main interest is learning how to make delicious and authentic tamales buy Tamales  A beginners guide to making traditional tamales by Alice Guadalupe Tapp. That book is  stars."
1,The Jacksons An American Dream Great insight into the Jacksons. This movie is emotional and when they first came on the charts here in Australia I had no idea of what they went through to becaome the stars they were. All we new was that they were better than the Osmands. At least the Jacksons didnt alwasy sing other peoples songs. Great to watch I am glad I have it.
1,What can I say.........Instant Classic. This is one of the greatest albums ever made in my opinion. When I listen to this and think of Kurts life it almost makes me cry. Its that good! A definite MUST for a fan of music. PERIOD! You MUST hear this! If your going to listen to any kind of s music let it be this. Kurt Cobains voice is mesmorising and the guitars are great. Nirvana has created a masterpiece. Believe me Teen Spirit is NOT Nirvanas only good song. NeverMind is beyond words. I love this album and I hope you will too. We all miss you Kurt.
1,"You will like this product I enjoy this glass for several reasons it fits in your hand well you can put the glass down on any surface without worrying about rings being left and it keeps the beverages at almost the same temperature you start with longer... you do not need as much ice, for example."
1,"something very precious at a nominal price My immigration application under skilled worker class is already in process but I was worried about what might happen after arriving in Canada and from where I will start. I feel lucky that I found this book on Amazon that contains every bit of settlement information that I need during my settlement process. After reading that book, I come to know that there is a lot of work that I have to start and finish towards my employment eligibility in Canada in my profession  at least  months prior to my travel. I bought something very precious at a nominal price."
1,"To the naysayers, Chaos HAS no purpose, it is what it is. It seems a lot of people was quite disappointed by Resurrection, the six and last vol. of the War of the Spider Queen series.I, for one, wasnt. Becuase the ending, and what Lolth said herself exemplify what we should expect from the Spider Queen to begin with.She is Chaos personified. Chaos HAS no purpose, no reason. It is what it is and that is enough, and what she had done drawing the Demonweb out of the Abyss, renewing herself by devouring her yorthae, the subsequent destruction and routing of her worshippers and cities, just simply the result from the glory of Chaos, of her very nature.The ultimate irony is that most readers probably felt like Quenthel toward the end of the book. But some, like me, who know what to expect from one such as Lolth, practically shiver with delight to know that all this grief and destruction was simply just a spur of the moment whim of a capricicious demon goddess.That in itself is enough."
1,"Review of State Fair Story of one familys visit to the Iowa State faie.Daughter Margy, finds true love on a roller coaster and ditches her boring boy frtiend back home, while son has a failed romance and returns to his home town girl. Some good songs, including It Might As Well Be Spring.."
1,"No problems thus far. Ive had this gamepad for about  weeks now and havent had any problems with it at all. Easy installation, comfortable, and responsive. Its still a PC gamepad though, so the buttons suffer from a bit of clickiness as I call it, whereas a PS controller would have softer buttons. But thats knitpicking. Overall, much better than the wired USB Dualshock version which tends to break down on you for no reason every  months to a year. Probably the best PC gamepad you can get besides the Xbox controller."
1,"Rusties not rusty Chip chip is a good, energetic, highspirited album. Rustie is a spunky singer. The music overall has a traditional flavor, but still has appeal for those who are not hardcore traditional county fans. With  tracks, the album has decent length, the listeners not shortchanged. Good effort, Rustie."
1,"Definitely Worth It This pump works great. Better to not get injured by siphoning without the pump. Product was sold out at first, but I got an email right away by somebody from the seller to figure out what I wanted to do. They told me  weeks, but it came earlier. I would definitely recommend this product and seller."
1,The Irish Republican Army takes a revenge on an informer A semisimple Irish giant of a man turns in his best friend to send his girl friend to America in the s.He is a drunkard and seems to have no idea that he has done something very wrong until the inevitable end.Ireland wants nothing to do with the British empireand has two armies the British which is composed of men wearing Scotch hatsand the underground wearing trench coats.Even today the IRA sends terror into the hearts of otherwise tough people the world over.A very good movie for the s this was a way of showing people in the states that something was going on over there.A lot of blood has been shed over this.
1,Long time Premiere Pro User I recently upgraded to the Mac Pro System from my PC for my digital editing and I needed the Final Cut Pro System but since I was not familiar with the system I needed a little assistance navigating through the programs so that I can use it effectively. I am so pleased with the purchase of this book. It is so through and even though I have been editing for years it is still useful for me when it comes to navigating and using advanced features of Final Cut Pro. You do not have to be an avid reader to appreciate this book and nor do you have to be a pro to appreciate the book because you can skip through and target your weaknesses because the the book is laid out just that way. A smart buy for the novice to the intermediate.
1,"Like coming home again From the moment I dropped the needle down on Agents of Fortune and heard the opening riff from This Aint the Summer of Love, I knew BOC had taken a change in direction. The raw, wicked, alien vibe that ran through their black and white albums was missing, never to be recaptured.If you disagree, then bless you  Im happy for your happiness. But if youve felt the same way, you wont go wrong buying this album. Note  there are two versions of this album  an import and a reissue, both by the title St Cecilia. Some are cheaper, and if you just want the music, compare and try not to get ripped off. Going rate right now is about .The reason I like this album so much is because listening to it is like going back in time and falling in love again  in love with what attracted me to BOC in the first place.Thanks to all the folks who made this album possible. Now there are THREE versions of Im on the Lamb..."

1,Energizer ERP NiMH Cordless Phone Battery Chose this replacement battery over other similar products due to positive reviews. The batteries seem to live up to the expectations and performs very well to date. I would recommend.
1,"Midnight Rain. Good read! Believe it or not, the author of this book is my father! I guess you would think that because of that I would put  stars and say it was the best book ever and it was perfect ...... blahblahblah. But in the end, I did rate it five stars. It was the first book I read from my Dad an I loved it. Loved the comingofage idea and every time you thought everything was okay, it all turned worse! Thats why I loved this book and it was written very good! You should definitely read this and enjoy a good read! I know I did!"
1,"Excellent, but... As a manga fan, I must admit that this work by Clamp is yet another masterpiece. The story is pretty engaging, and artwork is excellent. On the other hand, I dont mind its mature theme, but I cant help but wonder why Clamp decided to make a work based on one of a mans many possible fantasies a beautiful woman or, in this case, a computer who becomes obsessed with her owner, who is not very popular with girls.So, in all, Im impressed by the effort Clamp put forth to bring this work. But, as original as it is, I undoubtly think that it is also one of their most controversal work up to date."
1,"I really liked this film I have no idea why it was not nominated for an Oscar, considering the other films. Leo was excellent, the film flawless sans, the bad makeup which I thing was awfull, the older J. Edgard and his companions make up looked very fake.But I highly recommend the film."
1,"GREAT WAY TO EXPOSE REALITY!!!!!!!!! One great movie about a today issue  powerful people taking over possesssions, respect and even yourself. Why dont they make films like this today... I wonder why!"
1,Trans Rocks You have a be a fan of the style of music Transiberian Orchestra plays. Im a fan of theirs and this album includes some classical undertones which makes this it even better than their normal creations.
1,"Hypothermia Practical and Pathological Aspects This is a conference proceedings book and is very detailed on many aspects of brain hypothermia in the injured brain. It serves the purpose of a reference and research book maintaining an encyclopedic character throughout. It even has new chapters on brain slices, new ICU technologies, aspects of subarachnoid hemorrhage and hypothermia, etc. It has new indications  for cardiac arrest, ischemic stroke, and the traumatically injured brain. This is the new hot volume on hypothermia, excuse the contradiction in terms."
1,"Accurate and Easy to use The Tanita BC Ironman is much easier to read than other scales. It also has more useful information than our old Tanita scale. Based upon other information body fat measurement and caloric estimations, this body composition monitor seems quite accurate. We like it so much, we gave it as gifts to several friends."
1,"Good, melodic Nice melodies throughout, and his voice sounds better than before. But the arrangements are VERY similar throughout, especially if you know how diverse his first record was. Id appreciate some that are more stripped down, or even crazier, but its fairly normal altpop stuff.The songs are very good, but not very emotional, or dramatic. They grow on you over time, especially as he knows how to use melody and chordal progressions. Rare nowadays."
1,"Great stroller Love this stroller. I am getting a second stroller because we use the other so much. It is lightweight and small. Easy to push. It would be nice to have more store more, but I make do stringing a bag over the back. Definitely worth the money!"
1,"Standard classic for painters of botanical subjects This book may not be gorgeous, but it goes into excellent detail about the structure of tree branches, shapes, buds, fruits and leaves. Everything from the shape of branches in a windswept oak to the way the leaves and flowers are structured is covered for flowering leaf trees. Conifers are not covered. The composition of groups of trees as well as examples from artwork are here. The plates are rather hazy and old, as befits this classic work, but it still is a standard for European trees."
1,"I cant say enough good things about Lost. One of my favorite TV shows ever. This is the first season and although it is interesting from the start  the unique aspects of this show dont occur until well into this season and even more in season two. If youve just caught an episode here or there out of sequence, then you are probably not hooked because this is a story line that has to be viewed in order.If you like NOT being able to know whats going to happen next, then this is the show for you. Its full of mystery and has more questions than answers. It doesnt follow the usual Hollywood story lines at all. They are not afraid of killing off main characters. Hold on to your seat  this is a great journey."
1,"The titles of the book and exam match! What else do you need? Read this book, pass this test.As far as being a reference for this information without regard to the certification, I like it.It is well written and makes sense. I have several other certifications MCSE NTv.  through CCIE  and CCVP  and this book works as well or better than the books I had for those certifications.If you dont mind an electronic copy, the PDF of this book has been made available without cost on Junipers web site."
1,"simple and easy Love the simplicity of this product...when it is heating up, this is when I put the sandwiches together...my favorite is cheese and avocado and some tomato sauce. Also love that you dont need to spray it with anything because the material is nonstick. Barely any mess...unless you overload on cheese...Loving my toasted sandwiches."
1,"Beautiful! Boris Vallejo  Julie Bells art is breathtaking! This is a great wall calendar that will add beauty to your room. Everyone that sees the calendar on my wall has to thumb through it. They are fascinated with their work, and so am I. I highly recommend!"
1,"AMAZING GAME!! I was reading these bad reviews for this game yesterday and knew I had to take action. This is one of the best games for Playstation Ive ever played! Some people might not like GEXs commentary, but, you can turn off the commentary. Unlike the original GEX where each world has a different theme, each individual level in this game has a different theme  from a demented cartoon land to inside a TV! My dad and I were laughing our heads off at GEXs hysterical comments. I highly recommend this game for people of all ages!Yours truly, CT"
1,"Relaxing, soothing,  wellwritten music! This is definitely one of those CDs you dont skip around to various tracks. Like a lot of Pink Floyd albums  a lot of Classic Rock albums, it was made for listening from beginning to end. The recording industry doesnt work that way anymore,  its a cryin shame!"
1,"Kept the grooms tux safe and sound I purchased this garment bag when I needed to travel across country via air with my husbands tuxedo for our destination wedding. Though this bag probably doesnt meet most carryon bag size restrictions, its close enough when folded to allow you to sneak it aboard. This product is composed of a lightweight material indicated in the product description. I was very happy about the loop that was located on the bottom of this garment bag because this loop allows for this bag to be easily doubled for convenient travel. In terms of protecting the garment, it performed admirably but I would recommend double bagging any delicate items for anyone that is concerned about providing additional protection for garments inside. Given the situation, this was by far the best of the options available. Given the price, I was very satisfied by this product."
1,"Clearly low quality, but good value Update Havent given me any trouble, but do add a lot of length which may be a problem in tight spaces. I dont know why most are made this way as they would be much more useful shorter.If you are going to be using these regularly or in hightorque scenarios, you might want to go with better ones. Though I have not encountered any problems, its clear from the irregularities that they are of the lowest quality."
1,"what happened? Been a big fan of yours for many years. You send my wife and I on a spiritual journey to another planet. But what happened to Jazzmasters  with , the rap. Completely out of tune with your other greats. Found it disappointing, especially the last song which should be your best. Look forward to your next one when? but without the rap"
1,Santanas eclectic ear candy. For over thirty years Santana has infused his masterful guitar virtousity with vocalists who complement his music. This album does it again. A true confection for the ear.
1,"AWESOME THE COMPANY WE GOT THESE SHOCKS FROM WAS MORE THAN ACCOMODATING. KEPT US INFORMED AND THEIR PRICES WERE A GREAT SAVINGS. AND THE SHOCKS, WELL MY BACK WINDOW FINALLY STAYS UP WHEN I NEED TO LOAD THE BACK OF MY SUV. WHICH IS EXACTLY WHY YOU BUY THE SHOCKS. MONROE IS AN EXCELLENT BRAND."
1,"absolutely love this movie! MARTY has become one of my all time favorite movies! The humor is still funny today, the characters are more real than in most current movies, and the message is timeless. I highly recommend this movie to everyone!!"
1,"Best CD from the Blink boys yet! Being a huge fan for a few years, I consider everything they do good. But there new CD isnt just good, its great! It is a bit more serious, but falls in the same category as their other CDs. I got the CD the first day it hit shelves and I am happy I did."
1,"Slayerfanatics Slayers new album God Hates Us All is the most brutal and heavy Slayer album so far. If you love brutal pounding twisted music I highly recommend this album. You will not be disappointed. Tom Araya goes totally psycho on vocals and bass guitar. While Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman continue to deliver dark riffs and solos on the guitar.Paul Bostaph has a pounding on the drums guaranteed to make your ears bleed. Take it from a dedicated Slayer fan, get your copy and you will love it as I do."
1,"Great tricycle My son loves riding this tricycle. Hes   so hes too little to petal very well, so its nice that he can just rest his feet without needing to petal. I can push him from behind with the pushbar, which is very nice to not need to lean over. A very good tricycle."
1,good soundgarden rarities The Superunkown single is good ebcause is provides some rarities from soundgarden like the acoustic version of Like Suicide and She likes suprises. Its a good comapanion disk to superunknowon.
1,Love the Kindle The Kindle  is extremely easy to use. I was able to show my parents how to use the Kindle  within minutes of it charging. They are able to operate it on thier own. Very user friendly.
1,"Excellent  Entertaining This is a great book. I read it on the . hour flight between Minneapolis and Hawaii  boy was I glad I did. This book is great for history junkies and people who love murder mysteries. If you love both  bonus for you. I loved Devil in the White City, and I loved this book just as much.Larson rips you into this book and just when you think you are going to get some answers  he turns to another plot in the story  it just keeps you reading, and fast. The historical data about wireless communications is worth reading all by itself  not to mention how that piece plays into the final conclusion of this book. For what that is  you will have to read the book.JVD"
1,"Great Sound! This is a great sub for serious beginners who want pretty good stuff. I had this and a   channel amp worked great produced wicked thump in my hatchback. This with a alpine receiver made great music in the car, would def. recommended!"
1,"First of  live Kraan. Yes, music fan from Boston is quite right.After recording  adventurous and unique studio albums, they made the great move, to do a live record.This is where these guys show what high calibre musicians they really are.This is serious quirky kraut jazz rock.Stellar tracks that sound  times better than on the studio .If you are in a rut finding some new music for yourself, this could very well be what you are looking for.This recording is from  and has not dated at all.Sorry ,this is not comparable to anything else I know.Well, I am actually not sorry at all.Need more help with Kraan reviews please check www.progarchives.com"
1,"The REAL Matt is Back Thanks to Widget Magic for taking the time and expense to reproduce this book in all its original glory.Matts matter of fact, easytoread style and his thorough descriptions immediately pull you into his amazing journey to the Pole.Those who have questioned his claims, especially in light of his skin color, will find obvious contrast between Matts simple, clear and honest way of telling this incredible story, and the exaggerated and inconsistent claims of wouldbe explorers and their backers who are unwilling to accept his place in history.More kudos to Widget Magic for resisting the tide of those who would prefer to see a white man in Matts place."
1,"Nice Fan My roomate had a serious issue with the fan I used to have because it was a bit too loud. I need a fan blowing on me when I sleep so I was in a bit of a predicament. I purchased this fan to remedy the situation.The slowest speed of the fan is nearly silent but is a big step down in airflow from the next speed up. All in all, though, it is a very nice fan that did the job I needed it for."
1,this is the BEST toy ! I raise Lab puppies for Canine Companions...so I almost always have a lab puppy around.....this toy has NEVER been destroyed  little feet chewed off though The squeaker has always remained intact. It is a perfect dog toy for land or water play. My current pup LOVES making it squeak so much so that my parrot can now imitate the squeak!
1,"Good for law students who should also see Keith Evans book Goldbergs nutshell is good, but Keith Evans book, Common Sense Rules of Advocacy for Lawyers, is for the law student and new attorney who wants to learn how to be an excellent advocate.Keith Evans practiced as a trial lawyer in California and as a barrister in England. In addition to law school teaching, Mr. Evans also made numerous presentations to different American Inns of Court.Evans book is now published by TheCapitol.Net, and more information about this classic of trial advocacy can be found on their web site thecapitol.netIf you want to be an excellent advocate, your best bet is to buy Goldbergs nutshell and also the Common Sense Rules of Advocacy for Lawyers by Keith Evans."
1,"What about a widescreen version? The movie is excellent and one of my favorite romantic movies. Susan Sarandon is superb as usual. But the fullscreen format leaves half the image out, which is really a shame!"
1,"Excellent Book I wasnt sure that I would like this book when I first picked it up. I am not a very religious person, and religion is a big part of this book. But then I started reading it. I like all of Jodi Picoults books, but this was one of my favorites. I would recommend it to anyone, and have already to a few people!"
1,"Psychological think piece Two women cross paths on the business trail, one young and one older. They clash, then reunite, then get into each others business over a male who is an alleged rapist. Some great acting here and some nice moodiness in the filmmaking. Its got some elements of The Office, with a darker twist. The ambiguous ending is a nice touch. Watch."
1,Worked just as described! Great gift! Great gift for my boyfriends parents. They absolutely loved it! Very inexpensive but looks nice. Dont have trouble with butter coming out like others have described
1,No Sweat! We live in SW Florida where summers are sweaty hot. Not just for people but for cold drinks as well. Frustrated by condensation soaked coasters we decided to try a set of these. They worked so well we ordered another set of the oz size. I recomend the  oz glasses over the .s which are a little too small for most things.
1,"Wok Heaven This Wok rocks! It seasons well, heats fast and hot the way a good restauraunt wok does to get the fry into your Stir Frys. Main handle stays cool extra front handle seems to get a little warmer than I would like, but it doesnt get used very often. We could never get the heat into our stirfrys with a nonstick pan. I swear the teflon acts like an insulator to keep heat from your food. This Wok is all business. Try it, youll never look back."
1,"truly natural childbirth preparation My husband and I have to travel a lot and so we knew we wouldnt be in one place long enough to take a childbirth preparation class. We asked my midwife for suggestions on how to prepare for the home birth of our first baby, and this is what she recommended. Were so glad.Its actually written more towards a hospitalbirth audience, but the principles are the same. My favorite part is the exercises and activities like the husband talking the wife through relaxing through a contraction to practice while pregnant in preparation for childbirth.The only part I dont particularly like is that all the illustrations are blackandwhite photographs of naked women. I dont find them particularly clear, and would have preferred simple line drawings like those used in my pregnancy book The Joy of Pregnancy The Complete, Candid, and Reassuring Companion for ParentstoBe."
1,IME Sbrown Deming This book is well written and illustrates what a system is and how to optimize the whole system. It also gives examples of a how employee are held responsible for factors outside thier control. I would recommend anyone interested in management or business this book.
1,"Great Headphones Great headphones... I had the ER before these and I can truly say that these are better headphones. These headphones dont push out as much bass as the ER, but thats because the ERPs are for sound accuracy. The clarity from these headphones are outstanding. I am hearing things in my music that I never heard before from my ER. I am using a Zune gb and trust me they sound great."
1,"Stranger than Fiction True Stories by Chuck Palahniuk This is, in fact, one of the strangest books I have ever read  also one of the funniest and most endearing. I thought about it for weeks and then sent it to several friends."
1,"FUN FUN FUN This is a wonderful series, it is fun with tongue in cheek humour.There was a possibility that the dvd being for America would not play on our equipment in Australia, no problems at all."
1,New direction for the Batman character Thought they should have used Kevin Conroys voice for the Batman...no disrepect to Robocop. The storyline was great but the animation leads alot to be desired..dont like the block like figure drawing...but this is more the frank miller style...gritty dark graphic novellike appeal...so guess were stuck with it. Overall...enjoyed it.
1,You are going to have to pay attention. If you take this book to the beach you are going to have to sacrifice something. You cant have it both ways. There are several flashbacks that force the reader to keep on top of the story line. The introduction of numerous characters also require the dedicated attention of the reader. A peak into the mafia of tommorrow and their efforts to establish in the west while retaining their ties to their homeland. The main character was likeable. The romance caught me buy surprise and worked well in the story. A good read.
1,"Roswell is done so well! Roswell was one of those shows, to me, that started when I was really young and when found flipping through channels, found this show. It would be a lie to say I watched it but I watched some scenes and in early November of this year, found myself with this great idea to watch the show. I knew I could get into it. Im obsessed, I can say. Every single episode of Roswell is amazing of course some are better than others but this show is so amazing. All the characters are so real and this season never goes downhill...it goes uphill! Get this!"
1,"An excellent book on FrameworksC An excellent book on Frameworks and C. Although some reviewers have written quite scathing reviews, I find the topics the book coveres are really good and useful. The sidebars are quite good and informative. However, this book is not for those people who are used to read bluesky Java books. I recommended this book for strong C people."
1,"great pens! These gel pens really work well, particularly on dark paper which is the reason we got them. Someone got my son some very dark stationary  his regular arsenal of pens wasnt working when he wanted to write thank you notes or letters to his friends. I picked this gel pen pack because I thought the metallic pens  the blues wouldnt be too girly for him  they arent he really likes them, particularly the silver  copper colors  of course the blues. They write smoothly  show up well. Id definitely recommend them if you have dark paper you need to write on."
1,"This review will look like some popular book review for kids First book I found on the subject. I even didnt know Bioenergetics per se before I found this book. Gosh, I just can not believe how much I learned from this book. It has given the definitive base for my concepion of the Universe. It is as readable and enjoyable as a novel or any kind of literature. I think it has influenced me more as a human being than as a Chemistry student. As also an Anthropology student, I found this book impactating. Well, Ill say it again, I just can not believe how much I have learned from this book."
1,"Great value for price I got this product from Amazon for . It works really nice. Connects immidiately with my Sony Ericsson Wi. It had some difficulty connecting to my Sony Vaio laptop. I guess its not the headset, but, cheap bluetooth dongle adaptor creating problems. Gives a sufficient long time before next recharging. Inbuilt betteries recharge in time specified in manual.Its little uncomfortable to ware for a long time. but anyways, how long are you going to keep talking on phone?Size could have been reduced and some times i get complains from other end of low volume level.Overall, this product performs as described by manufacturer. And i would give it .Thank you..."
1,A great and realistic Teachers Movie Most Teaching movies I avoid like the plague. The formula is way too predictable and insulting to me. This film on the other hand is not one of those.It is well written and has a very strong cast of actors that show the career of a British school teacher at one the elite Public read private and very expensive schools for the Upper ClassEstablishment of England.I also like how the female actresses are allowed to be real persons not just part of the props. That and the idea of how a shell shocked soldier of WWI is allowed to gradually grow into becoming a first rate teacher. Altogether a strong and very up lifting film to behold!
1,"Handy Pump I would have given it  stars , but want to see how long it will last . I have only used it a hand full of times . Quality looks good , but time will tell . I feel it is good value for the price ."
1,Appeals to a wide audience Ill make this simple.A If you love science fictionBuy this book.B If you are new to science fictionBuy this book.C If you hate science fictionConvince yourself that you simply havent read good scifi yet and buy this book.
1,GREAT I searched and searched far and beyond to find the wallet my dad wanted. From Las Vegas to Michigan. This is the same one I bought for my father over  years ago and he was so excited to have a new one. Im so thankful that this Harley dealership still has it and they made my father one happy man. Thank you!
1,"NYS practice primer. Very useful as fundamental overview or refresher of NYS practice protocols with due emphasis on the prevalence and application of the CPLR in civil litigation, as well as how that omnibus statute is adjusted by or supersedes case law. Siegel is clear for the most part though the syntax can be eccentric at times  his publications have their own style as readers of the NYS Law Digest know and focuses on actual case prosecution in the court system, particularly in NYSs four leading judicial departments , of course. Consider carefully whether the sections omitted from the student handbook make the practitioners volume a better choice."
1,Favorite Strings Ive Found I got these strings last week and I really like them. I really like the wound rd. Usually that string is really difficult for me to tune because of how the tone differs from the th string but with these strings it sounds great. Not totally sure why but Im giving credit to the relative thickness of the strings.
1,"Laugh out loud and then go shopping..... This is perfect summer reading...easy, light and a breath of fresh air. A group of neurotic New York City shoppers drive to New England to see the leaves change and enjoy taking some souvenirs home. The characters they meet are memorable and will surely remind you of people you have come across in New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts or Maine....in other words....people who are NOT New Yorkers."
1,"One of the FUNNIEST American comedies ... ever ! Do I need to say the words ?...Bruce Willis playing the hardworking office guy ... a looser  ??? . His boss having a BIG dinner party with new  Hope to be a partner . He needs a date !? He is trying to rent his brothers wife , but he doesnt have a  bucks to pay for it . So , his brother setting him up with a blind date ... OH BOY ! Exectly ! Did you ever have a very wrong and bad blind date ? Forget about it ! This one is the ... I dont have the words .

1,THE ONE AND ONLY GAME It was the best game I ever played...even better than the final fantasy series... though sometimes I dabate about that... but still A MUST GET. I mean you have to get this game its better than any other rpgs and challenging enough to get you involed for months. Literally.
1,"A book every child and adult should read. I read this book to my two boys, ages  and . They enjoyed learning about such a great man. Of course, we unlike many Americans, knew something about Roger Williams before we read this book. We are descendents of his, through his son, Daniel. I was very proud to read about such a great man, who did the courageous things that he did at the time that he did them and to be able to call him Grandfather, was a treasured moment. Thank you to the Author for writing the book. What most people do not know is that Freedom of Religion and Separation of Church and State were ideas that he was the first to fight for in America. So whether you are Baptist, Catholic, Muslim or Buddhist, you should Know that the men who wrote the American Constitution, got some of their ideas from a man who lived  years before their time and that he fought for you to be able to worship as you choose."
1,One of my favorite books! I absolutely loved this book and by up extra copies to share when I come across them. Loved that it takes place in Seattle and was able to see the setting.Quirky characters...felt like Ive known many of them.
1,"Beautiful Lyrics When you first listen to Betos music, you wonder how he ever got recorded. The instrumental portion is nothing special and his voice is second rate at best. This was my first impression of him when I heard his music in Cuidad Juarez Mexico. He is very popular there. After the second or third song I began to pay attention to the lyrics and to the way he sings and you begin to understand what the attraction is. His lyrics and storylines are among the best I have ever heard. It seems that he lived through what he sings about. Many of his songs captivate you with his unique style. He is the type of person you would enjoy conversing with for hours. I know most people wont get his music. But those of us who get past his average voice have discovered a gold mine!"
1,"Helpful, but redundant resource..... I purchased Arthurs Helpful intro... and The New Inductive Study Bible suggested in Arthurs Bible studies at the same time. I didnt know the two were redundant, with the exception the biblical text is not included in Arthurs book. I feel Arthurs Helpful intro... might be more useful in the absence of The New Inductive Study Bible. I think both are excellent resources for an introductory study of the Bible, just disappointed that my purchasing power could have been better utilized with one resource."
1,"CENTURIAN! THE LAW OV BURNING! After hearing some samples from this mCD, I have to say that their latest opus Chronozonic Chaos Gods is aLOT BETTER! The vokills are the best Ive heard in DM, pure anger, very human anger! No demonic gurgling! Just AngeR  lots of it! NOt too many vocalists can pull that off! The production is a bit raw in some areas, which is great! The guitars, bass, everything is GREAT! ALL  tracks are killer! Especially ! This definitely blows aways bands like Nile, Caniple Corpse, Boretician, Cryptopsy new, Only to be rivaled by Krisiun, Hate Eternal, Immolation, Incantation, Necrophagia, Sarcophagus! Pick up this monsterous piece of devastating DM, NOW! CHAOS IS THE WAY!"
1,"Hmmmm.... Shameless self promotion by GeoTrax Dad is PATHETIC!! Hmmmm...wonder who wrote the layout manuals. If youre going to selfpromote...at least say you wrote the darn things, and not...I just so happened to find...yada yada How annoying.In any case, my almost  yr old monster boy LOVES his geotrax! He is incredibly rough on his toys and gets bored easily, but the Geotrax stands up on both counts! Wonderful toy that promotes the use of imagination!"
1,"Rethink I ended up sending this CD back, as the signal dropout just before the end of my version of the CD started to give me the irits. I miss it! So I realise I actually liked it more than I admitted in my previous review  stars.I dont actually think it deserves five stars, but the combination of the two reviews makes it    overall, which is fair.Standout track is definitely the last one Teartear. What a sizzling way to end a consistently engaging album!"
1,"Loved this book While we are still not at the trying again stage, it was good to understand what would be ahead for us...emotionally, physically, etc. I would recommend this to anyone looking to have another baby after a miscarriage, stillbirth or early infant loss."
1,good set The only problem I had was getting the fit right on the fins. It is just hit and miss and you dont really know until you order and send back and reorder. My husband who is . and my son who is  both fit this fin. I am size . and fit the one size smaller. I have wide feet and because of that they are a bit snug. The mask worked well  didnt leak and we had a ton of fun using these!
1,"Excellent mystery This novel kept me on the edge of my seat throughout. The book is easy to read, with several twists and turns of intrigue, and the characters are fascinating, but the biggest shocker of all was the surprise ending. This is a must read for all of us mystery lovers.Hats off to Sheila Darragh."
1,"Copy Protection Runis the Experience The music is great if you listen to it on your stereo or in the car, but good luck trying to listen on your computer or mp player. Its like some Soviet era program that makes it just about impossible to do anything with the CDs. I PAYED FOR THESE CDS!!!!! and I cant listen to them in Winamp without jumping through  hoops and theres no way to get them to work on my MP player!!!! Ill never make that mistake again. Ill just download the songs from sharezaa from now on. Shame on the Foo Fighters to agreeing to this BS!"
1,"Patti Lupone Rocks! She is the Ultimate Evita! This CD includes the voice of Patti Lupone as Eva Peron. She is the best Eva there is. Mandy Patankin is a great Che and whoever plays the Mistress is great too. This CD includes the best Lloyd Webber score there is. If there is better, dont say its Cats. Buy this CD! Its awsome and is THE best popopera there is! Lemiz is the runner up."
1,good book This book has so many plot twists its never dull. I really enjoy this series. The action is non stop and well written. I suggest this book for anyone that loves the HBO series or fantasy fiction.
1,"Excellent Book I am new to flamework. I ordered this book to prepare me for a seminar. It was ideal for this purpose. It is written clearly. The photographs help to illustrate the authors points. I would recommend this book to anyone who is new to flamework. To be fair, the book does not focus on beadwork. It provides an overview of flamework including the making of beads and figurines."
1,"If you play guitar this album does not deserve less than  This album has a great lineup of players, and an amazing acoustic piece. This may not be the best sounding Dimeola album because of the early eightees mixes, but the guitar playing is probably the best hes ever recorded. This album cannot deserve less than four stars, especially if youre a guitar player."
1,"ONE STAR? ARE YOU... YOU GOTS TO BE KIDDING I was browsing reviews, and I just had to say something... This CD is Vestas best to date, most consistent... etc etc etc!!! After hopping between sounds for awhile, she seems to have found her niche... Like someone else said, generally her ballads are strongest, but when she gets to the uptempo numbers, it just doesnt fit her... Here, she keeps it jazzy midtempo, and ballad driven...The lyrical content here is so personal... clearly she just got out of a relationship... and she details all the emotions one goes thru from the mistreatment... the breakup... the loneliness, to hopes of reconciliation, to ultimately getting over it and getting on with her life...Unfortunately this CD didnt get the exposure it should have, but this is a great piece of work for jazz and rb fans..."
1,"Swagman Whee Pod So far, I have been pretty happy with this product. It is large enough for my helmet when parked, or my purse and ulock when biking. The lock is a nice feature as I can lock up the small accessories on my bike so I dont have to take them with. I didnt give it  stars as the mounting was more difficult than I expected. It seems like some of the holes for use with the hardware were not spaced quite right, at least for my rack rack that came with my Breezer bike. I did eventually get it mounted by attaching the rear hardware diagonally. Now that its mounted, I like that it doesnt move around as much as my old soft trunk bag did."
1,"Perfect for a Fishfry We have this fryer and like it very much. We always fry outside so there is no mess and smell anyway. We use the burner on our grill or the base for our turkey fryer with this.Its the perfect size for frying fish, hushpuppies, fries and onion rings. Makes a good batch without having to fill with so much oil. Our thermometer works just fine and clips on the pot too. We do usually use it without the basket though and just scoop out as food is done.Lodge is our favorite brand in cast iron. Cast iron is so durable, food doesnt stick to it and most important for us  it puts a little iron in the food, not aluminum like so many products."
1,"Faith No Mushroomhead What lifts this album above that of the other socalled Nu Metal bands are their use of keyboards and the rhythm of the lyrics between the two singers surprisingly complex when pitted against Disturbed or Linkin Park. Admittedly, I am a long time Faith No More fan, and these are the aspects that link Mushroomhead to that influence the most. In many ways, I see this album as what I would have wanted if FNM did another album together.I do find their guitar playing somewhat standard for guys their age centers mostly on chunky, fast paced riffs ala Meshuggah, and their attempts at ballads dont really work for me. They seem at their best when mixing elements of metal, hardcore and dance all into once song. I look forward to more from these guys in the future."
1,"Humane master of the sardonic Jake Thackrays lyrics are literate and his music is melodic and stylish. These are not fashionable qualities but if wit and style have any meaning, this is where you come to hear them. Thackray has the audacity to suggest that women are garrulous, sex is fun and people enjoy themselves quietly in eccentric and humane ways without reference to the Social Services. I have been trying to work out why this is not folk music and all I can say is that he does not take his work seriously and he treats us like adult human beings. That is art but not the lah di dah sort.."
1,Rated  best ever in Rolling Stone!! In a recent poll rolling stone says this is the th best rock album ever. who are we to disagree!  billion  sales and always topping the best album lists says it all!!!
1,"WOW! HOT AND FLAVORFULL I used to go to the local mall to get this soup. I had to wait  minutes just for them to make it. Hot enough to make you sweat a little and flavorfull enough to tingle the taste buds. Add shrimp or chicken, coconut milk and some beansprouts. Heaven in a bowl."
1,"Great set made worse by the second games addition Devil May Cry was a superb game that I have very fond memories of. However the sequel turned out to be the largest disappointment Ive ever experienced from a game.  was both a return to form and a change in direction for the series, but all in all an excellent game for anyone looking to kick some demon butt and challenge themselves. If you get this set, dont bother with . Its not a broken game, but its almost completely devoid of fun or anything that made the first game special. If you enjoy games like God of War, Dantes Inferno, Heavenly Sword, and the new Castlevania, You should enjoy this set."
1,"Dear lord... I thought only the Scifi channel did this. First, let me make it clear that my rating is only for the show itself. This is a great show, probably the best drama since Lost.Now for the packaging I would give this  stars. I HATE part seasons and have always despised the SciFi channel for selling them. Unfortunately since this is the only medium seasons appear to be available in we cant boycott them unless we dont want to see the show ever again. I hope that this will be the only time ABC makes this kind of mistake."
1,"Awesome addition to Bionicle Ive been a Bionicle fan from the start in Summer , and let me tell you, this movie flows right along with the storyline. I expected much less, and got much more to say the least. The only thing I Didnt like were the voice actors. The only ones that reallty fit the character they played were Kopaka, Thau, Vakama, and Hahli. Everyone else just wasnt the right voice for the job, especially Lewa, though he is saved by the actors great depiction of how he talks like using terms such as highflying or windwalking."
1,Awesome Excellent work with logical illustration. Information presented in a simple way. A must have book for forensic practionners.Covers in detail all forensic aspects. Kudos to the authors for an excellent work.
1,"Tragic Pterodactyls Toho, the force behind the Godzilla movies, created another monster mainstay with this one. This time, a small mining community is visited by giant worm bugs. First they cause disappearances in the mine but eventually move out to the surface. But they are the tip of the iceberg for the mine has connected to an ancient cavern containing a gigantic egg.Once the egg hatches, Rodan is born. It eats the bug worms and flies around. For the most part it is an indifferent creature no doing any purposeful harm but its wake causes severe damage. Then there are two of them and the government decides that the creatures must be stopped as their simple existence can cause countless damage.The final moments of this film are sad and tragic. Rodan and spouse are not rampaging monsters, just misplaced. One does not feel any victory at their defeat, only sadness. This was a wonderful film from Toho that took the giant monster kaiju film in a new direction. Definitely worth watching."
1,"Comfortable, practical but a bit floating The pant is very comfortable, flexible, light and well adapted to the waist with a good quality fabric looking like it will last a while. The leg part is however floating and run long and large making it not super practical for running either outdoors or on a the treadmill. Especially true for a pant you can buy only in fixed sizes I wear  length, these pants runs a bit longer for a small size but it does superwell for me for casual wear around the house and exercises not involving running. Overall, I like it a lot for its comfort for targeted uses but beware of the size."
1,"small and cute. Although I dont buy food from McDonalds, I had to get the set of these when they arrived in their Happy Meals. Luckily, I had the option of only buying the dolls which I did and they are on display in my house. They are very cute and small, but not very posable, which is why I give them  stars.If youre looking to buy them, I wouldnt go spending  on just one when you can get the larger Madame Alexander ones for a bit more."
1,"Outstanding Photographs National Geographic has, of course, always been noted for outstanding photography. The book Through the Lens is certainly no exception. It offers great photos covering every corner of the Earth. The book is divided by regions so the photos are grouped appropriately. Credit is given to the photographers, and the dates and places for the pictures are clearly indicated. This is an excellent book to go through slowly while perusing the photos at length. The skill and the vision of the photographers is evident throughout.The book is a companion volume to two other National Geographic books  Wide Angle and In Focus. All the books are excellent."
1,"Great map! Now my kids are learning geography. Weve got this map pinned to the wall in the family room, and almost every day one of my young sons asks where a certain city or country is, and I can just point right to it. The lamination really makes it durable."
1,"Malden Noahs Ark Metal Photo Frame Purchased to go with a Noahs ark nursery. Cant wait to put a photo of our  boys in it together. Very nice piece. Sturdily made. Heavy it is metal, but a great buy. definitely adds to the room."
1,"A book ahead of its time This film is based on the novel written by Ayn Rand who defected from communist Russia. Ahead of its time written in the s about the world we live in today. Exciting and fast moving, so watch it when you have no distractions and pay close attention. Youll love it either way but if you havent read the book, youll wnat to, once youve seen it. Enjoy !"
1,"Kitty Cayenne loves her springs! My cat loves to chase, fetch, and carry her toys. These fit the bill. They are large and keep her entertained for hours. One of the few toys purchased that were an instant hit!"
1,"Hot, Hot, Hot CautionRead at your own risk. Addicted, is filled with twists, turns, lies, love and secrets which make up a lot of drama. Hold on for a rollercoster ride. Unconditional love is what Zoe and Jason shared. Each time I thought the drama was over something else happened. The suspense had me on edge until the very end.My favorite quote from the novel, This is forever. Always has been! Always will be! Deep.Keep up the good work Zane. Be Blessed!"
1,Too Funny for Words my husband and I had viewed a portion of this video at a friends house.. since we didnt get to see all of it we decided to buy it ourselves. Were we ever surprised.. Jeff Dunham is a fantastic ventriliquist.. and well his little people are so lifelike.. They make you forget that they arent humanbeings. You have to see it to enjoy the full effect of the puppets that he has.. And I believe him when he says that they are his friends.. Great performance!
1,Easy read This was a nice clean book. It had romance without a lot if sex. I wish more authors would learn to write cleaner. I like to share books with my grand kids but most of them have too much sex.
1,"A Favorite from Fairouz Of the Fairouz CDs Ive heard so far, this is one of my favorites. The sound quality is not too good, but the music is wonderful. The overall tone is romantic, with songs that generally unfold in an unhurried pace. In addition to a string section, flute and piano make appearances. At times the instrumental accompaniment recedes into the background or perhaps drops out completely putting Fairouzs singing on full display. I am not generally a fan of the way Arabic music makes use of choirs, but I find the choral parts on this CD fairly palatable."
1,"This is The Album!!! First of all it appears to be a very short album, and indeed it is... But I would say that in this case great things did came on a small package.The Art of War its a powerful album with one of Vaders greatest songs This is the War. I liked the fact that album has an amazing intro and it does a great job getting you hyped for Battle This is the War. I like the changes between tracks and in my opinion this album its worth listening.Viva Vader!!!"
1,"A Classic Love Story For me, the love story that falls within the story is most captivating. A forbidden love that cannot hold back, regardless of the consequences. I have watched this movie many times and will continue to do so."
1,"Wonderful Tone, better than more recent interpretations. Mr. Ma opened the  Season of the New York Philharmonic with his signature Dvorak Cello Concerto in B minor. This earlier recording with the same orchestra is stronger to my mind then his most recent performance in which the maestro relied on the tone and quality of the Davidov Stradivarius he plays and slacks off a good deal of his musicianship onto that happy circumstance.This addendum to the largely unavailable primary recording gives good bones to the music with conductor Kurt Masur at the podium."
1,"Suspenseful I enjoy Remics writing quite a bit. This book started great, read wonderfully until  of the way through then it was a little more detached from the path of thought at least for this reader."
1,"Ellis Unit One a Gem If youre a Steve Earle fan, dont let this bargain slip by. Steve and the VRoys do two versions of the classic Johnny Too Bad, and a great cover of Steves Ellis Unit One, which is hard to find anywhere but the soundtrack for Dead Man Walking. This one might not make you change your mind on any death penalty issue, but itll sure make you think about prison guards and bad karma."
1,"Bluegrass Banjo Players Must Have This is my second purchase of Earls book. I have one of the older ones and didnt want to get too much wear on it. This version has some added material. If you want to develop a solid foundation for playing bluegrass banjo, you need to start with Earl."
1,"Speed of Light Ive read some very good and very bad reviews of Ixlandia. It follows the Midsummer Century formula so to speak. It begins with soft jazzy music then takes off into space. You need a stereo that will handle high volume for a song like The Tachyon Directive. You need the right time and place to appreciate this CD. Alone, inside a dark house, on a quiet night, with the volume up high. Now listen to Tachyon Directive. If you dont think the sound is awesome then this CD is not for you."
1,"Sonic . It? or not? Ok. Lets get one thing straight. This aint no snotty little good guy game. For the first time, you can kick the game as a baddy.This time the millitary lock up our little blue buddy and throw away the key. And if the main game bores you, them cute little chaos are back again with even more stuff to do. Now they can evolve!Oh, by the way, say hello to the dark side, Shadow, Dr eggmannRobotnik, and rouge the bat.But before you start thinking this games the best, some stages are dull and you cant get enough of sonic and shadow, but its probably the best game on game cube."
1,"Endearing, Still Funny, No Longer Shocking. There are probably a handful of great films about American youth. American Graffiti, Animal House, Fast Time at Ridgemount High and Dazed and Confused to name a few, not counting John Hughes movies.This was National Lampoons first movie and it remains its best. It has all the right ingredients, a great script with improvisations, a great director John Landis, a great cast, including the immortal John Belushi, hilarious set piecesnow simmer down a bit, shocking subject matters at the timeexpletives, sex and drugs and the Goodbye Mr. Chips!like soundtrack by the great Elmer Bernstein.If you are from that periods, it remains a comedy classic. If not, it is a time capsule of the youth comedy of the late s worthwhile to experience.A good quality bluray and dont miss The Yearbook The Animal House Reunion and Where Are They Now from the Special Features."
1,"shouldve come from the factory with these installed! I installed these on my MX GT. Did it all by myself in my garage with simple hand tools, I was able to remove the old shocks and spring assemblies using a spring compressor. But I brought them to my local garage to have the new springs mounted on my shocks and have them reassembled, then with I brought them home and reinstalled them. Just like all the DIYs on Miata.net drove it around the block gently before setting torque on the bottom bolts. Then didnt get an alignment until about days of driving. Lowered exactly the amount specified and the stance of the car was well improved. You cant really tell that I have these springs on them until I park beside one with stock springs. Ride comfort wasnt sacrificed, well except when trying to clear some of the humungous speed bumps. Next on my list are sway bars!"
1,"Truly intelligent direction This movie features a sterling cast and topnotch production values, but what truly stands out is Fiennes as a director. The clever use of crawls on the TV screen, banners and graffiti helped to narrow the gap between Elizabethan English and McDonalds Happy Meal English.Everything from the lighting effects to the percussive music underscored the emotion. We already knew he was a fine actor but, in Coriolanus, Fiennes showed himself to be an intelligent director dealing with one of Shakespeares more difficult plays. I look forward to his next directorial attempt.Another standout was Brian Cox spot on performance. Is there nothing that man cannot do?"
1,Great Product and Fast Delivery!! I love how fast my product came in and it had everything in the box as it said it was going to plus a memory card! It is in great condition and i would definitely buy from this seller again !
1,"The Film by which all others are compared to This is one if not THE best ever version of A Christmas Carol in my opinion. Alastair Sim does a masterful job of making himself into this role. The casting was excellent. There were many small moments as well that made this movie so memorable. The undertaker at the top of the stairs, Scrooge falling onto his grave stone, and his dying sister crying out that he take care of his nephew Which he missed. These and other scenes added so much more depth to the story.At the end of the movie, Sim does another incredible job becoming the jovial transformed Scrooge. It will bring tears to your eyes.I never tire of this version......"
1,"Epilepsy Dynamic Models  Multicellular Processes Milton and Jungs book is geared to the epileptologist, mathematical modelers, EEG personnel, the research scientist, and the neural engineer. This is not easily digested and understood. You have to read the book in sections to obtain the greatest insights. The book is better on theory and the physics of synchronization processes. The end of the book discusses the chance for a electrical defibrillator. We are presently at a very preliminary stage of development even though a vagal nerve stimulator has been found effective in certain refractory cases of uncontrolled seizures. This book firmly places Epilepsy as a dynamic illness with chaotic, often unpredictable characteristics and sets in motion ideas for a cortical integrated defibrillatory device. Lets hope we innovate and obtain one soon for clinical trials."
1,"served its life well so i bought these in october and one of them just broke today, so i was a little sad, i thought ear buds r supposed to last longer than  months but they didnt. the sound quality was very good for its price and i dont rly thing i need anything better than this. these are very portablefit in my jeans pockets well and they do a fairly good job on noise cancelling. i do recommend buying those if you would change ur headphones often anyway"
1,"Learning About the Story of Christianity I am taking a course in Church History in seminary. This is the first time I have engaged in some indepth study and appreciation of my faith and its roots. This book is outstanding in that the author does an effective job of expounding on personalities, the development of the church, and specific movements which are somewhat complex, and yet uses terms which are easily understood for a new seminary student. I am glad I took this course and especially glad my professor chose this book to introduce graduate students to such extensive information."
1,"Full of interviews and pictures I highly recommend this book. It is literally packed with quotes from interviews, and great photos. Interviews are of everyone involved with the Monkees from the beginning, and the Monkees then and now. Discusses the background of how the show began, and what went on behind the scenes. Also has a discography and TV episode guide, as well as biographies of each of the Monkees. This is a great book, everything you want to know is here."
1,"Well organized with lots of useful information. The author, who obviously has an enormous amount of experience in the field of put and call options, has put together a well organized book, with easily accessible information for the novice investor. Money well spent."
1,"The truth about Hillary At last a book that tells the truth. Hillary must be spending a lot of money by paying people to condemn this book and refer to the truth as lies, but the coverups and corruption of her husband run deep in this family. Anyone with an open mind can read this story for themselves and make there own judgment on whos telling the truth and who has a long history of false claims, corruption and deceitfulness. Her only real true claim to fame is that she married a man who was President. Even Hillary would say behind closed door Who spilled the beans. Electing Hillary for President would be like having Enron CEO in that seat. Read the Book"
1,Great  as usual!!! Blue Skies flys up there with Robyn Carrs best. She always demonstrates an excellent understanding of her topic  and her characters are typically brilliant. If you like this one  try the Grace Vally series or the Virgin River series next.
1,"Riffage in right... This is a must have for fans of instrumental shredmetal guitar. There is not really a single unworthy track here, just some favorites. I Am War, Purple Sky, Chaos, and The Feed are my favorites, yours may be different, but noone should be, even in the least, dissatisfied. If youve never heard of Al Estrada listen to the samples here, they dont really do him justice, but they will give you a taste. IMO he is similiar to Paul Gilbert with some Steve Vai thrown in the mix. The compositions are top notch and seem to flow thru the various tempos and riffs, and the technique is perfect. This one is AAA offering!!! Its worth more than I paid and I say that about very few things!"
1,"intr to soldering Well thought out kit, bought this for my  year old and it was easy to understand and a nice as advertised introduction to soldering and went into an explanation of the components."
1,"Motorhead... Motorhead...Enough said...DVD and CD well worth it. Great mix of new and old tracks. The black and white picture is perfect for the band, they have never had much color just silver and black."
1,going strong after  years My badger  is still working fine after  years! So its noisy. Its only on for  seconds. Spend another  to avoid  noise? I dont think so. Im buying another as a backup bc I figure that it has to be ready to retire soon.
1,"Nice natural alternative to antiperspirant Note, this is not an antiperspirant and wont keep you dry. But it also has no aluminum. Sweating is natural, and this does keep you from getting sweat odor. I prefer deodorant to antiperspirant, and its darn hard to find in the local drugstore so I am glad Toms makes this product. It has a nice feminine scent."
1,"Awesome My daughter is an avid reader. Our house was getting overrun with books. She can now read as much, anywhere we are without the bulk of all the books. I expect is to come in handy on trips as she can have all her books with her."
1,Nice twists The story is an interesting one with a few twists. What we have is a mystery done in a story of two magicians having a petty argument. All the clues are there. The question is can you figure out all the answers? I confess that I only found out part of it.The acting is good as is the filming.
1,"first experiences with my Kindle Exactly something for me while traveling, I normally buy several books in the various airports. This adds to the weight in my shoulder bag. The Kindle is a very good tools it allows me to travel lighter. It is pleasant in use. Only disadvantages I found, are it is not possible to give away the book that I have read, and I experienced that it was not possible to buy a book after having read the first chapter.  New York, by Edward Rutherford. It was not available for some reason.... Will try again later. Lesson learnt do not wait until you have fully read the first chapter with the buying decision once you know that you will want to read the whole book buy it!"
1,"Affordable Quality This DVD will play a variety of formats, and the settings are easy to manipulate. My first purchase, the unit did not work so I exchanged for another one, and this one works great. I think the carosel model damages easier in shipping, but once you get a working unit, it rocks."
1,"GREAT!!!!! I liked this video alot due to the fact that it is not the usual salutation sequence of moves. Lisa has such a nice voice that she draws you in to the exercise and lets you relax, definatly not a Denise Austin, she is  times better!! all in all a GREAT workout that will challenge you from begining to end and will keep you interested for a long time to come. I know that there is a second video out in the series and I plan on getting that one also. GREAT!!!"
1,"Great fan but customer service nonresponsive This is my second fan, so you know I like the product. However, my fan had two left side bases instead of right and left. I called the company and left two messages. No repsonse. I then sent an e mail. No response. Amazon did replace the entire unit at their cost, and sent a call tag to pick up the original fan. Soleus would get five stars aif they had any customer service. The fan is delightful and priced right."
1,"Impressive worke Babylon Mystery Orchestra is a unique band, i first heard of them from a website i stumbled across. At first i didnt know if i liked the vocals or not, but they grew on me, the over all work of the album is very pleasing to listen to, and the individual tracks are varied enough so that its not a boring listen. I highly recommend it to those interested in checking out new metal bands."
1,"A Woman of Influence As readable and absorbing as a great novel, The Duchess of Devonshire develops the story and character of Georgiana, a woman of great gifts and great flaws against the background of Regency England. Amanda Foreman is an outstanding biographer."
1,Rival White Mountain Ice Cream Freezer ASINBNDA Rival FX Quart Electric White Mountain Ice Cream Freezer I have owned other electric ice cream freezers and none of those can blend and freeze the ice cream as well and as fast. I will never purchase a different brand after now having used this product. It has produced excellant results each time I have used it.
1,"GREAT GLOVES Very good price for a great pair of leather gloves that are comfortable, flexible and fit well. Owned a previous pair that lasted a long time for cutting palmettos and general camping use."
1,"Best Circuit Training DVD with Weights I have the Funcercise resistance bands exercise DVD and am fully satisfied with it. I went ahead and got this great Circuit workout DVD with Light weights that I tuck under my bed to rotate my workouts. This Circuit training DVD is easy and simple to follow. The exercises are very effective and target every muscle group. Sunshine shows  demonstrates proper form, which makes it easy to do the exercises correctly. I started by doing one  two set as a beginner and now in  weeks I do the entire  sets non stop. If you want a great circuit training exercise DVD ,this is it! No bells, just fast paced x sets  the Triple Whammy in the end of the workout is a killer. I lost weight and sizes in just a few weeks and feel Great."
1,"A good slicer for the price! I bought this slicer for my daughter and she has been delighted with it. It is easy to clean, lubricates with a little Vaseline, and the meat carrier and width adjuster move with silky smoothness. This slicer fills the niche between cheap and commercial quality at a very reasonable price."
1,"The Ultimate MSB CD If you could only have one MSB album, this is definitely the one to own! No true MSB fan would be caught without it. There is one mindboggling letdown it doesnt include the amazing Working Again, arguably the most popular MSB song ever. But it has all of the bands other standards. So when you need your MSB fix, just pop in Right Back at Ya."
1,"Pulls off tons of hair I love this product. I have a regular cat brush as well, but this one pulls off way more hair than the other. my cat is a long haired cat and this helps me manage the shedding, although i still find hair everywhere haha. I would definitely recommend this to people who have cats who shed."
1,"Essential for churches looking to achieve growth As a leader in my church, I found this book to be a great tool for providing insight and direction into ways to grow your ministry. It is easy to read I finished it in  days and can be used as the focal point for a series of discussions amongst the chuch leadership."
1,"Skate Rock gone soul This CD has been a long time coming, and it is definately worth the wait. Ex pro skateboarder Guerreros passion for living comes through loud and clear on this one, from beginning to end. Youll listen to this album again and again, and be more stoked each time.Unlike anthing that you have heard in a while."
1,"Good CD I really enjoyed the music from the movie and it is all on the CD. Thanks. These are really great updated arrangements of Cole Porters music. If you are looking for classic Cole Porter, this isnt it. Its better. I loved the idea of having different popular singers today cover the tunes."
1,"THE FORCE IS STILL WITH US... I found this to be my personal favorite of the entire STAR WARS saga for several reasons. First, it brings fans what theyve been waiting forYoda fighting, what Boba Fett looks like under the mask, the Clone War, tons o Jedi action, Anakins dark side manifesting, and him and Padme falling in love. Lucas has created a tragic love tale meshed with a actionpacked adventure that preludes to galactic war. The result is a truly amazing film that shows what STAR WARS is really all about. The acting is first rate, especially Christopher Lee as the villainous Count Dooku Darth Tyrannus. Hayden is great as Anakin, because he really makes you feel sorry for him. I mean, he could be having this great life that will never be, since he becomes Vader. Anyone who has seen the old films must see this one. It is much more fun than its predecessor!"
1,"worth the money This product is certainly worth the money. My wife and I purchased one of those birdhouse looking things that gives off the sound when your dog barks and that did nothing. We spent  bucks on that and quickly returned it to get our money back. I bought this collar for my minpin and he hasnt barked but once since we put it on him. The first time he barked he jumped and then whined for a few seconds and that was the last of it. I was slightly concerned about using something like this and traumatizing the little guy, but it has worked out wonderfully. It startles the dog, doesnt hurt them and it has been well woth the  dollars that we spent for it."
1,blooper i have watched the movie several times........but have never noticed the blooper when cujo is at the window and the phone is ringing...you can vividly see a hand reach up and pull him out of the window......
1,"Good, but not what I was expecting Its a great alarm, but not as loud as I thought it would be. I was hoping to use it as a replacement to my other  alarms, but no such luck. I still need to set  alarms every morning to wake up, so it isnt really enough to do the job for a really heavy sleeper.Before I got it, I was late about once a week, since Ive gotten it a month ago, Ive only been late twice."
1,"Surprisingly GOOD! I have never really been an Eurythmics or Annie Lennox fan. However, I decided to buy this CD due to the reviews I had read on Wall of Sound. And, I was pleasantly surprised! This is a very listenable album...and it captures the essence of many different musical styles...from rock...to popish love ballads...to new age. I recommend this one to anyone who wants to get away from the influences of rap and teenie pop....at least for a little while!"
1,"Fun Lounging around the House Entertainment I had a blast lounging around the house in my PJs watching this DVD series. I had missed a lot of episodes and this filled in the gaps. The show is hilarious, witty, intense and dramatic all at the same time!The commentaries by Marc Cherry are excellent as are the other bonus features. Watching the DVD set gave me a new appreciation for the quality of the shows writing. Plus its just plain fun because once one episode ends you can just pop in another!This is a great investment even if you want to watch the DVDs once and then resell them."
1,"Fresh  Strong Fresh because Jo, the survivor of her emotionally abusive mother is only .Fresh because her lover, Maddy is only .Fresh because there arent that many dyke novels centered around one of us choosing to live rough ... out of emotionalsurvival necessity.Fresh because its set in this great park out our way in Queensland.Dont know of any other novels set in New Farm park.I go there with my dog to throw a freesbee.Its a real place.Strong because all the the above is brought togehter into a strong and sensual plot.Enjoyable. Thought provoking.Sure, Id like my best buddies to read it."
1,"More than us... I had the pleasure to go to the gig that the band did in my country recently, so I know a little bit how theyre in stage, and how does it feel to be there, so I can tell you one thing This DVD captures the Travis onstage and if you havent gone to any gig of this wonderful band Im sure that if you like this youll probably love this funny guys specially Dougie Payne and their music. Youll find yourself shouting and singing all of the songs so...watch it at your own risk!"
1,DeWalt battery charger Product came quickly and worked fine. It did not come with an instruction manual or guarantee form. Had to go to deWalt web site for guarantee information and customer service of the supplier to get a link to their pdf file of the instruction manual.
1,"Correction to track Listing Just a correction to the above reviewers track listing. Track  is listed as Fantasy by Jeffrey Phillips Burns .My brother happens to be the composer of this piece, and it was titled incorrectly on the CD. The correct title is Fancy."
1,"A Big FAT help I was extremely skeptical with this product, but I admit the name hooked me. It tones, tightens, and gives you less giggle and wiggle. Plus there is no medicine smell. The best part is the cost. You wont break the bank getting rid of the jiggly stuff. You cant beat that."
1,"Twilight Review A friend gave me this book, and its sequel, as a birthday gift. I was reading another book at the time, but as soon as I cracked open Twilight, the other book was long forgotten. I was hooked once I read to about the second chapter. I am convinced that if my schedule had been a little less hectic at the time, I could have easily found a cozy little spot somewhere and read the book from cover to cover. However, I didnt have time to do this, and so, I admitt, that I read Twilight by the light of my cell phone, on a school night, turning the pages as quietly as I could so as not to alert my mother, who probably thought that I had beeen asleep for hours. I reccomend this book to any and everyone. It is actionpacked and impossible to put down. Definately one of my favorites!"
1,"Very nice! I searched all over extra heavy duty ATO fuse holders for offroad motorcycle wiring and couldnt find anything suitable. I needed something very stout to survive life on a bike and something waterproof to boot.After doing more research I found these on Amazon and decided to give them a try, and they work great. Great price and free shipping on Amazon made these even more attractive. My local parts stores only carry the cheezy  fuse holders that arent even close to being as tough as these.My only complaint is the tails from the fuse holder are only about inches long, a few more inches of wire would have been greatly appreciated but thats the nature of the beast I guess."
1,"Great Upgrade! Microsoft seems to be the company a lot of folks love to hate. However, I think they did an exceptional job with the Office  upgrade and its a fine improvement over the  version. The big benefits are the expanded toolbar ribbon and the real time previews. Both features save a lot of time and make for a nice work environment...especially if you have a good size monitor."
1,"Scripturally accurate presentation of our role and Gods role in our sanctification. Encouragement for every believer in Christ! This book is well written, espouses deep truths from Scripture, uses pertinent and understandable examples, and gives true believers in Christ a great deal of practical help as well as wonderful encouragement based on what Christ has accomplished. It was a great help to me and lends itself well to group discussion."
1,"Works for me, no negative effects for my  lb Dachshund The horror stories relating to this product scared me a bit but Ive experienced no problems with my  lb mini Dachshund.Dont let the negative reviews sway you, the positive effects of this product far outweigh the small possibility of a negative physical reaction. Its human nature to be more likely to post a review if youve had a bad experience with a beloved family pet.My only gripe, I wish it didnt cost  per month."
1,"The Summit of Sound The recording sessions are from  and , with the linkage to both being the collaboration between Miles and Sonny Rollins.And its the  numbers that has particular historical significance, as Charlie Parker is captured in his only work as a sideman for Miles  The Serpents Tooth Take i and Take , Round About Midnight, Compulsion  as the session peaks with Rollins handling the opening and closing bridges on Round About Midnight. Pianist Tommy Flanagan brings his unique swing style to the  studio work.Though the album cover gives the appearance of a bootleg, it is an important glance into a point in time in this summit of sound between Davis and Rollins."
1,"Id give this book  stars or more I am looking for another copy of this book. It is out of print. It would be a rd one, I gave one to a friend and the st one is torn and beat up. They should have named this the Adjective and Adverb Finder. It helps describe any noun or verb in a sentence. I think it did not become popular because of the confusing title. Its the most valuable book reference book I own. If you can find a copy, you better grab it."
1,"This is THE game that sold me on the N system! A total adrenaline rush! The control and physics are incredible. The graphics and sound are a superb treat! This is the first game I purchased for the N and is still my favorite...even after years of playing this game I have managed to find ways to set new course records! Ive played the PSN Jet Motos yawn, but Wave Race  RULES! PLEASE, Nintendo, make a sequel that will blow even this great game out of the water!"
1,"Golden Classic I had a cassette tape of this great album. Now that I own the Cd it is on everything I own.If you can visualize Nat in his prime, singing by some ski lodge fireplace while you hug your best girl, you need this album in your collection!"
1,"Great Text This text is very well written and is easy to read and understand. Im definately not a math person, but this text begins at such a fundamental level and is so thorough that even I am doing well in my online course."
1,"Overcoming the legacy of the III Reich This is an interesting book. The author has in mind two points  The brutalities of Hitlers actions were hidden, at least from those who obeyed, who followed him and thus grew up sheltered inside a totalitarian State. That?s hard for us to believe if we grow up in the Good Ole USA!  As a child, the author was able to conquer fear. He had to become an adult before he could conquer hate. Had he not been taught hate, he wouldnd have had to conquer it. Hate bends minds and we need to over come this kind of thinking. The German version is basically a shortened version. Much that is selfexplanatory to Germans had to be explained to the average American reader."
1,"Good attempt to look at the harsher side of Rome This is a great book for preteens, teens, and even adults who like fiction set in the ancient world. Here we see the harsh social realities faced by foundlings in the life of Beric, Roman child adopted from the sea by Britons during the Roman Empire  when exactly isnt given. While Im glad the attempt was made to show the harshness of life both in the north and then among the Romans there was still a bit of sugarcoating that is perhaps the result of wanting to respect our own morals or the result of a lack of knowledge. Thus the sexual terror and abuse of slavery is not mentioned and there is the idea that slaves have special clothes or jewelery to mark their status which is not the case unless one had been a runaway or a master really wanted to use a collar or brand or tattoo. The ending was also a bit too positive but then again most people dont want to read a sad tale even if it is more realistic."
1,Great fun for  but no more! My year old son loves this toy but I am glad that I did not pay more than ... for it. I guess we were fortunate to receive parts that fit together well when my husband put it together but we have problems with the elevator which does not slide up and down freely. The whirling helicopter is fun. We also received a different version of Diegos harness which fits around his waist....
1,"Captures Even nonFantasy Readers Return of the Queen captured my interest, and I am not a fantasy reader at all. From the independent young queen to the talking cat, who is wonderfully obnoxious, this is a good read. Although there is an ending, there are many possibilities for future stories about the queen and her friends  family. I look forward to a seconed book that picks up where this one ends."
1,"enjoyable story with a believable, symathetic character This was a great new take on an adventure story, where Lou Martinis character goes on a very personal journey to overcome his demons and fight against his addiction. it is a timely topic and a well executed movie. The acting was good and it looked like Lou Martini actually went through the weight loss himself in making this movie."
1,"Mental health This huge novel spans the careers of two pioneering psychiatrists, one French, one English, who meet as boys and eventually cofound a sanatorium in the mountains of Austria, until driven apart by professional disagreements and the outbreak of the first War. For the first  pages of this page book, the story holds the interest with warm characters, fascinating settings, and the stirrings of romance. However, the long lectures and scientific papers that Faulks uses to demonstrate the growing differences between the two one is a Freudian, the other a Darwinian come to clog the book around the halfway point, and although the two men continue to develop in interesting ways as people, he loses the sense of linear narrative. But Faulks pulls it all together in the last hundred pages always a magnificent war novelist seeBIRDSONG, his masterpiece, his WW scenes appear almost as a lyrical interlude, with striking cathartic effect, and his final chapters have their own quiet beauty."
1,"You get what you ordered  and much cheaper than at a specialty store! We live in a small apartment and needed to get a wall mounted pot rack to free up some cabinet space. I ran around all over town and found only one place that actually had potracks in the store. They had a similar one by the same company the difference was it was tricolored for over  more!. I came home and looked online and I did find that two other stores carried them online, but nothing compared with the price I paid here! And its perfect! The round top with the arches lets you stick your lids up there, and all of the set  exculding the stock pot  fits on the rack. Definitely a good buy  and I saved about  bucks!"
1,"Fun but a little flimsy My monthold loves stacking things and sticking things into other things. So this toy was perfect for him, except that the base should be made of something a little more sturdy. Its rather flimsy rubberized material. He cant play with it in his crib or on my bed. He has to place it on a table or something else with a hard surface. Other than that, he seems to really like it."
1,"Great Horny Toads! Nice parody of films like Roger Cormans original Humaniods of the Deep. I especially loved the scene where the guy couldnt hump his girlfriend right, so the frog took over. She was smiling pretty good until she opened her eyes. I guess she wasnt too happy about giving birth to a frog  months later, oh well. Now this is the kind of movie ol Joe Bob used to show on his Drivein Theatre."
1,"Texas music at its finest! Hopefully the rest of the country will wake up and see what Texans have known all along... some of the finest singersongwriters in the world are in our backyard! If this thing had grooves in it, I would have worn it out by now! Now everyone in the world can feel like a Texan, even if just for an hour! Take the phone off the hook, get your main squeeze, grab a cold beverage, head to the back porch or rooftop, put in this CD and watch the sun fall into the west! Another gem by Lyle. Genius songwriting, wonderful arrangements and  Texas! Its a shame that we all cant be in Texas but this CD will put a little Texas in everyone, even if just for an hour! Yeeha!"
1,"An awesome book...an absolute MUST read. Believe it or not, this book is one of the more seminal works of the second half of the twentieth century. Why it is out of print and it is VERY hard to find, because no one will part with their copy is a complete mystery. This very substantial book hundreds of pages, large format, hundreds of photos is the absolute definitive work on bathroom design. In aweinspiring detail, Alexander Kira analyzes bathroom functions versus bathroom fixtures. Imagine, if you will, hundreds of pictures showing people showering and urinating in front of calibrated background grids. The book is at once scholarly, on target, and hysterically funny. It will forever change the way you think of the simple toilet. If you ever see a copy in a used bookstore...grab it"
1,Interesting shed ideas I found this book full of good ideas. I am not very talented when it comes to measuring once and cutting twice.... So get the book use it for ideas THEN have someone else build the shed for you. When you have finished with the book donate it to your local library!
1,I want more I first listened to this band in  with . I have never had an album that I liked ALL the songs on it.  Changed that. Carry On Up The Charts did it again. Since  I have rated every album I buy by its standard. No other band can come close to match TBSs playabilty. Why hasnt this band been in the US. If they can get buggers like Oasis over here then why not someone that is far superior. When will Quench be released in the US?? Cant wait.
1,a must for the individual with an interest in herpetoculure If you have any interest in herpetoculture this magazine subscription really is a must have. You dont have to own reptiles to own reptiles to appreciate the content in this magazine. Also if you do own reptiles they help you become more involved in the reptile community and help further educate you on your hobby. Plus there is some savings in the magazine for cool reptile gear.
1,"Must own masterpiece Every single song on this CD is GREAT!!.Joni Mitchell did something special on this CD, creating a blend of songs that have already and will continue to stand the test of time. If you like Eva Cassady, youll love Jon Mitchell.The album includes cuts from artists such as David Crosby, Graham Nash, Robbie Robertson The Band Jose Feliciano, Joe Sample.Of course you also have to hear Joni doing her version of Woodstock"
1,"super stuff Should be edited further, but a gripping tale of power, and the paradoxical stupidity and grandness of human nature. A book that will ensure we try to judge people by the content of their character and not the colour of their skin."
1,"Stupid and dumb  but funny! This was a true classic of the s. It is a stupid movie that has little story line and even more meaningless characters. Watch it with a grain of salt and just take it for the moronic but funny movie that it is. Dennis Quaid and Fran Drescher make some of their earliest appearances in this film. Fran has always had that irritating, whiny voice  but the breast implants came later. Dennis is a military nut that is way off the deep end. Getting a good buzz or snorting up a bit of a Rush popper will makes this movie even better."
1,"Great movie even if you arent a Star Trek Fan When my husband first wanted to watch this movie, I told him to go ahead and watch it without me. Ive never been a big fan of Star Trek or other scifi movies. After he watched it, he talked me into watching it with him. I loved it. Im looking forward to a sequel."
1,"Everything They Claimed It Would Be!! I never ever ever have time to write reviews of products, but I had to find the time to write this review because this brush is everything that they Amazon reviewers, Youtube reviewers etc. said it would be. My daughter and I have thick, coarse type  hair and this brush glides right through our beautiful kinks. Be sure not to brush unless the hair is fully saturated with water or conditioner. I absolutely love this brush!"
1,"A mustread book This book takes place both in  and , spanning  years in the intertwining lives of several families. It explores the mores of the times in relationship to how the races interacted. Sometimes the reality is hard to deal with, but overarching the storyline is the message that God brings redemption and healing to hurting hearts.I highly recommend this book. Tracey is a very excellent writer."
1,"best pastry book I never make a pie or pastry crust using anyone elses recipe. I know it wont be as good, so I just dont do it. I always use one from this book. That way, theres no anxiety. I know with certainty the crust will be perfect."
1,"Excellent Album! This is an excellent album. Earnest Pugh has done it again! I love his Rain on Us album and A Worshippers Perspective is equally great. The title is named correctly. If you are already a worshipper of God, you will thoroughly enjoy it and if you are not, this album will move you into the presence of the Lord! Although I love the whole album, my favorite song at this time is Speak to Me. If you are going through a trial and need God to give you direction, bask in the song Speak to Me."
1,"NEw Charlie BOne THe Newest Charlie BOne was great like all the others, except for the fact that the editorial review is completely wrong, there is no tree girl and the invisible boy is not Emmas Brother!!!!!!!!!!!! Perhaps we can look for the tree girl in THe Blue Boa which may be another name for the invisible boy, who knows??? Anyway a great site for finding new books ...at amazon."
1,"Quit your bellyaching! I have read some of the negative reviews here and it amazes me how gullible people are. Im sure some of you realize that even with the Sims  and any game for that matter understands that Maxis lists the minimum, I repeat, MINIMUM, requirements needed to play the game. Anyone with common sense would realize that the higher end one goes, the better performance you will get in the long run.I have well above the minimum requirements and my game works just fine. If one is having issues with the game, one needs to find solutions before completely trashing the game. I know its frustrating after all the hype, but it pays off in the long run. At least you can determine whether there is a fix for the situation.Cmon people! At least act like you have minimum intelligence."
1,"Helpful metaphors, stories, checklists... NOT buzzword bingo The author has deep insight into many different business models, and the impact of technology. Plus, and this is a very big plus, this content addresses the leading edge, not the bleeding edge.The tone kept me engaged the whole time. The checklists in the margins make great deskside references, e.g.,  Clues you are telling more than showing.I found the metaphors  stories really helpful in illustrating how business and technological concepts work together to create value. With the overwhelming amount of terms, acronyms, and buzzwords thrown around today, its very refreshing to read a number of solid accounts that describe the concepts in motion, in a wide range of both business and technology situations.I give it an Excellent rating!"
1,"I loved this story. I just finished this book and I loved it. Sometimes in love there is turmoil and struggle. If you want a book where boy and girl meet and go skipping blissfully down the rosy path, this may not be right for you. If you like a story where there is human emotions and the ups and downs that come with being in love, this is a good read."
1,"Good This movie wasnt quite as funny as I thought it would be, but it still had lots of laughs in it. Lance Armstrong makes a great cameo and Ben Stiller plays a great over the top character once again while Vince Vaughn is in his role of a laid back guy just looking to get by. Really, if you are a fan of anyone in this movie then chances are you will like it."
1,"Brilliant takes on broken songs I am not generally a fan of remixes and dont really check them out unless Im pretty fond of an artist. Fortunately in this case, it is great. Calling NIN industrial is a bit of a stretch, but not this EP. You get a bunch of good things for a nice price. Two remixes exist of both Wish and Happiness in Slavery, the latter which has a great remix in the pounding Slave Screams version. The regular Wish remix is great as well.It starts out greatly though with a remix of Gave Up that is perhaps even better than the original. It sounds really insane because it is really insane. Its like listening to Lou Reeds Metal Machine Music, because some people are scared to admit to liking it although its a masterpiece. This and Further Down the Spiral are great buys."
1,medal of honor gets a medal of honor Medal of honor is a very exciting game especially if you like role playing games. The first scene getting off the boat is very much like Saving Private Ryan. If you get past the first mission they do get a little easier. The all access movement is a lot of fun as well.I highly recommend this game!
1,"by KR The main character was Odysseus. Odysseus liked to be a farmer because he had orchards and was a gardner. He was loving. He had his parents live with him. The setting was all around Greece, on different kinds of lands. Odysseus and his men got stuck in a cyclops cave. I loved reading the book. I liked reading about his many adventures. I liked reading about Odysseus and his men escaping a huge Cyclops. I would give it five stars. I loved reading about when he was stuck in the cyclops cave."
1,Great British comedydrama I loved the good carefree feeling one gets watching this series. Each character adds to the series even those that are not as well know as others. Everytime I watch parts of the series I find a little something I missed. I would recommend this a plus to add to a collection.
1,"Excellent This was the book we used the most in Tuscany. The book provides excellent recommendations on restaurants, wineries, markets, cermamics shops and food shops. It helped make our vacation in Tuscany wonderful."
1,"Much better than the reviews indicate Its a B movie. Its D if you buy the D version. Its based off a story most people know almost by heart.It has decent, nonCGI effects. It is fun. It does a homage to NoTLD but is original in many ways, even the zombie portions. It is not a copy, but that is good!I had seen this before and not thought a whole lot about it a few years ago. Now, re watching it I find that it is not too bad, actually much better than I remembered. I even ordered the D version on DVD. Near the end it reminded me of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre  intentional? I dont know. If you are a fan of the zombie genre you should give this one a chance of course, realizing it is a B movie like the original NoTLD. Recommended."
1,"wonderful book We have this book for our baby and now give it as a gift to anyone we know having a baby. It is a great book to introduce colors and everyday things such as a spoon, dress, cat, etc. Since its a board book, we let our daughter play with it so she can practice turning pages and for the price, we dont mind her chewing on it. This book is one of  in a series and we highly recommend them for any parent and baby."
1,"Exactly as pictured Its bright, battery powered and really nice to look at. The base is about the size of an upside down foam dixie cup so it doesnt have a big footprint. For added fun, point an oscillating fan at it PDeducted one star because it doesnt have an AC adapter option. Not a big deal to me since I use rechargeable batteries but it might be an issue for some."
1,"The House on Mango Street The House on Mango Street written by Sandra Cisneres in her younger days is a wonderful set of Vignettes. The book is a good guide for young girls on how to live. The book shows the challenges women and Mexicans have achieving there dreams.The book is about a young girl named Esperanza who you can see turn from a girlto a woman. She is stuck on Mango Street and is anchored down by her family and her gender. In the end, she does alright but she never forgets the small red house on that street she grew up on.This book will always be on my bookshelf and should be on yours. The House on Mango Street is one of those books I can read over and every time find a new meaning to things. The book anchors me down to read it like Esperanza is anchored to her family. Overall it is a good book for all ages."
1,"A quick read Good book if you want further background on such characters as Alberich, Jadus, several others from the Talia books and subsequent novels of Valdemar and why Rolan never truly bonded with Talamir."
1,"WILL CONVINCE YOU NOT TO GO TO LAW SCHOOL! I would never even consider going to law school after reading this book. The excerpts from the authors diary enable readers to see through the veneer of prestige associated with largefirm law practices and understand what life is really like at a top law firm. For years, Ive been hearing that lawyers are often highly dissatisfied with their jobs and lives, despite the high salaries and professional prestige. Until I read this book, though, no one could effectively articulate the specific reasons WHY lawyers tend to be so unhappy other than the long hours they often work. This book finally fills that void by slowly building the case, chapter by chapter, against life in a large law firm. Through his diary entries, Keates does a fantastic job of describing not only why he is professionally and personally dissatisfied, but also HOW his dissatisfaction affects him over time."
1,"Excellent book for cake decorating! This is a great book in all respect, easy instruction that guide you from beginning to end to become a professional cake decorator. It is a most have book for anyone interesting in this beautifull art."
1,Great Stuff My dog was suffering from IBS or at least had very bad poops at least once a week. I started using this product about four months ago and I have noticed a  improvement. The directions say to give her two a day but I only give her one. I guess it depends on the dog. The one capsule works fine.
1,"More   continues to deliver full on action, with the usual twists and turns in the plot to keep us hooked. Keifer Sutherland remains at the centre of the action and his whatever it takes approach is debated by those in authority, with predictable results. Watching this on DVD makes it easier to keep track of everyone, rather than watching one show a week. If you liked the other series, youll like this one."
1,"An invaluable source book for The World of Darkness. Having played both Werewolf The Apocalypse and Vampire The Masquerade, I honestly didnt think too much about mage till a local person in my gaming group mentioned he ran Mage. So we all got together on a Friday night, and I was quiete impressed with the system. This book is a must have for any player or storyteller running The World of Darkness system. The book is very well written and offers insights on using mage either as standalone system or as part of The World of Darkness."
1,"How to Make a First Impression, by Jeremy Camp A very talented artist, Jeremy Camp makes a stunning debut with Stay. And with tracks such as Take My Life and In Your Presence, why wouldnt you want to stay? Camp is one of those few people who can make a big contribution to the music industry with only one album. I cant wait for the second."
1,"Brilliant Film. Why cant we buy it in England??? The Gods Must Be Crazy II was shown several years ago on our old Cable station, now taken over by Sky.We laughed at this film from start to finish. It is the sort of film you can watch over and over again, and laugh at the story every time you watch it.We are very disappointed as we cannot buy this film in England, we have spent months and months trying shops and internet sites and still we are unable to purchase this brilliant film.Maybe someone will read this message and be able to help us by advising were we can purchase not only this film but also The Gods Must Be Crazy.Come on  someone out there must realise that we in England would like to be able to purchase these titles and Im sure when they are available to us they will be snapped up quickly.Why not make them available on DVD. I would certainly purchaseboth films on Video and DVD."
1,"Penance Penance is the first Holland Taylor novel by David Housewright. This book won the Edgar Award for the Best First Novel. PI Holland Taylor has lost his wife and daughter to a drunk driver. When the driver of the car, John Brown, is found murdered, the police think Holland is the prime suspect. To clear his name, he begins to search for the real killer. Every avenue he looks into leads to C. C. Monroe, a candidate for the governor of Minnesota. The plot is rather complex, but I really liked the novel and the character of Holland Taylor who has some personal demons that he struggles to deal with. I especially enjoyed the parts with Ogilvy, his pet rabbit, because we own a male lopeared rabbit. This is an excellent debut novel, and I look forward to reading the next  Holland Taylor novels."
1,"good but mistitled This cd set is really informative and a good resource for centering prayer. It has very little on contemplative prayer. The first cd talks about our fallen nature. Centering prayer is used to clean out the junk of the false self. The rest is about the how and why of centering prayer. It is very useful but if you are looking for a resource on contemplative prayer specifically, this might not be it."
1,"Excellent The Outsiders special edition is what a special edition should be about. Its packed full of extras and previously deleted scenes. The new soundtrack is fascinating to listen to, although I think I prefer the original soundtrack, but even so, its great to see one of my favourite films look and sound so very different. Soda Pop Curtis played by Rob Lowe gets much more screen time in this edition. If youre a fan of the film this is worth a look."
1,"Different and exciting All you people who did not like this movie should go watch Contact again. I thought it was exciting and new, I mean why do we watch SciFi movies? To be entertained and thats hat this movie does!"
1,"Bruce Strikes Again! Brucio and his pseudo music stylings are back after a sevenyear absence. While not the caliber of Shamebased Man, DBP is still a great CD. It definitely wont appeal to everyone. This effort is dry, sarcastic, witty comedy at its best. If your looking for SNL style comedic garbage, look else where. Two things prevent me from rating this CD a five stars.  The disappointing title track.  The sheer fact that I cant rank it as equal or above Shamebased Man.If youre a KITH fan or a fan of sarcastic comedy buy this CD. Bruce Rules, I highly recommend it."
1,"Will delight musicloving audiences This collection of personal insights on pop music provides a series of essays and reflections on what makes good music, and what attracts listeners to music. Sprinkled within this firstperson observational are reflections on the art of music and the appreciation of various pop artists and styles which will delight musicloving audiences."
1,"Awesome but .... .... very nice scenery if you love rails and scenery. I did read a review prior to purchase that commented on the reflection of the trains windshield. I did not think it would make much of a difference, but had the windshield been  cleaned  prior to filming the P hidef would have been much sharper. It is very easy seeing the dirty windshield that reduces the image quality. Other than that, a very good DVD, very nice scenery."
1,"Cool Little Recorder This seems to be the recorder that everyone has in acoustic music. We use to all have the Sony minidisc, but it is a pain to use and you could never get it right. This is so easy. Just push the on button and hit the record button, adjust the levels if needed and hit the record button again and away you go. Still experiemting with the different quality of recording you can do, but it is easy to change. Sound quality is good. Even at a distance, like on the floor it will still pickup. Easy to plug in and copy to the computer, comes right into itunes or Audicity. Lightweight. Look cool"
1,"Funnier than the general review implies. I just had to respond to the main review of this book, which implied that this book was depressing, like talking to some hipster after an all night rave is there any other kind?. Dude, its our culture thats depressing, this book has the guts to look at the hideous reality of Gen Ecch and laugh in its face. It takes on TV Melrose and , in particular, literature youll never think seriously about Douglas Coupland again and alternative music with a razor sharp wit and enough condescension to make anyone feel a little more smug about themselves."
1,Rare Case  Movie beats Book hands down This is one of those rare cases where the film outclasses the book. Terrific performances and fantastic screenplay. I was taken over by the first  seconds and had to watch the rest.
1,"Not what expected, but served my purpose. First off, I didnt really know what to expect going in. I had read another review saying this ran off of DC power, but I was not really sure what this meant. When I received the package, it had two wires for power cables. Woah. Luckily, I tinker with this sort of thing, and recalled taking apart an old Airsoft Gun battery charger. Even more lucky, it was a v DC to AC adapter that charged my gun! How lucky! With a few snips, I scrapped the old charger, and with a little electrical tape, rigged up a makeshift power source. After that, this product works splendidly. The quality of the output is great, although it takes a little tinkering with these quality knobs above each output. Setup time with the whole power source ordeal was about  minutes. Well worth the time, as I can now record video from my XBOX  without having to play off a laptop screen! Recommended for those with minor electrical knowledge."
1,"Second purchase as a gift A family member saw us using this product and wanted one. She was so pleased with what she saw, that she got one as a Christmas gift, and she loves hers just like we do ours. Arrived promptly and filled the bill as a gift. She was pleased and so were we."
1,"Terrific book on Wall Street and Hedge Funds Having run a hedge fund and written about hedge funds, I was thrilled to read Barton Biggs Hedgehogging. Lots of insight into the different types of strange folks who running hedge funds and mutual funds and work on Wall Street. The stories are fun with lots of takeaways.Barton has always been a great writer. I worked with Barton Biggs at Morgan Stanley in the late s and early s when he ran Asset Management and even a stint at running research. His Monday essays in the Investment Perspectives were always a must read around the Street.I only wish Barton had filled us in on more personal anecdotes about the trials and tribulations of his own fund. Im hoping he keeps a diary and writes Hedgehogging the Sequel when hes done!"
1,really good movie for fans of horror and the friday the  ths go get this it is a good one to watch the only thing about the blu ray is that it does have quite a few blurry scenes. i dont know what they were thinking but they should have done a lil better.
1,"Perfect Protection This iPod protector works perfectly. I had the same problem a couple of reviewers discussed about the screen protector not fitting snug, so I turned it the other way and it fit like a glove!"
1,"Interesting read This book is about  successful businesses and how they got started. Although it does not contain details on how to start a business, it contains lots of good ideas and lots of inspiration, two important qualities of a entrepeneur. You will enjoy reading some better known businesses like Terra Chips as well as lesser known ones like Three Dog Bakery who makes gourmet biscuits for dogs. Its amazing a dog biscuit company makes over a million dollars a year, but since this book is about young millionaires, every company profiled in this book makes over this amount."
1,"Kudos! I find the product just perfect for my car. I liked the higher pitched sound and the shiny finish on it. Seller is honest and item was shipped fast and in exact sealed condition as listed. Price is reasonably fair and yes, seller is highly recommendable and so with product. Super buy and seller I must say!"
1,Return To Form After releasing some mediocre records in the early to mid s Sonic Youth returned to Sonic brilliance with this  release. Not quite as good as Sister or Daydream... but damn close and the amzing thing is that SY have the ability to release a great record years after their inception a feat that none of their peers have managed to pull off......get it now....
1,The Next Generation of the Pokemon Pokemon Crystal is one of the best Pokemon games in the whole pokemon saga. It is more challenging and it is really fun. My favorite part is that the pokemon that were really hard to find in other pokemon games are really easier to find now. The new things like the battle tower is really challenging and you must be ready. So ask your parents and get this game.
1,"My boys Two of my former employees are now writing films. The first was Joe Gayton for UNCOMMON VALOR. Now his brother Tony had the Salton Sea and Murder by Numbers. They worked for The Hollywood Star newspaper, filling the newsracks in Hollywood as they attended USC studying film. Both are ambitious and have become quite successful. Makes me feel good about them."
1,"Works perfectly and the cheapest price you will find  by far! My antenna had been acting up and losing the signal for several months before I finally decided it was time to replace the receiverI thought. After reading some of the reviews, I noticed that others had been having the same issues I was having getting the no signal message, and all they did was replace their antenna. Because of the huge price difference, I decided to buy this Belkin. It works perfectly. No more lost signal! I think my old antenna that came with the receiver was about  years old..."
1,One of our favorite movies!!! This is the greatest movie that Tom Selleck has ever made!!My husband has watched this movie at least  times. Now my grandson is a fan of Tom Selleck too. I ordered this video for him since he wanted his grandfathers copy and couldnt talk him out of it!!
1,"Great summary for the whole serious I have read the whole Black Medecine serious and thought that they were absolutly great. I enjoyed the first and the second volumes about the preasure points and the weapons at hand. I liked most of the third volume on low blows and different self defence techniques. Now this book is an exellent summary to all of them. I expected a book on how to kill someone, but instead Mashiro explains on how to use the weapons, techniques and preasure points to make your opponent submit with as little effort as posible. The techniques are effective and something that a none martial artist can use in a everyday life. They are simple and very usefull. I enjoyed the book and think it is a must in any self deffence library."
1,"Blue Divine is a celebration of hmmm, hmmm. With fingers gliding along a piano road of samba, blues, gospel and jazz heat, pianistcomposer Tammy Hall and her new CD, Blue Divine, just celebrate the definition of hmmm, hmmm.Jean Bartlett is the Arts Correspondent for the Pacifica Tribune"
1,"Sam Neill and Carpenter win the GOLD Stephen King should be proud of what John Carpenter and Sam Neill created from this epic horror classic. What a gem! I wont say anymore. Ya gotta see this. It is a fantastic psycho thriller...acting, script, editing and cinematography are of perfection. I enjoyed every second. FIVE stars!!!"
1,"Hillarious!! This is one of the great slapstick comedies of our time! Other than David Hyde Peirces performance, this was awsome. I think the greatest performance of all, however, was that of Chris Meloni! He plays the camp cookGene who has some MAJOR issues, but I wont spoil it for anyone by saying anymore. If you want some Laugh Out Loud, Rolling On The Floor, Side Spliting action, then this is the movie for you!!! Enjoy, I did!"
1,Great book to read Mcnaught has to be one of the greatest romance author I have ever encountered. Every book by her is just too good to put down till the end. I love it how she is able to combine humor and romance but at the same time never bore the readers. I love how I can relate to the characters through out the whole story ... its almost as if the characters are real and you wish that you cold be there with them or be them. Simply amazing.
1,"Grandson Books I bought this book for my younger Grandson, he is  mts, and he loves dogs. His mother reads to him every night and I love these books, I bought them also for my older grandson when he was younger. They are good reads and the drawings are amazings"
1,"Almost all Songs are Good! NO RAP! This was my first KoRn album and is one of my favorites. Ive had this cd for about  years now since it came out. There are  tracks on this album and only about  are bad. Some of my favorites are Somebody Someone, Wake Up, Counting, Dirty, the hit songs and more! If you want to get into KoRn buy this cd, dont buy Untouchables...! You wont regret buying this so just buy it or die. TIME Magazine says this album is so great If you know someone who doesnt like it, KILL THEM! Rolling Stones Magzine says Possibly more perfect than GOD!... well they didnt say that I just got that from MAD TV when it was making fun of the show Felicity. HAHA! MAD TV is a funny show, you should watch it sometime.Some other bands I like OzzyBlack Sabbath, Metallica, Slayer, Marilyn Manson, Slipknot, StaticX, RobWhite Zombie, Disturbed, System Of A Down, Tool,...stay away from Limp Bizkit and Linkin Park!"
1,"Great info for Disco owners If you own a Discovery, irrespective of the country you are in, you will get a lot of info from this book. The Author has researched it well, and covers all the issues I wanted to know about my vehicle. Some of the photos are great, I esp. like the convertible model  a shame they were never put that one into production  I want one of those! This is not a technical manual as such, but it still has a lot of facts  figures. It is also helpful if you are considering options from other models and want to see what they look like. I have an ES model, but would like to get the factory wheel arch flares, and I know what they would look like... Recommended for a Discovery or Land Rover enthusiast, or if you intend to purchase one and want to do your research."
1,"DVD PLEASE! This Hitchcock like suspense masterpiece featuring great performances, stunning black  white cinematography, and a Quincy Jones score needs to be on DVD now! Why in the world is it unavailable, even on VHS? Studio execs, make the right decision and give us Mirage!"
1,"This book got me reading again. This is one of best books that Ive ever read. Read it ifyou can handle tons of references to the Bible, Parzival anda lot of other material. It is about the possible existenceof a direct blood decendant of Jesus of Nazareth, and howthis has been maintained and kept secret throughout the last years. The writing is totally sobering. The implicationsof course are staggering.Critical reading for everyone!"
1,"Sacred Marriage This is the best book I have ever read on marriage. It is a practical, biblical view of marriage. I think for many who read this book the light will turn on in their head that God designed marriage to help us grow not just for our personal fulfillment."
1,"This a keeper. I have never done a review on a product, but I feel I must review about this product. I live in a Townhome with an enclosed patio  x . Leaves often blow into the patio and I have flowering plants that drop their flowers. I can easily remove all debris in  to  minutes and also sweep my driveway. I purchased an additional battery pack for larger jobs, but so far have not had to switch out when sweeping. If you do have to switch out the battery pack for longer jobs, it is easy and convenient."
1,"Stop spinning your wheels Strongly recommend this book for anyone who feels heshe is constantly spinning their wheels and never getting out of lifes occasional mud pit.Most all of the chapters provide reallife examples of people both famous and maybe not so famous whove taken a disappointing situation or life obstacle and instead of playing the victim, have become the victor.The introduction contains excellent redefinitions of failure and success.This is a book Ill keep to reread when faced with another one of lifes wheelspinning challenges."
1,"Revoltingly Pleasant! This masterpiece is a punk classic. Not only will the guitar riffs rumble throughout your very existance, the highly offensive vocals of the lead singer will pierce even the most honorable mans moral.A must have for anyone who can hear."
1,"Code Talker For anyone interested in World War II, andor the Code Talkers, this is an outstanding book. I liked that the author, Judith Schiess Avila, wrote the book in first person, as Chester Nez told his story to her. I have been aware of the Code Talkers for many years and have read many articles about them, but to have a first hand account was amazing. Thank You, Judy and Chester"
1,"Not your usual historical novel This is a terrific novel,and not only because it has a gripping plot which it does it has that rare quality which I can only, for lack of a better word, call worldcreation. A great deal of historical fiction, however painstakingly researched, reminds one more than anything of other historical fiction. Holmans book doesnt it gives you a sense of place, a sense of things happening  with a kind of doomed intensity  in that place, which seems completely original. Ive done enough reading in the area to know that this book is very accurate about its historical sources body snatching, the cholera epidemic in the area. But what I loved about the book was how little that mattered  just how caught up I was in the world the writer created.Im saying too much this is a great read!"
1,"Exceeded Expectations I ordered these jeans for my husband. They are a perfect fit for him, came in a timely manner, are good quality, and were a great price! We are overall very pleased with this purchase."
1,"I Love my Flowbeebut not from Amazon!!! I love my Flowbee that I purchased in ! It does great work and I go to a salon twice a year to get a professional cut and Flowbee inbetween. Amazon offers it at , but if you go to flowbee.com it is ., the same price I paid in ..... years ago!"
1,I adore these These are so good. By far the favorite protein bar Ive tried. The chocolate chocolate chip is my fav flavor with the chocolate peanut butter a close second. I eat them X a week before I meet with my personal trainer. They are nice and big and really are a great snack for  calories
1,"A fun, quick read This is a book that you can finish in a few hours prior or enroute? to your next trip to Vegas. It covers the story of a team from MIT that for a time beat the house in Vegas and other casinos.Its a lively adventure that explains the techniques used in an easy to understand manner. It also covered why these might not be valid anymore. For a book thats about beating the system, it accurately captures the reality that eventually the casinos always catch up.Not fine art or higher literature, but a fun read."
1,This will make you love Christmas a little more Typical smooth Cetera sound covering some holiday standards and a few bits of new material. The band sounds good and not over powering like you tend to hear on some Christmas music. I thought everything blended together quite well. Really like the new material. Can actually visualize the thing that santa claus left behind changing colors. Hopefully his new material will be part of the old standards by the time my kids grow up. Okay Peter  time for Ceteras Christmas part .
1,"Ma Nda La is a lovely book for early readers. My daughter understood the concept of reading through this lovely little book. That was in , and having lost the book, I have been searching for it for years for the next generation. The poem, illustration and content were inspirational to our family. I highly recommend that it be reintroduced."
1,"Great Choice for Triple Monitors I have this stand running   Samsungs. The Outside monitors are standing vertical, then center monitor is horizontal. I couldnt get through my day with out being a web designer. Very easy to use, adjust height  width, and orientation of the monitors. Two thumbs up for me.Its one of my favorite parts to my computer. Cant say enough great things about it."
1,"I love these solar landscape lights...! I purchased  sets of these lights to use as uplighting around the front of my home. I am impressed with the amount of light that these put out and how easy they are to install. Not enough to shine through the windows to disturb the darkness but a nice glow to illuminate the landscape. I am going to order  more sets for each side, they look kind of bare compared to the front. They are in no way as bright as the electic powered lights but they are just as pretty. I put them out today and a couple of my neighbors approched me this evening and asked me who did your lighting..."
1,Pretty Good First Album. . . I really like this album although it is totally pop music Mandy Moore has a talent and hopefully her next albums will show more of it.Song Ratings.So real .Candy ..What You Want .Walk Me Home .Lock Me In Your Heart .Telephoneinterlude.Quit Breaking My Heart .Let Me Be The One ..Not Too Young .Love Shot .I Like It .Love You For Always .Quit Breaking My Heart reprise
1,"Not Quite Star This is a great collection, but I cant rate it as high as THE KEY CD or HIGH LONESOME SOUND. This one includes Gills classics, Dont Let Our Love Start Slippin Away, One More Last Chance,  the ballads Nothing Like a Woman, Tryin to Get Over You,  the title track. Most of the ballads here are nice, but I wouldve preferred more variety like there is on THE KEY. Pretty Words is also a nice upbeat, bluegrassy tune. This CD is definitely worth getting, but if youre looking for your first Vince collection, I would go with the other two first."
1,"Are you kidding me, only  for all this? I did countless hours of research on Digital cameras before settling on the A. I cant stress enough how impressed I am with all of the As features for only . Picture quality is great, lcd viewer is easily viewable, multiple settings, and manual control of focus, exposure and shutter speed, plus movie mode!. Takes awesome pictures in near complete darkness with flash on...in focus and vibrant colors.Cons None really, considering the price but if I had a choice I would like the movie length to be only limited by the size of the sd card, instead of  minutes, also to be able to adjust zoom level in movie mode. However, I consider this a camera with the added bonus of  minute movies, if I had wanted something for movies more than pictures I would have purchased something else.If you want an awesome digital camera at a lower end price...look no further, you can find cheaper, but not with these features and quality."
1,Underappreciated This game is very underappreciated by the people who claim it is just another platformer. I almost believed it too but after reading the reviews I decided on buying it. This is one of the greatest games of all time. The story mode is imaginative and the online mode is the most fun youll ever have online with a playstation . Buy this game and see what youve been missing!!!
1,"Beautifully Done The story of hester is by itself a master piece worthy of its highly commended status, however the annotated version really helps the reader understand the historical references and many archaic words."
1,"I have a lot of trouble taking aspirin ... I have a lot of trouble taking aspirin since it usually gives me stomach pains. This Bayer aspirin gave me none. Unfortunately, the dosage was so low I had to take twice as many as regular aspirin to achieve the same pain relief. Im not sure how this balances out."
1,Lilias is the best teacher out there..... I grew up watching Lilias on TVPBS when she had a long braid.I purchased this video a while ago and I have since begun to use it. Yes!!! Lilias talks but thank god she is taking time to explain in full what your body should fell like. I have one other video by her but I hope to purchase more in the future. Her teaching style is for everybody....
1,"One of my favorite things by Clamp Any real anime fan has at least heard one thing about Clamp. Their unique and catchy storylines, beautiful artwork, and unforgetable characters. I dont love everything by Clamp, however,a few series by them I absolutly adore  Wish, X, Chobits, while some that really werent for me Magic Knight Rayeartth, Card captor Sakura However, I bought this boxed set, and was pleasently surprised by this series.I wont get into the plot because its already stated, but I will just say that this is now one of my favorite things by Clamp because of . Icchan Hee hee!  Gotta love his penalties. Positive message. Amazing fighting scenes with the angels. Wonderful charactersAnd I will just warn you, episode  will probably have you bawling. hahahaa, i was bawling anyway. xD"
1,"VERY HELPFUL I bought this game and game guide for my husband last year for his birthday, he LOVES it. In the game it gives you the chance to pick if the bard will be snarky or nice, and depending on what you pick will vary the outcome of the game, and the plot. He has replayed the game serval times. Who doesnt love a game where you can be nasty to a person that deserves it? The game guide was a help for finding routes, the map was a blessing and it has all of the locations of the secrets. worth the money I spent for the guide and shipping. It was delievered nicely, not damaged, and on time. I was thrilled!! This game is not for children, it is a bit too violent, for teens it would be okay. A great game and a must have guide."
1,"Very Good Shaver If You Use It Right... Ive been using this shaver for about a month and I am fairly happy with it. Ive owned  Panasonic shavers over the past  years and I find them to be the best for tough beards like mine. Ive tried Braun, Remington, and Wahl and have never been happy with their performance. This shaver works great if you know how to get the most out of it. Ive learned over the years that there are three things that are important to getting a good shave with an electric razor  . Keep the shaver clean. This is made very easy with this shaver since it has a combo charging  cleaning base. . Wash and dry your face BEFORE shaving. This will make your whiskers stand up and easier to cut. . Press LIGHTLY on your face with the shaver on the first pass. If you still have any stubborn whiskers, then press harder until you have a clean shave. If you follow these steps, Im sure youll be as happy with this shaver as I am."
1,"stars, because . wont do The Detroit Cobras obviously love their record collection which must be very large and full of delightful obscurities from many decades. All their records are freshly recreated cover versions and here they tackle in order Melvin Smith a local singer, the Olympics, Gloria Jones, the Kingston Trio, the  Royales, Dorothy Love Coates NinetyNine And A Half Wont Do not the Wilson Pickett song, as so many reviewers seemed to think and Koko Taylor, all played with passion and verve. To make it harder to fathom their origins, they change or missspell some of the song titles or composer credits or omit them completely so some detective work went into finding the above list of names, but this is part of their charm. Great stuff"
1,"splendens! indoles! ingens! brilliant, genius, remarkable Have you ever asked yourself, who did the Romans think they were? Well, look no further. In this brilliant exploration of Ciceronian rhetoric, John Dugan opens the door to much more than just a great orator. He opens very gates of Rome itself.It is without hyperbole that I predict that this remarkable and paradigmshifting exploration of Rome is destined to become a classic which will find a place of prominence in classics classses and reading lists for a generation.It is, undoubtedly, a triumph."
1,"Worth Reading Mary Anns heart harbors love for the golden stranger who saved her familys Christmas when she was fourteen. Seven years later they meet again. His name is Lionel St. James and he is totally unsuitable for her. He is a rogue, a gambler, despoiler of innocents! Through the eyes of love, Mary Ann sees him as her misunderstood hero and sets out to make everything right. After ten years of debauchery, Lionel finds Mary Ann and her large extended family a balm for his wounded heart and soul.The story follows the usual Regency path. Violence against one woman is glossed over  but for most of the characters a happy ending is achieved."
1,"Very Good Customer Service My wife and I bought the  slice version of this toaster, and we liked it so much we gave it away and ordered the  slice model. We were disappointed when it arrived and the egg cooker didnt work. I called the company and then sent another one, no questions asked, without having to sent the first in.Now we use it everyday to make delicious and healthy sandwiches. The only complaint is that the toaster doesnt make toast very dark, even on the highest setting, but it isnt bad, and you can put the toast in twice if it really bothers you. I would recommend this to everyone to make simple and delicious sandwiches."
1,"honest on my life, this is THE best book Seriously. I had never read one Francine Rivers book in my life before Redeeming Love. I had never even heard of the author! Now, I am here, on Amazon, searching for and buying up every single Francine Rivers book I can lay my hands on. Redeeming Love was simply incredible. I started it Saturday morning, finished it Saturday night. In the course of one week, following that Saturday, I have completely finished her Mark of the Lion trilogy, and now am more convinced of her extreme talent for literature. I HIGHLY recommmend this book. It makes you feel every emotion to your very core. Humor, Sorrow, Pain, Sympathy, and Sheer Joy just flow from the words on the page! Just Wow. I mean, WOW.  Two words buy it"
1,Great product Rainbows make great sandals and the double layer heel makes them extra comfy. Look good and feel even better. This is my rd pair of Rainbows but the first time Ive worn the double layer and its awesome.
1,"Same book different cover This is exactly the same book, just a different cover, Hawk vs the vampire, and the murder in the sorcerer gaunts house, god killer, and the one with the politician hardcastle, it is just a different cover. I returned it for a refund."
1,"Ive Always Wanted This! After using the internet for aerial views, I had dreamt that such a book would come out. When I saw this book, I had to have it. Beautifully detailed aerial images of ALL NEW YORK CITY! The outer boroughs are included. See your house, or use the book to research the route of mass transit lines. I use the book primarily for that, as I am a train buff. But, if you just want to get a bettrer idea of your neighborhood and your city, you must get this book. Thick, glossy pages, and made wonderfully. Kudos to whover allowed this book to be released, especially in these times we live in."
1,"Beautiful Galileo Thermometer I had wanted one of these thermometers for a long time just because they are so pretty, and not for the practical use as much. I wasnt sure if it would actually work or if it would make it through the mail in one piece. I received a gift certificate and was trying to decide what to get and then I remembered to check my wish list and I had put one of these on it a long time ago. I checked out the various ones available and this one was the right price and had a lot of the inner globes in it so I ordered it. It arrived unbroken and I was completely pleased with the quality and workmanship of the item. It has a very sturdy bottom of thick glass so its weighted and wont tip over. You do occasionally have to tilt it and put it upright again to get the globes to move into place so that the right temperature shows but thats no big deal. I really love this and enjoy just looking at the beautiful colors of the liquid globes inside. I highly recommend this."
1,"Great baseball cap rack! My husband is using this as a baseball cap hat rack and it works perfect for this. I plan to paint it, but that hasnt happened yet. With all the caps on it, you can hardly see it. Perfect!"
1,"Great SATA Hard Disk I recommend this Hard Disk to everyone, since its pretty fast, flawless, not noisy, easy to install and configure at a so cheap price. I have been using it for  months already, and I really love it ! Great decission !"
1,"Excellent reference! Excellent reference! There are few mistakes, which are not critical. Photograph on p.  shows engineer troops officer not a motorized rifleman, as Author states, who is wearing the appropriate branch insignia on his tunic collar. Photograph on p.  shows wheeled BTRPB APC not BMP IFV. The abbreviation SF p.  is not for Sovietskiy flot Soviet Navy, but Severniy Flot. Northern Fleet. Soviet navy included and the Russian Navy still includes Baltic Sea Fleet, Black Sea Fleet, Northern Fleet and Pacific Fleet. The unnamed helmet on pp.  is at least its current modification KZ  Kaska Zashchitnaya  protective helmet and was intended to use both for crowd control as Author has mentioned and in fire service where it still has some use."
1,"Good daily carry knife. I have carried this knife for a few years as a daily utility blade. The opening mechanism is efficient, and the blade adequately sharp with good edge retention. The retention clip does well at retaining the knife in a pocket or similar, and went through three years of daily carry and moderate use before the clip screws loosened once loosened, however, they were fully unscrewed and lost within  hours. The knife is still my daily carry blade, and will be a little more comfortable once I reattach the retention clip."
1,"This is a rubber world The book is well researched and sheds some light on one of the most important , while least famous, scientific discovery of our time the modern rubber processing.While telling this story, the author does also a great job in portraying with vivid colors some aspects of the life and society of  America.Goodyear devotes his existence to study and modify the behavior of the rubber and during this pursuit endures poverty, frequent prison stints and health deterioration. But most of all he neglects completely the needs of his family, spending all his money on rubber research.While Mr Slack defines Goodyear as an  obsessed  man I think a more correct definition could be closer to mental illness.The book spends quite some space in describing the legal fights between the key players involved with patents regarding rubber processing, and I found these sections not very interesting. stars."
1,"Fitness Video not a Bellydance Instructional Ive been bellydancing for  years and got what I wanted with these videos. I wanted a good conditioning video that would help maintain and improve my strength. Thats what Suhaila provided. I would not recommend these videos to someone that is looking to either learn basic bellydance technique or never taken any bellydance before. Instead, these videos are perfect for the bellydancer who wants to condition their body OR someone with previous dance training."
1,"good book I like this book. It is hard to find books on how to make swimsuits and leotards, but this one has lots of great information, and the instructions are pretty easy to follow. It comes with some good patterns too."
1,"Awesome Scope for the Money After buying other cheap scopes and being disappointed, I picked this one up. Once I got it zeroed to  yards I was consistently placing kill shots at range. The scope is very easy to use and the variable zoom works great. I dont really need the illuminated crosshairs, but they do look cool and are probably great for low light shooting. I would recommend this scope to anyone on a budget who needs a decent scope."
1,"Wheres the rest of the concert? While this is indeed a good CD, it is only half the concert. The rest of the concert which I have on the original  LP and a  LP reissue is even better, even though Hamp is only on the first numberStardust. However, it is that recording of Stardust that is perhaps the greatest version of the song ever recordedespecially Hamps solo. But hes paired with such stars as Barney Kessel, Charlie Shavers, Slam Stewart, Willie Smith on alto, etc. sort of a JATP sound and the crossinspiration of the stars is incredible. The other three long tracks are the AllStars without Hamp, which are just as swingingif I remember correctly the tracks are Lady Be Good and One OClock Jump I cant remember the last one. Apparently this was issued on CD briefly, but its out of print. Someone ought to put these two together as a CD set and present the entire concert togetherit will be an incredible evening recreated."
1,"OEM product  true! Based on the other reviews, I was worried that I might not get genuine HP cartridges. Since the cheap cartridges I bought last time didnt last very long, I wanted to get the real thing. The cost about  seemed to indicate they would be HP brand, not generic. They were! So Im giving  stars since its the OEM product and not  stars, because its still more expensive than it should be.It seems that at least in my case, theyve worked out the issue of these being HP versus another brand. Lets just hope they last me a while!"
1,"the Trial of God This book is very thought provoking. May not be suitable for children other than HS level because of its sophistication. The more one knows about the Bible, the better one will relate to the arguments used. But it is not necessary to be a master of the subject. Traditional believers may have a problem with the ideas presented."
1,"But very large and very heavy when full Looks sturdy and functional, but . . .My bad for not looking closely at the dimensions . . . this feeder is humongous. Almost two feet tall and very heavy when full. You need a big tree with a sturdy branch. I bought it for my little dogwood and there is no branch high enough or sturdy enough to hang this. Ive now put it up in the backyard on a silver maple and I live in fear that it will somehow detach and kill the dog.LATER Works fine, with adjustable weight mechanism that can be used to block squirrels and even larger birds. With five feeding ports, the birds are gobbling down impossibly large amounts of bird seed. I believe I have attracted every bird in a five mile radius and the trees around my property are eerily populated, in scenes reminiscent of a Hitchcock film. I have taken out a second mortgage on my home in order to afford a subscription to regular deliveries of bird seed, because I am afraid of what may happen to me if I stop feeding them."
1,"Was exactly what I was promised This book is obviously preowned and that is exactly what I was promised. I got this book for a school project and it is perfect for it. The condition is good and all I needed was for it to be readable, which it was. Once I am done with the project I can definitely read it again, it is perfect obviously used, but thats what I wanted. Its great for what I needed."
1,"A definitive Superman II! Superman The Movie was a great film, but to me, the sequel most of which was shot concurrently with the first film, was great at some points and not so great at others. Then I later discovered that the reason was due to there being two directors and a lot of the scenes I had a beef with were shot by Richard Lester not Richard Donner, who was fired after the first films premier. Most painful to watch was the Clark Kent tripping scene and the Lois Lane Niagra Falls jump scene.And then theres the stunning lack of Marlon Brando as JorEl. A decision that was made to save money. Thankfully, that has been rectified.Amazingly, Dick Donner and Michael Thau were able to recut the film using footage that was thought to be lost and did a whale of a job.And fittingly, Superman II The Richard Donner Cut, is dedicated to Christopher Reeve."
1,"Classic book covering the concepts and techniques of racing The timeless book which has taught hundreds of racing enthusiasts to exceed their expectations and conquer the race track. Although this book was originally written  years ago, there are few books which detail the techniques and concepts behind motor racing so clearly. This is definately a book that belongs on every true racing enthusiasts bookshelf."
1,"Boys ballet dvd Not a lot out there for boys about ballet if they want to practice at home. All of the childrens ballet dvds I have seen are only girls. This one is just a little off putting due to the dated look. With male dancers around like Bolle, one would hope that something a little more modern and technique oriented could be made for boys who are interested in learning ballet."
1,"Classic Tales  a must! Every childs home library should have this whimsical book in it. The edition has great illustrations, and is full of common sense wisdom and philosophy. Dont pass it up! Bess Kuzma"
1,Great!! This is such a good book! The example sentences and the cultural notes are great. And the appendices contain some very helpful information! Ever wanted to know what your name would be in Chinese?
1,"Great Intermediate Level C Material If you have C skills of no less then an advanced beginner, and want to find yourself securely in the intermediate range, then you have found the right book. Read it once and you will find your skill set drastically improved. Read it twice and study it thoroughly, and you will find yourself getting turned to for help from your more senior developers. Quite the ego booster.Its well written, has appropriate examples for the target audience, and doesnt get bogged down in beginning C material. It has plenty of advanced material, if that is what you are looking for."
1,"Nice entrylevel camera This camcorder is nice for the amateur or anyone looking for an inexpensive camera. The variablespeed zoom and fadeswipes are features that can add a professional touch. It is light enough to take anywhere, and has a long enough battery time to withstand the long haul, unless youre planning on filming a lowbudget movie with it Blair Witch?. I enjoy this device, but I would urge anyone with a bit more cash to go for a higherend model."
1,"Quintessential Miller. If I had to choose one work by Miller that explains why heis the greatest living comic book artist writer, this wouldbe it.His economical and powerful lines are the very definition ofart as communication. He has a better internal sense of formand figure than  of todays artists, and he tells a terrificstory in words as well.Some of the breakout pages in the original book series arejust awesome, humbling showcases of talent and creativity.Anything Ive ever learned about drawing, inking, framing apose, shortening my lines, bolding others, comes from his workin this series. I appreciate it on so many levels, but strictlyas a reader, this is his finest achievement."
1,Please stop comparing this show to the original!!!! First off this is a seperate movie from the original. Also as much as I love Gena Rowlands I did not like the original Gloria so I dont see everyones fascination with it. On its own I thought this show was great. I saw it on tv very early in the morning so my expectations were low. And I am not a very big fan of Sharon Stone at all but I was very presently surprised by this show. Personally I think this is one of her best roles and I thought she did it wonderfully. I think you should give this show a shot based on its own merits alone. Its not the best movie ever but its definitely not the worst either. So basically its touchingheartwarming and has some good action and definitely worth at least a once over so take a chance and may you also be pleasently surprised.
1,"Good Easy Listening CD Dont judge a CD by its cover. That would definitely apply here. The cover art would seem to suggest either rap or reggae music but neither would be the case here. All the selections on Sun of Jamaica are in the same easy listening vein as Guantanamera though that particular song is not included on this CD. Favourite selections on this CD would be the title song Sun of Jamaica, Seven Tears and Rain, though the rest of the CD is just as pleasant to listen to. If you want some mildly lively, easy on the ears music, give this CD a spin."
1,Perfect for traveling! i LOVE this travel steamer. I take it with me on my international business trips and it works great on my suits. The best part is that it comes with adapters that you can use on your other electronics as well.
1,"Somewhat technical herb book This book makes a good reference book for herbalists and people interested in botanicals. Divided into herb sections, the author bases the information on scientific research rather than folk lore which sometimes verifies the the long standing beliefs about particular herbs."
1,"Dave takes Watchtower to another level Though almost every track on this CD is good the exception being Halloween, which remained weak even on Before These Crowded Streets, its really Daves cover of Dylans All Along the Watchtower that is the most impressive aspect of this live acoustic recording. Its amazing how so many others have improved on Dylans song, this being not just the most RECENT !, but also the best Ive heard so far. I also agree with other reviewers who mention that other DMB versions are better than those appearing here e.g. Dancing Nancies, Warehouse, but these versions are still great, especially if you prefer a more strippeddown sound."
1,"Easy Enough for the Network Newbie  Good Enough for the Pro For those of you that are just starting out, or who want something of high quality, with a very straightforward setup, and want a good value to boot, then this is what you need. I bought this to set up my first home network because it came highly recommended by my local techie. He has it personally and also installed it for my office peertopeer network. My level of computing knowledge is a high average I can build my own computers, but Im selftaught and dont always know about the latest and greatest without researching it. I used the printerserver, which was a nice bonus and Im currently using it with  computers. Ive had the unit for at least six months and have had no problems whatsoever and dont expect any. Dont hesitate on this one. If you can set up your own network, then this is almost too easy!"
1,"Best horror movie of  this is by far the best movie i have seen this year. This movie was scarier than Insidious. This movie is ranked up with paranormal activity and blair witch. If you like the mtv show fear your going to love this movie and even if you never watch it, its still a really scary movie. check it out i thought it was very well done."
1,charming and addictive Take a break from all the high budget special effects movies and enjoy a wonderfully charming movie with a heart and a brain. Its not your typical sugary sweet romance. Instead were given a treat of quick and funny dialogue exchanges and a suspense factor that will keep you hooked til the end. Listening to a couple argue had never been so much fun. Tomei and DOnofrio are great. I rented the movie on Netflix.com and couldnt bring myself to return it until I had my own copy.
1,"Good quick workout I ordered this DVD as most people do to tone up for my upcoming wedding. Most of the segments are  minutes, great for when you are short on time but still want to get a workout in. You can also select which chapters you want to use for a custom designed workout which is great. You do need some light weights in order to do the workouts properly... I have been using books instead of real weights! Will probably get sick of it after a few months but I think that happens with all workout DVDs!"
1,"Works wonderfully! Makes my hair silky smooth. Very easy to handle. Does not burn my hands like those I bought from the drugstores. Very happy with it. So far, have good faith in BaByliss products. Bought this because I tried the BaByliss Pro TT hairdryer, which is the best ever!"
1,"The onetwo punch... On the internet there are always debates about how could mankind be taken out? Most agree that it would take two major disasters to bring us down. Because of our machines, our science, our intelligence we could not be taken out by a war or a supergerm...but if two things, two great events happened on top of one another...yes, maybe we would be taken down a few pegs.Well before the internet, well before any of these debates, was The Furies by Keith Roberts. Giant wasps appear about the same time we do something really stupid  nuclear tests crack the Earths crust like an egg shell. The landscape was changed, cities destroyed and new oceans formed where there were none.Now that mankind is down there comes the kick in the side  the wasps attacks!Where did they come form and why are they here? You see, they seem to be able to think also. And unlike man they dont really need machines  or do they?"
1,"Fantastic I went to see the movie to see how the director and producer would treat it. Ive read the book numerous times, and wondered if the packaging would do it justice. It did. There were a couple of scenes missing in the movie like the turkey trap, but overall this was excellent. The movie contained the same emotional impact as the book."
1,"The Dogs Mind. I was very happy with the price and condition of this book when I recieved it. I needed this book for one of my classes dog behavior and training. It was being sold for  but I found it here for .. it looks and feels new, there is almost no wear on the book. I am very happy with this product."
1,"Disheartening, sad treatise of the Viet Nam War... ... but a tale properly told.While I wasnt a grunt in Viet Nam, I was a Marine and could identify with all the emotion of this saga.The only thing I would take issue with is Cupotos treatment of anyone who outranked him. There were a lot of good high ranking line and staff officers in Viet Nam to go with the type Cupoto describes. Its a shame he couldnt give them a fair shake.Its a shame things turned out as they did in Viet Nam. The Domino Theory was as valid in the beginning and real reason for concern. It turned into crummy war fought by some very good men. Its a shame that their efforts, patriotism and heroism are not fully appreciated."
1,"beautiful looks and sound This was my primary mic for a long time. Picks up sound in the mids beautifully and true. I was a bit surprised by how well it picked up because of the price, but it is a mainstaple in my microphone arsonal. Great for studio recording. I run it through a preamp not a board"
1,"Short mens bike shorts These are the shortest mens bike shorts I have found.The fit is perfect and have neat little side pockets near the waist.The padding is a little light, but remember they are only tri shorts."
1,"Pleased I cant believe i am watching this again!, i used to watch it back at the end of the th when i was only , i used to come from kindergarden ad turn on the T.V black and white to watch superman. I used to watch it spanish, now that i speak English i can hear their real voicesLooking forward buying the other series"
1,"Making the Connections This book is one of feminisms most unread classics. Griffin made the connections before Lacan and Butler to all the uses Western religion and philosophy has used language and dichotomies to bolster the power of men over women and nature. Her analysis is brilliant, clear, and persuasive. Read in conjunction with ecofeminist analysis, Griffin shows the necessary connections between the abuse of nature and the abuse of women through a rhetorical analysis that remains unmatched in its creativity, prose, and pertinance."
1,"Excellent Product! Excellent product, excellent price! In addition, would like to thank Amazon for prompt response to our complaint regarding the original shipment the first item we ordered arrived with multiple dents on the sides, but after we contacted Amazon weve been taken care of immediately. Our replacement item arrived the next day and the same UPS truck picked up the damaged item  WHAT A SERVICE!!!"
1,"Even the Rat Was White A Historical View of Psychology I read this book as a psychology major in the late s. It was facinating then and timely. Now it is even more so. The perspectives it shares are critical to understanding racism in its full capacity. Racism is not merely a side issue or cultural anomaly, it is the centerpiece of American life and European culture in general. It goes beyond simply naming behaviors as racist or nonracist. It allows you to understand and label the components of racism and to understand the mechanisms of the disorder. Only then can you cure yourself and help others."
1,"Good, but horrible mistakes in the Hindi titles. I had an extremely dim first impression of the book from the chapter titles. The book attempts to transliterate an english word into a Devnagari Hindi script, and fails spectacularly. Transliterating back, the word spices reads as syasis, Canned goods reads as can thruds and so on. It clearly has been added as a touch of exotica, which annoys me more.This rant is only applicable to the Hindi reading section of the Indian populace, who in any case wont need this book to enter an Indian grocery store.Thank you for letting me get that off my chest. Now I can be kind to the book.I am an Indian it seems relevant in this context since none of the other reviewers so far are. The information in this book is actually quite good, and pretty comprehensive, and for that Id recommend the book. The indexing needs to be fixed at the very least all the nonEnglish words in the text should be present."
1,"SPELLBOUND! Fans of romantic suspense divas like Victoria Holt and Mary Stewart must rediscover Dorothy Eden, especially Winterwood, a book that I shall never forget. Full of vivid characters, and written in a clear, fastmoving style, it will keep you on the edge of your seat and make you giggle endlessly at times. Excellent reading. I am going to read all of Ms. Edens books and I am sure I am in for a treat!"
1,"Amazing! Matt Napier must be some sort of genius because Ive never seen a more beautifully written childrens book since The Giving Tree. Not to mention, the illustrations which are absolutely fabulous. Melanie Rose is truly a great artist. Get this book hot off the press because its going fast!Ive purchased several copies for Christmas gifts and I cant wait until Matt Napier breaks into the childrens world again with another beautiful and informative book."
1,"It Literally is The Best of Luna I used to make compositions on casset tapes of only my favorite songs from many different albums. As part of the process of updating my collection with CDs, I find The Best of Luna by Luna almost matches my tape of favorites. This saved me a lot of time and money."
1,JR has done it again I thought Jrs first album was good this one is out of this world. the girl keeps getting better and better. Jr has a soothing but agressive sound. The words in her material stimulates your senses. I love the C.D. I listen to it over and over again and each time it feels me with emotion. She is definately an up comming star. Her live performance is even more breath taking..... a must have C.d to add to your collection of music...VERETTA
1,"Wow Since living in South Korea for the last   years, I found I understood the book a lot better than I would have before this but still found things that helped me understand the people better."
1,The Journal of William Thomas Emerson Have you ever wanted to live in Revolutionary War times?Maybe to be a spy? Because I would recommend this book to anyone who has a sense of adventure. William the main character is a orphen and is token in by a cavern keeper in Bosten. He always decided to go on missions and spy on British. I would also recommend this book to someone who wishes she or he had no parents.
1,"Nice Watch Its a pretty decent watch, I was looking for a watch with a swiss movement under a , the dial is a little bulky but overall i think the watch is pretty sharp, it looks just like a tag hauer."
1,"Great Homage To The Originals My family are all  Stooges fans and this movie was very well done. It was written, acted and directed just like the original Stooges shorts even breaking the movie into  shorts that told the whole story. The actors all played their parts just like Moe, Larry and Curly without trying to put their own stamp on it. I didnt think it was possible, but I enjoyed this movie as much as any of the original classics."
1,jeremy holloway probally one of the greatest rock and roll albums out there from  to  ted released some of the greatest rock this album proves why rock and roll will never die i give this cd  stars a must have
1,"Hank Coming Back This is Hank Williams, Jrs best since Lone Wolf back in . Honky Tonked All to Hell is a typical, rowdy, foot stomping, Bocephus tune which rivals Hotel Whiskey from a few years ago. Also, It Makes a Good Story is a tune written by Hank that shows he not all drinking and partying. The best track on the CD is Lets Keep the Heart in the Country, another Bocephus original which could be a big hit if another artist recorded it."
1,"Excellent Shades For Your Home!! I cant believe the value we got with the Lewis Hyman Pecan Havana Bamboo shades. My wife and I visited several stores in Sarasota, Fl, where shades are sold. We saw nothing suitable for under . As a last resort, we searched the Amazon site and spotted these shades. We immediately ordered two, for our front bay window.Since Im a member of Amazon Prime, we got free day shipping. It took us maybe  minutes to install them. They look absolutely beautiful. I highly recommend these shades, especially at this low price."
1,"Soft Hair Sleek look makes my wild hair a little calmer. I have been using it for many years, and I like to try other products, but this is a staple for me because it works soo soo well. It keeps my hair healthly, with minimal buildup."
1,my kid is obsessed with butterflies My  year old has been obsessed with butterflies since he was  years old. He loves butterfly toys. I love butterfly toys. This one does not get  stars because it was tough to figure out which butterfly was which species once out of the box. The colors are a bit off compared to the real thing. Otherwise a nice set.
1,Incredible tasting water This thing is amazing. I have pretty good water to start with but wanted to clean it up more to use in one of those expensive expresso coffee machines. This takes ordinary water and turns it into something hard to describe. The water coming out truly taste amazing. I wish they made a larger reservoir as it seems like I am always filling it up. The price is a bargain for what you get. The filter should last me around  months at my rate of consumption. Very happy consumer here.
1,"Great Introduction This book is very strong  out of  for Calculus II, namely in the areas of indeterminant forms and improper integrals, polar coordinates, sequences and series, vectors, parametric coordinates, and graphing. It is pretty strong  in the areas of partial derivatives and integration of many variables. In vector fields, How to Ace the Rest of Calculus is sketchy. It covers divergence and curl well, as well as the basics about vector fields. However, the book does not do very well  in explaining the finer points in vector fields, such as Line and Surface Integrals, Greens Theorem, and Stokes Theorems, in which more examples would be useful. If a problem arises in line or surface integrals including Greens and Stokes Theorems, dont look to this book to clear it up.I would recommend this book purely as the authors intended, an introductionnothing more and nothing less."
1,"Please, please, please reprint this book! I chanced upon an old and muchthumbed copy of this book in a library in India. It was and is the best book I have seen on studying, not just for students, but for anyone who needs to master understand, organize and retain a large amount of information. The operative word here understand. It helped me in cutting through the chaos of my research notes. The joke is, it is written for School kids in a very simple and humorous way and I was using it for doing my research! But I am not ashamed the author was employed by Harvard Medical School? to teach Medical students study skills!This books teaches you how to take notes, how to use the spatial layout, ... words fail me! Trust me when I say it is a FUN book with a lot of power packed in it!"
1,"Colorful and entertaining At first,kept childs interest,however,she wanted the sphere to stay open so she could get inside it! Managed to do so ,only we had to hold it open. Is very effective as a manipulative for toddlers"
1,"One of the greatest films ever! The dead rise and attack the living for an unknown reason. George Romero ignores the voodoo trend in zombies and leaves a mystery behind as to why the dead rise. Seven people trapped inside an old farm house fight off the plague of zombies, while at the same time fighting eachother. The ending is as harrowing and dehumanizang as anything by Stanley Kubrick. Some think its a bad, low budget movie. Thats what can show on the outside. On the inside, its a movie masterpiece. END"
1,"Rock history Okay  I admit bias. I was there in southeastern Oklahoma and I knew these guys when they did this album. For me, it is a bit of the history of American rock, and I think that is deserved praise. They went from this to have a couple of Billboard top tens, including a number  with Western Union. By then, The Attic where I heard them play several times was a distant memory, Im sure. Even in abstensia, they continued to mentor me and my aspiring band. We never made it as far  but I hope their own memories of those days are as good as mine! I am very pleased to have found that this music remains available!"
1,"Life Saver These dvds are amazing. They keep my month olds attention and they can always calm him down when he is upset. He could watch these over and over. The music is calming for him. I love them for my child, and would recommend them for any parent."
1,"The divine combination of Bach and Hahn My first experience of Hilary Hahn was her debut CD which immediately secured a place in my heart.I am unable to listen to that CD without weeping! As a lucky resident of Baltimore, I was able to see her perform with the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra soon after my discovery. The Hilary Hahn space in my heart grew larger. The way Hahn plays Bach is nothing short of brilliant! Her performance of the allegro assai of BWV  on this CD is breathtaking!"
1,"Good taste, great price This was some of the best American sturgeon caviar Ive tried, in terms of taste and even texture, although the texture still falls short of the imported roe. For the price, howevereven with the big shipping cost to CAit cant be beat. I would order from this company again."
1,works good I have had this atenna set up in my atttic and works about as good as expected. We leave near a church with a steeple and I still think that iis what is giving us soom problems. Also when the weather is bad the HD channnels are more glitchy.all and all this is the rd atenna tried and has worked and got the most channels with a few problems
1,great price  great product My sweet little cat has feline kidney disease....I am cooking natural food for the little guy. Taurine is absolutely a major nutrient in a cats diet and this is measured and easy to add to his daily meals. Thanks for making this so convenient to help my little guy. BTW....Im also taking it. If its good for my little guys eye sight...its good for mine. Thanks for a great product at a very good price. Quick delivery too!
1,"Not as high qualtiy as past ones We like these but fear they might not hold up as long as our older ones we just replaced with these. They appear to be a thinner cheaper glass then the  year old ones we replaced, time will tell. For now, however, they work fine."
1,minus one star for condition This book is amazing. Ive been wanting to find a way to start introducing meditation and relaxation to my  year old. She loves this book. It got to me super quick but the cover was dirty.
1,talk about help out I am just starting yoga so everything is a challenge. I love this strap because it has so many places to put hands and feet when stretching. This is just so much better than a plain strap. You get comfy pockets to put your feet in and STRETCH those muscles. Well worth the money.
1,WOW Loved it A great read. Loved the interaction between Jeff and his brother. His future SIL is one smart lady.Was hooked after the first chapter and will be betting the rest of his books. Good series and I hope Bartlett keeps on writing them. Super book.
1,"Great Dictionary, Excellent Reference Translation I could not be able to communicate clearly in the English and Spanish Language without this dictionary, The Concise American Heritage Spanish Dictionary SpanishEnglish, this is an excellent translation dictionary for those seeking to improve their EnglishSpanish vocabulary and wish to master both languages. It is clear, precise, and up to date, for modern usage."
1,"A Study In Cool All in all, this was a delightful book and fun to read. It was hard to put down. Rebel Heart is a case study in cool and the people that make that word exist. Everyone I have loved since childhood is here in technicolor and then some. The spirit of the book is good no bitterness or cowardly outburst. Just straightshootin and in many cases I felt like I was right there in the room.Bebe Buell is many things to many people. To me she is a REAL woman who has lived and can now pass on her experiences to us young pups who might make too many mistakes otherwise. She is also inspirational in the looks department. If I can age anywhere near as well, I will be a happy camper she is just beautiful!I was kinda left hanging at the end. I am so curious now to know what has happened in her life since the book came out. It screams for a sequel."
1,"Outstanding Its not a perfect game, as some people have noted. But I do think it is amazing.I played through the single player game, that was interesting, albeit a little linear for my liking. But the game really comes alive in multi player.If there were no multi player, Id probably rate this three stars and call it over priced. But the inclusion of such a comprehensive multi player experience makes this game outstanding.There are plenty of weapons to choose from, all kinds of unlockables and promotions. You get to pit your wits against players from all over the world. Its just a great game. And I am not a huge FPS player, Im not even a very enthusiastic gamer quite honestly, but this game will provide hours of entertainment, and is certainly a must have for any PS owner."
1,Great Text and Reference This is the text I use when teaching Vehicle Rescue Operations and Technician classes. It is also the reference I turn to when I need clarification on the topic. Widely used here in Illinois.
1,"beautiful design and use me a million times kind of product i think most people must have used corelle products,they are most durable and very good stuff.....they work perfect in ovens,microwaves and fridges....my only disappointment with this stuff is that the lids dont close perfectly like i expected.....dont get me wrong close nicely,but they leave some slight gaps here and their....i was more like expecting something that seals away with zero gaps....but that ok i use them for serving for daily purposes so.....it does not matter.....i wash them in dishwasher...."
1,"Perfect setup in under  minutes The longest part of setting this MP player up was opening the packaging. I didnt even open the CD it came with, just plugged it in to the USB port, opened Windows Media Player and synced the songs! It was amazingly fast and the sound is great!For the price of under , you cant beat this thing. It even has a SD expansion slot!This is a gift for my  year old son, but I wonder if Im going to have to keep it away from my husband!Excellent buy!"
1,"Great HD! Having done some searching for a HD to add support for my iBook, I chose the EzQuest Monsoon  GB. It has received high marks Macworld, for one and is very competitively priced.The Monsoon is nicely constructed, with a very slim design vertically, a very small footprint that features twin FireWire  ports and a single USB . port. Quality cabling is included. It arrives preformatted for Mac OSX instructions cover formatting for Windows.It is simple to use and speedy I am very pleased with my purchase!"
1,"Blondie is BACK!!!!! I heard this single accidentally one day while flipping radio stations. I took me no time at all to know who it was. I have loved Blondie for ages but never thought it would be possible to regain a sound once thought lost to the decades. The music is moving and upbeat. Not overly intense mentally but not bubblegum pop either. I love it. Everytime I hear it it gets me all revved up. Reminds me of the way I felt when Call Me was released. You just had to sing along. It transported you. There is something truly wonderful about the music of this group. You can never reproduce the freshness of it. The music will be good forever as far as Im concerned. I listened to this Cd so much that its already gotten scratched, so well,Ill pay again to replace it. Long live Blondie!"
1,"TEAC CD player The sound quality of the TEAC is very good. My only complaint is that it does not have a true shuffle function. The shuffle command will only make the tracks on a single CD play in random order. It should play random tracks throughout all the CD in the changer. Other than that, I am happy with the TEAC."
1,"Excellent Response I ordered a SmartTool from AMAZON, with two day shipping. I received it in time from UPS whereupon they left it on our front entry. We found that the box was empty having discovered a hole in the end of it either created during shipment or neighborhood thief. I emailed AMAZON to explain and they IMMEDIATELY Saturday sent another. I received it on the following Monday. Thanks AMAZON for a wonderful responsewith no trips for me to UPS, etc.PJL Fort Smith, Arkansas"
1,What is going on here? This book is like being a child again and fearing the unknown. Its excellent...it gets you thinking and sort of reminds me of not to give anything away but the family that inspired the Fuguitive movie and tv show. It has an ending that I cannot say. But if you do read it you will never forget it. In addition there is a small story that is nice at the end
1,"Good quality umbrella I bought this umbrella because I walk to work everyday and was getting wet with my old umbrella. This one is great  I stay dry and it doesnt blow inside out. The only reason it didnt get  starts is that it is a little too big and heavy for me to carry every day, so I only use it on days when it is raining and still carry my old umbrella daily for unexpected weather. The umbrella is a little expensive, but I think it is pretty sturdy and so far holding up very well. I also like it because it is not huge like a golf umbrella  it is just big enough for one person, so if you are looking for a really big umbrella, this isnt the right one. But I would recommend it for anyone looking for a good quality umbrella."
1,"Better than I thought it would be THE HITCHER is actually a pretty good remake, and a pretty good thriller. I think we all know the premise a young couple meets a hitchiker who ends up being a murderer. Its more than that though.. you get to care about the characeters, and you get to know them.The two stand outs are clearly SEAN BEAN and SOPHIA BUSH. They both do a wonderful job. Sean Bean is just creepy as hell in this.. he will really scare the hell outta you. Sophia Bush shows that she can do more than One Tree Hill and teen dramas.. she is a good actress in this.Have fun with the movie. Dont expect a masterpiece, but it certainly is good. Dont write it off because you dont like remakes.Kelly"
1,"A Fine Map of Cognitive Science Cognitive Science is a slippery notion, which may be intrinsic to any endeavor oops, Thagards Canadian make that endeavour that emerges from many different fields. But Thagard makes an honorable and largely successful stab at giving it some boundaries and some internal structure. If youre intrigued by the idea of mind science and just want a general idea of what the issues, approaches and shortcomings of its current state are, then this book written for an introductory, probably undergraduate, course is a fine place to start."
1,"Nieces Birthday I bought this for my  yr old nieces birthday that lives in a different state.She loves to sing and dance and thought this would be perfect for her. I ordered it late the week of her birthday. I was pleasantly surprised that it arrived the day of her party. I was told it was her favorite present and has not put it down since. Dont know first hand about the quality, just that it works after a month.I might have to update on that."
1,"Good Chain Great chain reasonable price. This is the chain that came with my Jamis Aurora, it works great. I see no reason to buy an overpriced chain just because it has a name brand attached to it."
1,"nothing can prepare you... MORTAL KOMBAT!!! this is the last D MK game, and it is freakin awesome! this game provides intense fast paced action, wicked combos, and awesome fatalities. plus nothing says in your face like kicking your friends rear end in mortal kombat, this is a must have for anyone into the N games."
1,"Fun and Pretty Silver and Coral Earrings These earrings are just as pictured, bright red and polished silver. They are an inch or so long and sway prettily from my ears. I have enjoyed them very much. Unlike some other semiprecious materials, red coral seems to be fairly uniform in color saturation, in my experience. These matched perfectly a red coral bracelet I already owned. You wont be disappointed in these, if you want a little red in your jewelry wardrobe!"
1,"INCREDIBLE!!! If Im being completely honest, while I have been a HUGE clay fan since the beginning, I was a little skeptical about his first album because I couldnt imagine what type of pop songs he would be singing. Now that I have it, I cant listen to anything else! It never leaves my CD player! I love every song on it! Clay has an incredible voice and each of the songs is completely wonderful!"
1,"The Sisters Strike again Anne George has produced yet another priceless adventure of the two sisters from Birmingham. I love the great southern expressions, the food and the humor. You laugh out loud at the perfect turns of phrase, the great characterizations and the wonderful husbandwife relationship."
1,"Quite a good low budget movie This is one of those rare teen thriller titles that is actually quite original and well put together. The story deals with a lot of scifi elements, somewhat like those films Charles Band put out a few years back on the defunct Pulse Pounders label.I rented this thinking it was probably an average at best film, but the story draws you in and doesnt let go. The acting is above average for a lowbudget film, and the characters are well written. The CGI special effects are numerous and quite realistic, especially when you consider this did not have a budget anywhere near what the latest Lord Of The Rings or Star Wars movies had.I liked this movie enough to buy it for my collection, after previously renting it. Give it a try...you just may like it also."
1,"Waynbo We bought this Copper canyon  tent for  season camping, should have thought about the full screen top. it is not a tent for chilly nights.we like the roominess and style, is fairly easy to set up, be sure to use a tarp under the thin floor.this tent has enough large windows, it could only have  the roof screened, and would be a little warmer at night, and still have adequate venting for summer. also would like storage pockets, overall  we like the style and roominess and ease of set up, and is very light for its size."
1,"Seek and You Will Find I propped this book up on the bookrack on my new treadmill. I opened it up being careful not to break the spine. I love the way a new book feels. I love the way I feel  excited about the treasure hidden between the covers.And what a treasure it was. WANDA GUTIERREZ included an entire books worth of information in the first chapter. My thirtyminute workout passed by before I knew it.I savored every spiritual morsel in this book. The succeeding chapters held as much nourishment as the first. After reading this book, you will be a more mature Christian  one who knows the Source of Peace, and your search will be over."
1,"Excellent guide This book is an excellent guide for hiking in Colorado. First, it has excellent pictures to give the reader an idea of the scenery. Then, it provides directions on how to get to the different parks. Also, it provides maps to the hiking trails and a lot of other useful information on whether dogs are allowed, whether the hike is suitable for family outing, whether there is a fee, phone numbers one can call, etc. The quality of the paper is astonishing. It also provides small paragraphs on bear etiquette, lions etiquette, etc. It provides information on the flaura and fauna expected to be seen on each hike. Very informative, very interesting and very useful book."
1,"Surprisingly true and open. One of the most honest books... I have owned this book for a long time but hesitated to read it because of the catching title. This is not quite what it is about...It is about Ramas path in spirituality and there is a lot for every person who searches whatever their path may be. Very open, quite critical of false spirituality, totally aware of the possible mistakes on the road and of the traps set up by pride. I love the simple yet beautiful writing. It is not true that all the sages presented in the book are said to be enlightened. Quite the contrary. But there is a certain humility and great love for people that allows Swami Rama to describe their mistakes without scorn or hate. Also interesting insights on all the major religions. VERY ENLIGHTENING."
1,Better option than an ottoman for nursing moms Very attractive and much more practical than an expensive rocking ottoman. I pair it with my glider. It was easy to assemble and looks very handsome. My only grip is that the rubberlike padding on the feet of the stool came loose pretty shortly into its use. These pads are necessary to prevent sliding. I intend on contacting the manufacturer for replacements.
1,"Funny, original film I remember when this came out. Bill was on GMA  did the weather.Funny, original film. You wish comedies were ALL like this.Bill did a great job as Phil. All the things he did in the film as February  kept repeating.Harold in his bit part as the doctor. Another cameo by Willie Garson Stanford from Sex  the City, Theres Something About Mary.Decent extras on the DVD.BUT, an anniversary edition? Needed more. Like.........NO CHAPTER LIST OR ANY INFORMATION INSIDE ON THE FILM. The film was a hit  this is an anniversary release of it, how about something inside to read on the film?I did NOT care for the artwork on the front."
1,"nice Controller works like a charm. Cheap and reliable. Since its not a proprietary PS controller the analog sticks arent extremely sensitive for FPSs COD in particular. Other then that, good controller."
1,"An Excellent Character Study Dont watch this movie if you are feeling depressed as it is not a comedy. It is a beautifully directed and photographed situation drama. Read the other reviews for the plot line. If you like really great character development and a bit of complexity, then this movie is for you. If you like special effects extravaganzas it will put you to sleep. The acting is about as good as it gets. Just remember when you see the kitten scene that the kitten has been diagnosed with a fatal disease."
1,"Variations on Bukowski. A modern master at play. He gets  stars here because I dont have the heart to give him . Look, if you dig Bukowski then buy this book. Youll read it at least once. It lacks the gravity of his previous works. Lighthearted, reassuringly familiar fluff from an author who paid his dues."
1,"Thank you Luther Thank you Luther for you sharing your talent with the world. We will miss you. I look forward to hearing you sing in paradise soon. For your mom and nieces and nephews we are so sorry for your loss. For your fans and colleagues, well always love you. Rest in peace."
1,"Good hot coffee When my coffeemaker stopped working I searched around for a new one  bought a Krups at the store and kept it one day  didnt like the coffee, it felt flimsy and it only made  cups  I searched on line and Cuisinart won out over all others. I am very happy with coffeemaker  it looks great and makes a good, HOT cup of coffee it has adjustment for tempature My only complaint is that if you dont click the top in all the way when you close it, it will overflow. It also is a little hard to snap the top in place until you get used to its placement. Top of carafe is hard to remove and a bit sharp. These are very minor complaints. It makes a good cup of coffee  I found that you should use less coffee grounds than other coffeemakers. I am very happy with it and hope it lasts longer than my Braun."
1,"FOR MORE THAN JUST FABRICS As a mixedmedia artist, there is a great appeal in learning ways to design my own materials that I use in small books, paintings, wall hangings and multimedia collages. Although this book seems aimed at those artists who prefer working with textiles, I have found solid advice on many aspects of relief printing, with stamps made from easy to locate materials, such as erasers, vegetables and self adhesive weatherstrip material. Other methods such as discharge, resist, and silkscreen printing are shown as ways to incorporate your stamped images. There is a wide range of applications of handcreated designs, from clothing, to home decor items, to correspondence to textile and mixedmedia art. C  T Publishing gears its books toward quilt and fabric artists, but I believe this book is a valuable resource for any artist desiring to develop their skills in hand printing."
1,Walk the Line with Johnny I have always liked Johnny Cash as a casual listener having few songs in my library and no CDs in my collection. After seeing Walk the Line recently I needed to hear what he was really saying in his music. This CD has opened up my perception of both the man and his music. It is fun and from what I can tell has a great mix of his songs that I have been enjoying since cracking open the seal! You dont have to be a country fan or in fact any kind of fan other than a music fan to enjoy this one!
1,"Good MP Player irock  is a very good MP player.It has MB memory, plays mpwma and also has a FM tuner.Ive used RIO Mp player and I would rate this much better than that. I got this from buy.com for a very cheap price.The pros.Small and lightweight..Good user interface..Software for downloading the files onto the player is simple and effective..FM tuner has  presets..Plays MPWMA formats..Sleek leather case.The cons.The earplugs which come along with the player is useless..The forwardprevious buttons are difficult to use..Equaliser settings are predefined and cannot be changed..Does not display the running time of a song.I would definitely recommend this product."
1,"Authentic powerful blend of traditional songs and creativity Picked this CD up at Wupatki National Monument out west. The songs are based on traditional Hopi songs but with embellishments such as flute and occasional background nature sounds. A great mix of drumming, chanting, rattlework. Definately easier for most westerners to listen to than powwow songs. A bit more tribal than the latest Carlos Nakai but generally in that genree. Sounds somewhere between Nakai and Douglas Blue Feather. Really suprisingly great stuff."
1,"Custer Swiveling Lite is a bargain I purchased this lite for my bandsaw. I was very impressed with the quality the magnetic base is very powerful, the cord is heavy gauge, the swivel is well constructed. When I ordered it I didnt realize it came with the optional trouble lite metal cover. I priced commercial lites for more than twice the cost prior to buying this one."
1,"A fine and helpful introduction to Marks structure and narrative! Veteran Dutch scholar Bas van Iersel has provided a fine introduction for readers of Marks Gospel. His analysis of Marks overall structure is oftquoted, and I find it persuasive, even though, like many others, I am not always convinced by his attempts to find similar concentric structure within various sections.Van Iersel has obviously given years of attention to Mark, and this work is full of helpful observations on and about it, that beginners and scholars alike will find helpful. He expanded the work in his laterMark Academic Paperback, which is much longer and more technical. I have yet to read the whole.Again, this is a fine, accessible, and enormously helpful introduction to Mark as narrative, from a real Dutch master. Highly recommended!"
1,"One of the Mathematics master works of the th century I have this checked out of the county library, but two weeks or two years,I would still have trouble reading it all.Dr. John Conway is one of the most important mathematicians of the th century and Dr. Sloane isnt very far behind that. With their friend John Leech,they have published this landmark in the history of group theory that seems destined to be beside Coexters work as the most influential work onon the theory of higher Euclidean and hyperbolic n dimensional groups.That these groups have been related to the practical area of error free coding in information theory has made this knowledge both interesting and useful as well. With some awe I realize how much thought and workwent into writing this book.I you were Dr. Sloane or Dr. Conway, you would have to ask yourselves, how can you ever top this?This book is not easy reading, it hasnt been dumbed downand the results are real enough for anybody."
1,Good Solid Oak Frame Made in the USA Ive been sleeping on this simple all wood frame for a year. It doesnt creak or shift much at all compared to the standard steel bed frames made in China. The queen frame could use a center support which is not included but sag is minimal. You might want to get a headboard to go along with this frame. My pillows often sneak off the mattress down the extra  of space created by the end frame and legs. Go for the danish oil finish. Good night.
1,"Good solution I have returned to electronic organizing after just using paper basedfor a few years. The calendar software is not as good as Lotus notes which I had through my old job, but its better than what comes with the old Palm Pilot. The new z handheld is lighter and smaller and, best of all, rechargeable. Now I even keep shopping lists in it. Will try to use the contacts for all my address needs since there is a way to download and create labels. YAY"
1,"Add some quality to your meals... This is in an essential seasoning to stock up on if youre moving someplace with little western cuisine. For quality seasoning, Lawrys is a legacy. Yay! No mysterious anticaking agent. If you keep these packets too long the seasoning does clump but youre not going to be eating stroganoff seasoning raw now, are you? Just mix it well. Happy stroganoff!"
1,"Super Size Me Fantastic DVD. More people should see this and stop the fast food habit.I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in protecting their health. Fast food is one of the worst things we can put in our bodies, unless we have a death wish, then go ahead and eat it! See the DVD, you will be glad you did."
1,"Memorize, memorize, memorize I bought this book and took the test in .After three weeks in which I read the book front to back and memorized all  qustions I took the test and past with an  score. This was my second attempt at a CLEP, and as before felt very comfortable during the exam. Keep in mind that any questions you do not recognize, skip. If you guess it may cost you.Good luck."
1,"Good Book, Too Much About Bloodlines A very interesting book, from astor, to bohemian grove, to count st germain, to demoinc possesion, to easter island, to freemasonry, to george washington, to histler, to islam, to jacq de molay, to kalisti, to lumeria, to macdonalds, to nordic blonds, to ouroborus, to pike... albert, to Quetzalcoatl, to reptilians, to satanism, to truman, to eurasia, to the vatican, to weishaupt adam, to the xfiles, to yellow torch, and to Zecharia Sitchin.all in all a good, fing book, but...He went to deeply into the bloodlines which detracted and made the story a bit of a strugle at times that lost a star my friends.all in all Hail ErisAll Hail Discordia..."

1,"Good Movie when you dont want to think I saw this Movie when it was in theater and loved it. I was in bad mood going in and when i walked out i was much better. Josh Duhamel plays a reporter and Kristen Bell plays Beth who is a Curator in New York. Beth has to go to Rome, Italy for her sisters wedding and she is feeling down. Beth is unlucky in the love area and after the wedding she goes to the Fontana de Amore and picks up coins from it. Now there is a saying that who ever picks up a coin from the fountain will fall in love with the one who threw it in. So Beth picks up five of them. Josh Duhamel is one of the guys from the wedding and is attacted to beth. Now after Beth gets back from Rome strange thinks start happening and that is when things star to get intresting for beth...."

1,Good movie One of the better Sesame Street DVDs we have. The story line is Big Bird trying to find some la laers for a musical celebration. There are little shorts of previous sesame street skits. It all ends with a grand finale of music and dancing. Good movie. My son loves it.  months
1,One of the Best Albums I have Amos Lee is an amazing artist with an amazing talent for music I had heard him once when I bought the album and when I got it it was amazing he is one of the premiere singersongwriters of our time and when he becomes more wellknown he will go down as one of the greatest singersongwriters ever. I would reccomend this album to anyone who is a true fan of music even if this is not your style of music you will grow to love it I promise.
1,OUTSTANDING WORK  OUTSTANDING AUTHORS The premise of the Noir series is to sample writers from each of the cities as they present stories that deal with areas with the city. This San Francisco edition is no exception. Sure some are much better than others but this is a wonderful way to sample authors you may not have tried. RECOMMENDED
1,"Julie Andrews second best Christmas album. Julie Andrews represents my favorite traditional Christmas voice. The orchestral arrangements here are a perfect compliment to her vocals. For me this album, combined with Christmas with Julie Andrews her very BEST Christmas album provides the most beautiful carols of the Christmas season. This particular album also includes  memorable songs from movie musicals, as an added surprise...very enjoyable,however, out of sync with the holiday genre , which, is the only reasonthat I didnt give this CD a  star rating."
1,"Lots of useful information! John Emsley has written a series of interesting books on how chemistry interacts with our everyday lives such asNatures Building Blocks An AZ Guide to the Elements,Molecules of Murder Criminal Molecules and Classic Cases. The Consumers Good Chemical Guide is well written and provides straight talk on how consumer chemistry. Not interested? Consider How do pain killers work? Why are some better than others? What is the history of artificial sweeteners? Is Aspartame actually dangerous? What causes perfumes to smell? How can chemistry help you devise a foolproof diet? What is the difference between the different types of fats? How are they different once they enter your body?A small sampling of the topics, but it really does not do the book justice. Remember each topic is being describing by a topnotch researcher, and real references are provided. My final verdict  highly recommended for anyone who has an interest in chemistry. Stars"
1,"What makes this series more relevant to Batman fans... I have always been a Batman fan, for as long as I can remember. Batman The Animated Series was a godsend! Then later came Batman Beyond and I was intrigued. What makes this series more relevant, as anyone who also watches the new series Justice League Unlimited will know, is that Bruce Wayne is the unwitting father of Terry Mcginnis! Courtesy of genetic manipulation technology and a government agent who felt that the world would always need Batman. This series neatly fills gaps in the stories of many major characters, and ties much of the animated Batman threads together. Definitely a must have for any fan."
1,"Good music, but dont excpect the Suicide Machines If you like poppunk, such as bands like Blink and Saves the Day, then you will enjoy this CD. However, if you are a previous fan of the Suicide Machines, and have heard their previous material, then you may be dissapointed. This is not the old Suicide Machines sound, at all, and apparently that angers many fans. While this may not be typical Suicide Machines, that doesnt make this bad music. Its good pop punk, its just not what youd expect from these guys. If this were any other band, with all the same songs, then the ratings would be higher, garaunteed.Good poppunk."
1,"I Love this Camera! Ive had this camera for  years now. I love it. I bought  months before a long overseas trip where i took over , photos. It takes amazing photos and videos. It has several settings that make it easy to take perfect photos. I love the panaramic photo option. Its a little difficult to line it up perfect but they turn out amazing. It will take tons of video if you have a memory card. Hardest thing i had was keeping the lens cleaned. Yes it eats battiers as do all of these high functioning cameras. Best thing is it will use any rechargable AA batteries. After  years my daughter dropped it on concrete and the battery door broke and wont close. I got the Z and it pales in comparison to this beauty."
1,Best doubles strategy book ever I have read many doubles stratgey books and this is the best ever. The court positioning works for every level. This is not a book about stroke production but how to effectively cover the court and work with your partner. If you are a beginner this is best used in conjunction with a pro and taking doubles lessons. I have taken lessons from top level instructors and the positioning used in this book is solid.
1,"A fairly good book This is one of the many books I used and this is one of the two books that helped me most. The other book was the Official GMAT guide. I did not use Kaplan. The tests on the CD are a fair represenatation of what one can expect in the real GMAT. The maths sections are bit easy as compared to what one can get in the GMAT but verbal sections are pretty close to the real GMAT. On the three simulated tests I scored , and . My score in the real GMAT was . My scores in verbal and quant. sections in the simulated tests were very close to my real GMAT scores, between  to . On the flip side, the book is very verbose. I didnt pay much attention to the tricks and strategies discussed in the book but the section on reading comprehension is definitely worth a look."
1,Great light! The light is very bright and rugged. I accidentally backed it in to a dirt back and no damage just messed up the alignment. Ive been using this light as a back up light for about  months and I havent had a problem. I highly recommend this light for its durability and price.
1,"Great Soundtrack let me start by saying this great soundtrack, full of bone chilling music by J. Peter Robinson. My favorite track is Transformation. My only complant is that the music from the first part of the end credites are missing, oh well all the other tracks make up for the lost. this has every bit of music from on itexcept for begining of end credites."
1,"Mob is bout to BLOW UP!!! You need to get this cd, this just isnt another down south rap album. Field Mob is bringin some fresh beats wit some great origional lyrics. If you aint heard bout these boys you betta open yo ears cuz they bout to blow up. Fk it, just get the album you wont be dissapointed."
1,"Worth finding  funny stuff This threetoon set was issued in  and was off the shelves almost before it landed there. As a Roger Rabbit fan, I missed the shortlived offer  they were gone when I checked the stores, so I bought mine used on an auction site. You are in the right place to buy your copy  you can get them now via Amazons seller program. Yay!My understanding is that Disney was getting flack in  for these toons  for being nonDisney and too adult. Dont worry  who could not love Roger Rabbit and his lovely wife Jessica? Adults will laugh  but they are funny for everyone and nothing to blush over  much!These are really great toons and worth looking for."
1,"The most touching autobiography ever This book is truly wonderful. And while no one should take it as a bible, it does indeed have things we all had to experience. In a way or another, all of my friends who have read this book had something in common with him. And Im not an exception. It is a must, wholeheartedly. I could read it many times and still so dont get bored of it. I love it. I really mourn he has passed away. But his legacy is eternal. Read the Foundation  Robot series, and youll know what a so great mind can create."
1,"My favorite DVD This is my favorite movie of all time. I have reviewed this movie for Yahoo.com but, I like it enough to review it again here. Freeman and Robbins made a great on screen dual male lead. This movie is filled with realism and suspense. I must say the first time I watched it I was stunned at the twist ending. I should also say this was a movie adapted from the book Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, written by Stephen King. King is an incredible story teller. I like this movie better than another adaption. I have enjoy Kings work for many years but, this is really a deep story line.I cant think of a scene that I like any better that the twist scene so I will not detail it as to hold the suprise for those who havent seen it. Its a great movie just buy it and enjoy."
1,"Two Words AWE SOME! This is the niftiest kitchen gadget to come down the pike since . . . EVER! I love me some Egg McMuffin in the morning. But there are two problems  I live out in the sticks, and the nearest McDonalds is nearly a half hour away, and  it gets expensive after a while. Enter the Back to Basics TEM Slot EggandMuffin Toaster. For the cost of one breakfast at McDonalds for my wife and me, we can get the ingredients to make our favorite breakfast sandwiches for a couple of weeks! They taste even better, we get them quicker, we get them faster, and we save time and money making the drive into town.I am SUPER pleased with this product, and looking forward to using it for years to come. HIGHEST rating and recommendation!"
1,"Great Scale! The scale came on time, and was easily set up. I find it to be accurate and to give reproducible results something I have never found in a consumer level digital scale. I highly recommend this scale for anyone serious about following their weight!"
1,I still think back to this book I read this book several years ago but a lot of points still ring in my head now  I do think this book helped me realize things about myself so that I would be ready to be in the wonderful relationship Im in now. I recommend it to friends often when theyve been repeatedly ending up in the same bad relationships or repeating mistakes and dont know why.
1,"Icky AND fantastic Only began  wks ago. No can do in liquid, sorry. Just too hard to drink down. Gelcaps to my rescue, I filled s, filled a sm jar, now I take  wBreakfast  dinner. Notice movements are ez  bulked up. I also now eliminate  x daily now. Great! No discomfort, Im with it for several mos trial. Dr. suggested fiber, I googled  this came up as the best. I will revise this review as I continue."
1,"Maybe the best series of all time The four Hyperion books Hyperion, Fall of Hyperion, Endymion, and Rise of Endymion comprises the best scifi series I have ever read, and maybe the best of any fictional genre. Amazing story, characters and the Shrike is the coolest figure in Scifi hands down. Read these books now...as well as everthing else Dan Simmons has written."
1,"Great Stretches! I really like this stretch DVD. The instructor is very pleasant with no fancy music or props. Just what I like. These stretches are basic but work amazingly well. I think she holds the stretches just the right amount of time and the pace is perfect  not too fast or slow. Good for beginners, athletes, and anyone looking for a good overall stretch that isnt too difficult. The DVD is broken up in five  minute stretch routines. You can play all of them for a really great  minute stretch workout, or pick only a few for a shorter workout. Number  workout, is the most challenging stretch that brings a little bit of yoga into the routine. I do this DVD twice a week in the morning before I start my day, but could be done in the evening right before bed. Its nice and relaxing. I recommend this to people who want a not too difficult, overall body, stretch routine. I just wish there were more stretch routines on this DVD because its that good!"
1,The Oldest Kind of Magic I loved the chemistry between Daria and Bent and the way the two tackled the problems together. It was a fun read and I never put it down. I can see why its won so many recent contests and Im looking forward to the sequel!
1,"A useful message for women Men are divine slobs If you have ever watched a beer commercial, you have probably had two thoughts.l This is really stupid. A lot of research goes into this stuff, and it actually gets men to buy beer, so these marketers must be on to something.This is what they know There are millions  no, tens of millions  of men out there who operate on the intellectual and emotional level of singlecelled organisms.E. Jean Carroll never forgets that.But unlike those women  our exgirlfriends and exwives  who resented our simplicity, she forgives us our trespasses.Indeed, she celebrates our idiocy.Saint that she seems to be, her message to women is that they should get out there and find the best slob in the bunch.This blend of radiant optimism and whatareyougonnado realism makes for strategies that, like her prose, zip all over the map.But I bet her method works."
1,"A Great Help I bought this book right after reading The Complete Idiots Guide to Understanding Catholicism, and it was my best buy so far.I was born and raised Catholic, but since I moved to a mostly nonCatholic town, I have been constantly asked why this and that. I found most of my answers in this book. It explains what Catholics thoughout the world believe in common and its easy to read and understand. It explains from passages on the Bible to Catholic tradition.This is a must have for every Catholic home, and a constant source of knowledge and answers."
1,A truly beautiful  and clever  book! The play by Louise Saunders is verbally clever and quite funny what makes the book truly remarkable are the exquisite illustrations by Maxfield Parrish. Highly recommended!
1,"A Must Read Since , security has become political. This book cuts through the rhetoric and explains how security work and how to be safer. I feel like my eyes have been opened, and I see the security around me in a new light. Im giving this book to all of my friends for a Christmas present!"
1,"Misunderstood Point Blank gets flamed by most of the Springsteen fans. The book doesnt deserve this. It is true, Sandford uses a lot of anonymous persons and it would be better if we knew who they are. Sandford doesnt paint a bad picture of Springsteen. The summary of the book could be Springsteen aint a saint, but hes a good and honest man who has come a long way to become what he is today. A must read for fans"
1,"Excellent Primer! This should be on every techies bookshelf! Much better than the info in those  get rich quick mailings, for a lot less. If you are interested in learning technical basics, at a bargain price, this is the place to start. You will find yourself reviewing it over and over."
1,A great take on Star Trek for the new generation I honestly havent seen any of the original star trek movies with Kirk and Spok. I have seen quite a few of the next generation movies with Picard. This movie is amazing and now I want to go back and watch all the older movies I havent seen.
1,"Lara Fabian sings in Spanish I on the other hand, prefer her newest tracks written  sung in Spanish. Like the song Quedate. The first time I heard it on the brazilian soap opera, El Clon. . . I said to myself I have to find out who sings that song! I agree she sings  times better than Celine. My question is when is she coming out with a CD in Spanish?"
1,"Good starter video for complete beginners I bought this video for my mother and I believe it will be a good tool for her to begin learning Tai Chi. It is not fancy but the price is reasonable and the instruction is coherent. Claire Hooten gives background information on Tai Chi and speaks of the  principles posture, relaxation, etc at the start. After you watch it once youll want to fast forward to the  minute mark for practicing the movements. She demonstrates the entire short form first  postures once through then breaks them down in groups of  or  and gives the instruction twice. The first is just her from the front and the second adds two students who perform with their backs to you for the EZ learning reverse view. Claires verbal instructions are excellent  they provide good body cues and a visual imagery. The video ends with a complete run through of the short form in the reverse view."
1,"Great Film This is a great film and give good grain and great contrast, however, tread carefully if you plan on using this with your Holga. Holgas light leaks and relative slowness of the shutter  usually add a great surprise when the film comes back from developing may get you t really washed outblurry pictures like I did  not a big deal, its just for fun  but be warned.I did use about half of this roll at sunset and night and the  or so I got then came out great."
1,"Weights recommended I bought the DVD without knowing that weights are recommended for the weight exercises. I think its importat to know that small dumbells are used for the upper body workout. Anyway, overall the DVD is good because you can customize your workout."
1,"Excellent! I sell stuff on eBay and Amazon.com all the time, and so these little bubblewrap envelopes work wonders when mailing out smaller items. From playing cards to writing utensils, these can hold all sorts of things.The only complaint I have is that the bubblewrap doesnt seem too thick, so sometimes Im afraid that, when I send more fragile things, USPS will get it broken. But then I just wrap it carefully in a little more bubblewrap or other kind of protection, and its fine.I use this one and the size  often."
1,"Quality inkjet reasonable price I own Lexmark Z almost  year. If you use for printing text. This one is the good printer at low price. However, there are some problem when print color picture and a little bit high price inkcompare with printer price."
1,"Unexpected Dont let the aesthetics of this book fool you the content is evolved and leaves you wanting more. With pieces of the story gradually revealed to you, this story keeps you guessing until the end. A love story and a mystery of sorts. Vivid and real."
1,"loved it could not put it down! I started this book near Christmas and wizzed thew the whole sriis inculding Pandora and finished recently. But this one is the first and one of the best! I seen the movie first but as alot of people will agaree the book was much better. Louis niative is endreing and his story is spell binding! Lestat is unkind and crass but thats what gets you interested I love the carecter of Claudia, her silence in the first part of her vampiric life sets you up for an emtioal blow out that you feel coming even if you didnt see the movie first. I found Armand facinating the young angel with aburn curls. There is just no way anyone will beable to stop with this one."
1,a classic album This is an album that should straddle the market  jazz lovers for the sympathetic playing of Oscar P and the band but also for any Fred Astaire fans. No he doesnt have the best quality voice  but  he has an astonishing feel and his timing  phrasing is beyond critisism.
1,"almost great. when i ordered this, i choose  day shipping. I planed on using it a week and a half later for a paintpall game i was going too and i was going to need something to feed my hoppers. It took almost  weeks from the day it shipped... to get to my house.. of course i didnt get to use it in the game but i still got it and thats a suprize seeing how customer service was extremely rude. after looking over the product I have to say that this is well built, however i didnt like the cross draw, and opted to buy a drop down leg holster like i used in iraq. Over all this is a good product. and its not reallly all that expensive."
1,"Worth the wait This album has been on back order, discontinued, reissued, discontinued, reissued... well, you get the picture, for almost three years. I was finally able to get my hands on one of the three remaining copies that Amazon sourced and it was well worth the wait. Some great songs by a great singer with some amazing backing bands E Street Band, Southside Johnny, etc."
1,"Good sander for the price. The sander has worked well for me for over two years. The bag cuts down on dust considerably, but not completely. It is comfortable to hold and work with for long periods. I used it to prep walls for painting and it performed well. The only thing I dont like is the rather difficult paper loading. Still, for the price..."
1,"superb, better than a fictional novel very thought provoking book. Mr. Sardar takes you on a long religious, political and spiritual journey which starts in the s and continues to current times. This world and Islam could be in a much better shape if we had more thinkers like him. loved the book."
1,"rebellion on mars This game overal is a good game with no flaws realy exept u might get stuck when the way is right under ur nose. The story line was pretty good, could of been beter but its ur basic rebelion exept its on mars. U can save anywhere u please which is good. But it felt as if something was missing, it just wasnt fun enough to give it a five. I played this game once and probaly will never play it again. If u played and love first person shooters u should get this game, if ur new to the gaming world this is still a good game to get,maybe its just that i just got done playing metalgearsolid  and  so it brings this game down.give it a try even though."
1,"Over  photographs of an extremely handsome young man Steven Underhill photographs one of his most popular models, Jeff Conger, in a braod range of settings. The settings are primarily set in the countryside, in the barn and the fields. However there are other interior photographs with diffused light that are very attractive. The model is so handsome that the quaity of the photograph may be overlooked. That would be a shame since Underhill is a superb photographer. There are over  photographs. Conger is half dressed in all of them but there are no fully nude photographs. The format for the book is small, about  inches by  inches. All the photographs are black and white. You might think that over  photographs of the same model would be restricting or boring, but this is not the case since Conger is not only extremely handsome and beautifully built, but his personality and relaxation with the photographer are evident in all the photographs."
1,"Same thing happening in Chile right now This movie shows the continued abuse of third world nations by the west. The water companies invloved promise cleaner drinking water for all. Unfortunately these companies also have shareholders who want bucks in return for the supply.Profits in the west is all cool for me, but when were talking about nations where the average annual wage can be  thousand dollars peryear, and thats the workers, many dont have jobs in the first place, the price of the water is often out of most peoples reach.Water rights is the big thing these days. I live in Chile and its illegal to dig a hole and use any water you find, it all belongs to someone. I understand living in a house,flat in the big city and paying for water but in the middle of the country digging a hole and using the water? Most people who live in the country earn low salaries.I mean its far from crime of the century.Whats next air?Interesting documentry."
1,"Absolutely Wonderful We used this on a ford fusion to go on vacation. You can really put a ton in it. In this bag  we fit  beach umbrella,  beachsport chairs,  suit case of toys,  HUGE rolling duffel, a beach bag , and a philteds double stroller.I really cant begin to tell you how much stuff you can put in it but it is a ton! We have a ford fusion and  small kids and to go on vacation you can not get everything in it.See posted pictures. We used this with the blow up roof rack. Malone HandiRack Inflatable Universal Roof Top Rack and Luggage CarrierThe straps do thud and are annoying. It is helpful to have zip ties in your car or safety pins to try and secure the straps to prevent noise but that is a minor issue when you compare the function."
1,"Good deal Purchased it from NevadaParts and received it in a timely manner. However, upon opening it, it is obvious this is not a Sony branded part, but a generic replacement. While the old lamp slides in and out of the tv easily, this one does not. It requires some effort to make sure it aligns along the rails and seats completely inside the old socket. Once that was accomplished after  mins, the tv turned on and worked fine. I do not have any red blinking light issues and have used the lamp for about  months. For the price, it was a good value."
1,"A super HOT read! This is erotica at its best  with hot nubile characters, a nice plot to keep the action going, and the best part of the book  great, provocative, totally HOT gay sex. i applaud jay russell for using asian and black characters and infusing them with the sexiest traits ever seen in contemporary gay erotica. thanks jay, and pls give us some more!"
1,"Unabridged Dictionary This replaced a  version, and it was nice to have the new words section, although I wished those words had been incorporated into the main dictionary. Short of ordering the entire OED I guess this will suffice. I have tried some of the electronic dictionaries and they just do not compete with the real thing."
1,"Far better than the stock antenna This is a vast improvement over stock and essential for home listening. We only listen to Sirius at home. Our reception is very strong.Make sure you have enough cable, though...the thirty feet that comes with it was not enough for our application and we needed the  foot extension also available. They work well together."
1,"Thoroughly captivating and fast paced thriller. Ive just lost an entire weekend because I couldnt put this book down. It met my criteria spys, dangerous foreign setting, fast paced, unpredictable ending, and the more I read, the faster I had to continue. Nelson DeMille has become a must read for me. I was thrilled to find this book after having read Plum Island, Gens Daughter, and Gold Coast. It is my new favorite."
1,"Good for someone new to foreign languages I used this text in an independent study course, and found that while it taught me basic grammar principles, it was confusing as it didnt use the traditional names for these principles. For example, subjunctive forms were called nonfactual. It explained what a noun, verb, sentence, and independent clause were. This is most helpful for someone who has never learned a foreign language before, but for someone who has a solid grounding in grammar, this book is a bit too simple."
1,"sturdy, bright, versatile We bought this for our preschooler. We put a shallow, flat, clear tub on top then put sensory activities in the tub. water gems, paint,shaving cream, dry erase markers, water and soap for bubbles with a straw... It is sturdy, bright and a great distraction for cold, dark winter days! Not too many activities keep her still and attentive for more than five minutes, but this does!"
1,"Best general history of Indonesia in English Readable and fairly comprehensive, this is a great resource for students and those who want to know the history of one of the worlds largest, most fascinating, and least understood by Westerners countries."
1,Love this GPS! So easy to use and set up. Love the mount which affixes to the windshield. Havent benefitted from traffic feature yet. Plenty of POIs. Glad i got the widescreen as you have to be quite precise when typing in letters and s. Volume is great i can hear unit perfectly and i have the radio turned up quite loud. Would highly recommend this to anyone especially with lifetime free traffic.
1,"the good  the bad destruction lost too much of their thrash sound after the release of the mad butcher e.p. This cd offers the spectrum of sound offered by destruction ,thrash,black,and some of the progressive metal from different stages of their career."
1,"Funny! My husband and I cracked up laughing throughout the movie. This was surprisingly very hilarious, cute, and a little disturbing at the same time weird seeing a teddy bear do sexual innuendos in a grocery store."
1,"Works great for pound monitor when jerryrigged I was hesitant to purchase this product after reading the reviews and weight my monitor. I use a ViewSonic inch that weights  pounds and is about   inches deep.All the hinges worked great and supported the weight of my monitorexcept for the tilt mechanism. However, with the use of one of the bolts that came with the arm, I was able to very easily jam it into the appropriate angle tilted very slightly upward.Setup took about  minutes, but Im definitely pleased with the purchase."
1,coolio droolio This is such a great show i am compelled to watch every episode in one night i have just purcahsed the third season and greatly exited. Season one was great the box set was okay with lack of extras it was pretty bare after you watched the shocking ending.
1,"The Arthritis Exercise Book I purchased the book The Arthritis Exercise Book at Amazon,It is a used book,it looks almost new. It is just what I wanted on the subject of exercises for arthritis. I also like that it is not so big that you can quickly find what you want."
1,"A great favorite! I was very pleased to see this wonderful novel reissued in a slightly revised version. It remains my favorite Putney book, and Ive read it more than once. A fascinating and charismatic hero, a smart and strong heroine, a sensitive and intelligent story which is nonetheless full of wit, and a lovely th century English countryside setting. What more could a reader want?"
1,Fantastic This group is fantastic. A great CD to add to your collection of Latin music. One of my most listened to albums.Este groupo es fantstico! Un buen CD para aumentar su colecin de msica latina. Uno de mis favoritos en mi iPod.
1,"Turbo Tail Tigger My wife asked for one of these awhile back, but we were not able to find one then. She requested one again this past Christmas. I was pleased to find several at Amazon.com and for a remarkably good price, so I purchased twoone for my bride and one for my eldest daughter who collects tigers of all sorts. Both my wife and my daughter were delighted with the toys, which made this Christmas fun for both of them and for me too."
1,hitachi universal charger for volt nicad batteries Received battery charger in a timely manner. Works great. Was a replacement for the original charger which had failed leaving me with several hitachi tools with dead batteries.
1,"So meet me at the cemetary gates... Ive loved the Smiths for a long time now...I remember I borrowed some tape or another at the library and copied some of my favourite songs. I dont remember which one it was cos it doesnt seem to jive with whats readily available. Enough of my babbling. So recently due to the influence of an evil friend, I started purchasing the Smiths. This one has my absolute favourite There Is a Light That Never Goes Out Im a touch morbid, but youve got to be. Plus it has fun songs as well. We all must remember that Some Girls are Bigger Than Others.... Enjoy...whether youre new or revisiting the good old days...or is that daze???"
1,"I so Totally Loooove this doll The Funk Out! Jade is totally awesome! I love her cool clothes, especially the pink shirt and white capris. Her hairstyle is the bomb! Those two pieces of hair in her bangs are very funky.But, like all girls, she cant go without the cool, funkadelic shades. They are sweet! My favorites are Jade, Yasmine, Dana, and Fianna. But if I had to choose one I would definitly choose Jade!"
1,"Amazing insight Hmmm! And I thought we were a mismatch. But after reading this book, its not about being mismatched, its about understanding the individualized person and what makes them tick. Im going to encourage my husband to read this book. Total eye opener for me. Now I see what his love language is and can now begin using the suggestions Gary Chapman makes to encourage my husband and to hopefully get the relationship between the two of us moving forward in a positive manner."
1,"WOW! Who knew? High finance is exciting! I got this book accident, and I thought give it a try.I found the novel to be riveting. The characters developed before my eyes. The plot and story line grabbed me and would not let go. For me it was a page turner well into the night. Showley"
1,"Confessions Tour Brilliant! This concert is amazing, a shame she never came to Australia with it. The best concert I have ever watched on a TV. Fantastic, amazing and brilliant. A must for any Madonna fan."
1,"They work  and thats why I bought them. I must say that I bought these because they were the least expensive, but I think thats a darn good reason, as long as the purchase will do the job. These DVDs will do the job. I had no problems at all in any of the  disks.The packaging is standard, and it works well. I use the empty ones for cookie jars"
1,"Great saucier What can I say? It is a deep pan with a cover that can go from the stovetop and into the oven. It is nonstick. It is what I wanted. I have used it several times and it worked well and was easy to clean. It is a good size. I could continue to wax eloquently about it, but this is all there is to it. It is a good price and a quality item."
1,"Read it if you know whats good for you... Although I do not care so much for the prose portions of this classic, I take them as a necessary component in the overall concept Williams cultivates in generating this book  that of treating a mancity dichotomy in the collaborative, converse terms of progression lyrical and concrete development prosaic, respectively and together. So, the anecdotal prose snippets put aside with respect to their aim, what we are left with is some sharp and aweinspired work from a man capable of genius. This work powerful and ambitious, not unlike his burning collection of poems, The Wedge, which came, not surprisingly, right on the heels of WWII."
1,"Amazing rotiserrie!! This was given to me as a birthday gift from my mom last week and I honestly dont know how I ever lived without one of these! The day I got it, I cooked a  pound chicken. It took   hours and no lie, it was the BEST chicken Id ever eaten. It was perfect. The outside was crispy and delicious and the meat couldnt have been more tender. Just tonight I tried my hand at baked potatoes after reading in the instruction manual that you can make them in the unit.  potatoes at  , its as though they were cooked on the barbecue wrapped in tin foil. Absolutely amazing. The unit itself is relatively easy to clean. I found that the spit required some soaking before the food remnants loosened from it but thats no big deal. For someone who has been on a diet for the past  months, this is an amazing product. I also have the Lean Mean Grilling Machine which I use frequently. Combined with the rotisserie, this really is a  punch knockout!"
1,"Adrenal, revivalist garage punk The second helping from this Atlanta quartet follows a similar path charted by their debut guitarheavy garage punk, ala the revivalist sounds of The Salvation Army, Chesterfield Kings and early Pandoras. Vocalist Cole Alexander spits out lyrics like an early Mick Jagger, with a dash of the bluesy swagger Jim Sohns brought to the Shadows of Knight. Plenty of fuzz guitar, lofi drums and microphone distortion round out a compellingly adrenal sound. Enhanced CD includes a Quicktime video of Fad."
1,"years strong! i bought this unit  years ago, replaced the toner once, and it has been very reliable.i was a social science major in college, so i had to print a lot for all the papers i had to write. and this printer fit the bill perfectly. i highly recommend it!"
1,"enlightening! this book is an insightful and exciting introduction to hardwaredesign, especially to those like me with a software background.the author illuminates the difference between hardware andsoftware specification, and demonstrates how his implicitRTL approach works well for synthesis of pipelined CPU designs.the only deficit is that some of the free tools listed in theappendix are no longer available."
1,"fun series, but wheres the missing episode? I thoroughly enjoyed the Monsters Resurrected discs and the episodes on them. They were informative, entertaining  have much rewatch value. The only reason that this dvd set is getting  stars and not a full five is that there is an episode missing from the series. According to the packaging, there are supposed to be episodes about the following animlas Terror Bird, Mosasaur, Spinosaurus, Acrocanthosaurus, Megalania  the Bear Faced Dog. The Bear Faced Dog episode is absent from the DVDs. Now granted they included a bonus documentary called What Killed the Mega Beasts and it was also very good, but what about The Bear Faced Dog? What the Hell? I just really wish that episode had come with the set. I hope that Discovery Channel will release another DVD set with more Mega Beastepisodes and that the Bear Faced Dog will be included. Until then, I am feeling kind of gyped due to the missinig episode."
1,"Worth Reading This is a great book. In my opinion, it gives you good reasons to look at your own beliefs and question them.It inspired me and helped to answer some nagging questions.I recommend this book to all those people out there who ask Why? and sincerely want an answer."
1,"Good to the nexttolast drop As a director considering plays, I found this one to have some good characters, a solid throughline, and plenty of opprortunity to make your own decisions. It would be easy to paint any of the women especially the mother into being a stock character, but the web of relationships expose facets that can create a depth that takes it out of its We gotta get out of this place premise.One might think, though, that the final scene was accidently typed into the script from incomplete notes that Blessing had accidently left in the stack when she sent it off. Luckily, its easy to fix."
1,"It works but good form is a must This Ab wheel does work, but I want to emphasize that you must use good form. I found it helpful to press my feet up against the wall to help steady myself as I pushed out with my arms. Dont try to go too far out when first beginning to use the Ab wheel. It does require some patience as you get your flow. What I like about this Ab wheel is you dont have put anything together  no handle coverings. My boyfriend loves it and he has a six pack."
1,"Not too bad. . .a pretty good read Purchasing this book on a whim I thought it was entertaining but not as good as The Killing Angels and until I discovered that it was one of those what if history books. I almost gave up reading it, but am I glad I did not. It ended up being a very good read. In fact, I could hardly put it down. I do not want to give the plot away, but Gingrich and Forstchen give a very good what if scenario if history had taken a different turn that day.What makes this book especially good in the insight the authors give concerning the life of the everyday solider. They bring us back through history, to the killing fields of Gettysburg, the horrific wounds the soldiers received and the sheer terror of being a foot solider in that great and terrible war.Is it a great book? No, not really, but it is a very good book and worth the read."
1,"Dark is Good Movie was dark as the title make us aware, it created balance to the other films prior where humor and romance dominated without enough real shadow. Ending was somewhat predictable, the need to continue the revenue flow is all to obvious, now we have Robbin and Batwomen to lift bills from our pocketbooks."
1,"Baptist Roots Getting at the Truth of Our Heritage This has to be the best, all inclusive study on Baptist Heritage that I have found. While enlightening in areas of Baptist roots, it also does a wonderful job dispelling many of the myths that have crept into the Baptist Church as to its beginnings. It is a must for anyone interested in the beginnings of the Baptist Church and the forming of their doctrinal statements of faith."
1,"Great book. Very informative. Sean Hannity does it again. I loved his first book, but this one is even better. Sean does an amazing job of setting up good vs. evil. That the acts of some leaders and politicians can only be described as evil. Sean, then takes the readers through many lessons in history to contrast the two basic approaches to dealing with evil confront or appease. There is a very real difference between the appeasement of liberal democrats Clinton and Carter and the show of force used by Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush. The results speak for themselves. Sean makes a very strong case and has definately done his homework, with more historial details and examples than Ive seen since college!"
1,"Great relief for Fibromyalgia I have Fibromyalgia and use biweekly massage therapy to help keep my pain in check. My therapist uses Tiger Balm and I ended up buying my own for use at home in between appointments. Some days, the pain in my thighs, neck and upper back is so bad, I cant sit or lay down in any position for more than  mins, let alone sleep well, even with narcotic pain meds. Out of desperation, I started to apply Tiger Balm before going to work I am on my feet for hours and every night before bed and the RELIEF is REMARKABLE! My muscles get really, really warm and then the pain disappears, almost completely. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND USING TIGER BALM!"
1,"A gentle introduction to Perl For Perl beginners, this book is significantly more readable than the OReilly texts  I would like to have seen even more exercises throughout, though.Overall, a good springboard to a more indepth text, such as the Wrox title Beginning Perl. I deducted one point for a few minor but annoying typographical errors  this book needed one more pass by the technical editor. C programmers will quickly recognize the typos, but these could confuse some beginners.Also, this book covers the Perl DBI using the PostgreSQL database. Installing PostgreSQL is awkward on Windows, yet many beginning Perl developers probably use Windows. The Wrox book Beginning Perl makes the more logical choice of using the MySQL database, which is simpler to install and use on Windows and also runs on most LinuxUnix platforms."
1,"Sophisticated in content, yet highly readable makes The Checklist an important addition to the family library Wading through web pages of information about health care can be cumbersome and confusing. Too often books deal with one illness or issue, but fail to offer the holistic perspective crucial to wellness. Physician visits can be necessarily brief and lead to more questions about how to prioritize follow up. Presented with the wisdom and humor which are the hallmarks of Dr. Manny, The Checklist offers a road map to health throughout the life stages. Sage, expert advice is delivered in a clear format making this not only a MUST READ, but an enjoyable and valuable MUST HAVE. As a clinician specializing in womens reproductive mental health,I especially appreciated Dr. Mannys inclusion of postpartum depression and other mental health issues across the lifespan."
1,"ratm plus chris cornell. good This is a good cd. Its an interesting combination of rage minus de la roche plus cornell. Its definitely not rage, but Morellos solos rip through the tracks, and they just sound cool. In my opinion thats the best part of the cd."
1,"Big, Messy, Heartfelt and Wonderful This is a big, wandering book  but one whose length is justified by the indepth exploration of its main character, the unforgettable Patsy Carpenter. Like a lot of McMurtry books, its sad and funny and imbued with a deep sympathy for peoples flaws and foibles and the situations they somehow get themselves into and then cant get out of. If youre in a relationship thats ended, is ending, or that might end soon, youll find this book to be a bittersweet mirror. It wont help you figure out what to do, but boy will you recognize your own situation."
1,"A surprise for me Not knowing anything about this book, I bought it on a whim. Partly because of the cover, partly because the bookseller had turned it out on the shelf. Partly because I had watched up close the terrible events of that terrible day. But I was not disappointed by this taut and at times poetic tale of the condo dwellers, each with their peculiar fates. The novel is not about , and it is not mawkish or sentimental. Nor is there anything exploitive about the treatment of the World Trade Center tragedy. Instead, I found it very life affirming. The characters were vivid and powerful and easily formed themselves in my imagination. The writing is elegant and simple, and reading the book took no effort at all. I wondered where Rinaldi had come up with the names of some all? of the characters, which sounded improbable to me and a little distracting. But thats just me. All in all, I would highly recommend this as a rewarding read."
1,"A Bible for the Linuxhearted I was delighted to discover that this book and the companion Live CD together accomplish not one but three amazing feats, each for a different audience. First, crack authors Hiser and Adelstein instantly soothe frustrated Windows users by showing how easy and familiar! Linux can be. Second, they help Linux users at every level acclimate quickly to this bestofbreed GNULinux desktop system and its sumptuous harem of applications. Third, the book is written by such savvy Linux and open source veterans that  despite the simple language, step by step instructions and many explicit screenshots  even advanced Linux users and system administrators will find material and new information to hold their interest. In this readers humble opinion a musthave on the road to Linux Enlightenment!"
1,"GEOCACHERS DREAM Ive had my Explorist  for about   years and I love it. Its easy to use and extremely accurate. In open country you can get an accuracy of about  feet. Even in heavily wooded areas you can get within  feet or so and you VERY rarely lose signal.My buddy has a Garmin etrex and a Delorme PN and my Magellan is more accurate than both of his units.You can mark your routes, favorite spots, whatever you want. Geocaching software is fairly good although time consuming to enter all of the info.The only drawbacks are when you find a geocache you cant delete it or mark it as found until you get home and attach the unit to your computer.The USB interface is hard to connect to the unit.And the unit is not in color or topo.Other than that the Explorist  is the geocachers dream. Ive found over  local caches with this baby. A VERY nice starter unit. TeamTrekkerz"

1,"dorky, but my kids love them These are pretty dorky, not fancy, we probably wouldnt use them for halloween costumes. But they are PERFECT for everyday costume play. The fact that theyre just open tunics is actually an advantage for free play, because the kids can easily put these on themselves rather than fancier costumes which are often difficult to get on and off and which definitely need mom or dads assistance. My kids also love that each costume has a variety of accessories arm bands, leg covers, etc., which for some reason they really dig."

1,THE ABSOLUTE BEST Guide to Women EVER! This is a must for any woman who wants a little insight into their own personality. Just read it with an open mind. I think that any person who is into astrology should own this book.
1,"One of the best films ever. period. This is without a doubt Hitchcocks best and is incredible in every way. There is brilliant acting from Mr.Anthony Perkins as well as Janet Leigh. This was a groundbreaking film that changed the face of movies forever. Although its old, the story is one the really caputres you and sends a few chills down your spine. and who could forget the famous s hower sequence! supposedly, after the movie came out, there was a  drop in shower curtain sales. You know a movie is good when it affects sales!"
1,"his own shopping bag my son loves this bag. hell walk around the house with it on his arm, putting things in or taking them out. i wasnt sure hed want to play with a shopping bag, but he does. i think it has been well made  is very kid friendly. we use this to pretend to go shopping using his little play groceries."
1,"Not great literature, but lots of fun I sought this book out because of the authors other  books, which I had read and enjoyed. The storyline was basically one cliffhanger after another, as in the other books. The art of the narrow escape is evidently one of Browns strong points. I had a couple of other books going, but put them aside until I finished this one. My only complaints were that the heroine turns into a wimp at the end and the big secret which all the genuises seek is blatantly obvious to a knowledgeable readeryet they dont see it. Other than that, the book was enjoyable."
1,"The best CD of  Yes, I know Children of Bodom put out AYDY? in , and while I liked it, it was a bit disappointing and I find this to be better. I and Snively already explained how awesome the other  members are, so let me introduce Pete Wilburg, the bands new keyboardist. He adds a new edge to the bands sound by making it a little more atmospheric. The one thing that angers me, though, is that some people said the band sold out because they did their first music video. How fing stupid is that?! It still sounds like the Opeth we know and love. Get this CD. Also check em out at Gigantour."
1,"Not for everyone I never would have thought I would enjoy a show like this. WOW...what a show. Honestly, I could do without the foul language and the nudity and in most cases such would cause me to go elsewhere. But this show is one of the BEST crime dramas Ive ever seen. The main character, Dexter Morgan, is one of the BEST lead characters ever. The supporting cast of characters everyone from his sister to girlfriends to the many police officers are all excellent as well. But wow...the story is soo good! It just pulls you in and keeps you wanting more."

1,"Pretty Good I took a listen to this CD the other day, not really knowing much about Kelly Price, and I was blown away by her vocal power! Although many of the songs on the album are nothing particularly original, Kelly Price sings with such grace and elegance that its hard not to like the album. A big standout on the CD is As We Lay, which shows off Prices amazing talents."
1,"Great Monograph This book is a rare glimpse into the photographic mind of Degas. His artistic life was rich and full, and his ability to master the new medium of photography is evidenced by the beautiful work therein. One can see how one medium informed the other. He was a deep genius."
1,Not neccessarily needed but works great This product does exactly what it says gives you a p connection which is great for those of us that play on hdtvs instead of widening the screens via the tv. But really it doesnt do much the graphics do come out a little sharper and obviously less stretched out. So in my opinion it was well worth the money I spent and works just as good as the st paty would and saves money so I would recommend to those who play on hdtvs but dont expect much out of it.
1,"Moluccan cockatoo This is a nicelysized, plush soft and comfortable cockatoo toy which is an excellent, appealing gift for a child in and of itself. However, the choice of a Moluccan cockatoo is quite unusual and adds to the originality appeal factor its creation must have involved a person knowledgeable about parrots, since it is surprisingly true to life, with the multicolored layered crest and zygodactyl toes."
1,"Great motivator for a future crawler! We bought this for our before he could crawl. He liked putting the balls and other small items down the hole, but it was when it was rolled in front of him did he really enjoy it. He bagan to push it and scoot towards it himself. Evenentually, he started to crawl!This is toy seems like it will last forever! There are few moving parts, and the batteries last for a while also.This is a great inexpensive gift to give an infant."
1,"Interesting historical artifact Feels like In a league of their own, for lifeguarding. The voiceover is a relic of a bygone, sexist era, but the actual work depicted in the film shows some very serious lifeguard training. Although the picture quality is at times quite poor, I would recommend this short DVD to anyone training lifeguards. Some of the training of lifeguards has changed quite a bit, some of the resuscitation techniques of the time are pretty amusing. On the other hand, these women seem to have undergone more rigorous physical training than todays lifeguards, and some principles of vigilance and water rescue really havent changed."
1,"Valuable Info for Library Leaders In this practical guide, experienced author and speaker Walt Crawford shows fellow librarians how to make both their writing and speaking inform and entertain their audiences. summary by South Texas Library SystemIve heard it said that a library director should always have an elevator speech ready, so you dont miss that opportunity with a city commissioner trapped in an elevator with you for  minutes. This book expands on that for librarians needing to write or make presentations. After years of writing a library column and giving library talks to Rotary and other civic groups, I recommend that all librarians read a book like this."
1,"Making It In America  What Immigrants Know and Americans A well written, encouraging book that is not only informative, but entertaining. I felt that Ms Steele encourages all of us to get out of our comfort zone and do what we want, but were afraid to do. This is a must read for everyone! I read it in  hours. I couldnt put it down!Thanks Marcia"
1,"Worth every penny Originally had bought another seat from another store, never took it out of the box and went back and forth in my head on whether or not the Recaro was worth the money...Best decision ive made in a LONG time, taking back the other seat and ordering this. The quality, safety features and comfort it appears to give my daughter is worth it!!She sleeps in it without her head tipping forward, the straps are soft and dont bother her even when snug... the head rest is perfect...highly recommended."
1,Great book for elementary school readers This is a great introduction to a really fantastic story. Great for the elementary student who excels in reading. Weve loved reading this book over  over and enjoyed the story so much that wed purchased three copies for our school library. If your kids are reluctant to read it show them the movie first.
1,"shades of twilight being a twilight fan, and an ardent lover of vampires,werewolves,and anything that goes bump in the night. i appreciate a good movie in that genre. this is a light version of Twilight, and certainly not Carpenters vampires. i enjoyed it, it did catch and keep my interest. i find the little twists that will lead up and onward fun.the cemetary and diary is good and different. although the fog is a little hokey. who knows it may get better as it goes along. i like the fact that it is nt filled with screaming and yelling.i will tune in again."
1,"Beautiful The Amazon reviewer is simnply wrong this is a beautiful listening program. The reviewer is wrong again about these pieces never being played complete in concert in fact I myself have had the pleasure of hearing three different complete performances live. The performances on this disc are perfectly fine, even if they lack the elegance of a Heidsieck or the romantic sweep of a Rubenstein. This disc is well worth investigating, especially at this price."
1,"Yoga Zone, next best thing to a live instructor Ive been practicing yoga for  years and once a week go to a yoga class with an excellent instructor. These Yoga Zone DVDs are the very next best thing to a live teacher. The instructions are very explicit, the pacing is excellent, the variety of poses work all body parts and the final meditational pose is really relaxing and enjoyable. I would recomment all the beginning and this intermediate DVD to anyone."

1,"Nice for rookies! Bought one for my son at a big box store for  more then amazon but was still under . My  lbs son has pulled in  decent fish on it. I am no expert, but dont put too much line on it, it will get line tangled in the gears, and the line it comes with snaps easy my sons did. One of the fish caught was a  lbs  carp, pole held up well! Plastic is lame but their is alot of graphite, and teach your kid to baby his pole anyway right? It is cheaper then the mini poles, and this will last them a while. Buy your kid this pole is your not too rich and want too fish with a rookie. My boy can cast it well and I can send it flying. On the bad side the rod might outlast the reel, buy a  later maybe"
1,Best stroller ever!! I love this stroller!! My husband was about to kill me for spending so much on a stroller. When he had to use his moms  umbrella stroller he finally admitted ours was worth the money. Were both about    so the height is great! My daughter is  months and very tall and she fits in it great. She actually likes this stroller where as we would have to fight her to put her in the regular stroller. I love that it sort of reclines so she can lie back a little and nap. The only problem we had was getting used to not having cup holders and a storage compartment like we did with the Eddie Bauer travel system we had. I bought a mesh bag separately and a couple cup holders from Toys R Us and its not a problem now. I did remove the sunshade though it just seemed to always be in the way. I have recommended this stroller to a lot of people they all think its great too!
1,"This was the best mystery Ive read so far. I love this book! The authors way of writing made you never want put it down. Throughout the whole book, you think you know who did it but the end will blow your mind. What I like best was the ending. It was so sweet. This is Definately a book you will want to read more than once!"
1,Stephen Kings best book ever! THIS IS STEPHEN KINGS BEST BOOK! A MUST READ! The characters are so real that you feel that you are right there with them. The scenes are so scary that you should read during the day! Stephen Kings  bestseller is one that you should NOT miss out on!Anonymous
1,"What a Story! The story started out slow and somewhat hard to follow. Soon after the story itself picked up and became more interesting. I soon grew to realize that this story had depth and a true storyline. I recommend this book to anyone from a high school level and up. I was made to read the book for school but for once, the teachers had picked a wonderful novel!"
1,"What NATURE said about PLANET QUEST Of the three books on extrasolar planets, I like PLANET QUEST best. Ken Croswell has everything needed in a great science writer. He knows his subject and understands the joys, difficulties and frustrations of being an astronomer. He has great skill in interviewing the scientific protagonists and drawing from them the details of the excitement and disappointments of their endeavours many of these interviews are quoted verbatim. And he can tell a superb story, which is compelling and complete. I particularly liked his discussion of the way the media reacted to the new planet news. The book is riveting. And what is more, it has an extensive note and reference section. David W. Hughes, NATURE, vol , p ."
1,"Its a Nice Book First time I heard of Tuck Everlasting I thought the name sounded cool and interesting, so I figured why not try it. Honestly I didnt get it and put the book down, not getting to through the first  pages. Having read it recently thoughthe whole thing, I really liked it. Winnie reminded me of myself in how she stayed faithful to the Tuckers. It was very bittersweet. I only wished it would of went more in depth and there would of been more."
1,Exquisite work Easily the best Joker story ever written. The artwork and coloring are nothing short of amazing as well. If you are looking for some great Joker quotes this contains some of his very best.
1,"I really like this bag I wanted a large bag to more carefully carry my Iphone  but it had to hold all my other stuff too every woman knows what that means. This bag is lovely  but more of a shopping bag. It has so many pockets, zippered, snapped and otherwise that I actually couldnt find my Iphone one day. Go figure! But, Ive got all the different places memorized now and the bag works well for me. I could probably carry a lot more  and will probably do so. Its very attractive and I like the microfiber as it cleans up nicely and works well in the remote Michigan climate I live in."
1,"helps sciatica pain I have arthritis and sciatica and found these exercises make me feel better. When I first did them, I thought some would cause me pain later but it was the exact opposite  they reduced pain. Great stretching exercises."
1,"Jaheims Ghetto Love is worth the purchase!! I dont usually go for whats popular or in heavy rotation on the radio and video stations, but Jaheims voice alone was enough to convince me to buy this album. His voice is the highlight of the album, but there are some really good cuts on here that compliment his singing. Ready, Willing  Able, Looking For Love, Anything, Forever, Happiness and Could It Be are all favorites of mine, but the track that stood out for me was Remarkable, the duet with Terry Dexter. If you think that Jaheim is just some new jack with an album full of cliched and mediocore songs, you are in for a surprise because on this album, Jaheim has some material that holds up among the competition."
1,"Jim Carrey at his finest Bruce Almighty is truly Jim Carrey at his finest. Its amazingly fun, yet uncanningly clean.Jim Carrey finds himself set up in a live TV broadcast and loses it on air after finding out that his rival has been promoted to the news anchor job he coveted. After blowing his lid, Carrey loses his job. In despair, he does what mankind has been doing for centuriesblames God.After a day of moping, God played quite convincingly by Morgan Freeman grants Carrey His powers. Of course, Bruce Almighty wreaks havoc on his professional rival and scoops the big stories by creating disasters as he pleases.The role of God begins to overwhelm him when he answers yes to too many prayer requests and his girlfriend the incredible Jennifer Anniston begins to turn her back on him.In the end, Carrey learns the power of the free will of mankind and learns the beauty of surrender to the will of God.A great movie. Remarkably funny and also very Bibically based. Enjoy!"
1,"Jaws D is a brilliant form of storytelling! Jaws D tends to get a lot of bad press, when in actuality it is a very exciting script with excellent dialogue, excellent performances and some pretty neat special effects. What the viewer must remember is that this was intended to be seen in a D format, if you are given a chance to see it this way, you are in for a pleasant surprise. This was the first film to use D as a tool and not a gimmick. For this reason alone, its an important piece of film history. I realize that for some people its easier to criticize than to praise, I mean to hate sequels....well thats just the thing to do, its a cliche. However, anyone with an open mind and a love for man vs nature will see this film as an exciting adventure, I urge everyone to give this film a second chance...it deserves it!"
1,"Judging the sequel This was an excellent sequel...I loved everyone in it and especially Hank Azaria...he is so funny...what a perfect choice to play the older brother...I laughed all through the movie and have seen it about fives times already...General Custer was great, Amy Adams was great...the Einstein bobble heads were cool and Lincoln was terrific also voice of Hank Azaria Would highly recommend purchase of this DVD from amazon.com"
1,"Great Product I read a lot of reviews before committing to this product. I am really glad I went ahead with it, despite some mediocre reviews. The audio and video are great. I know they will continue to improve this product and I would like to see a longer battery life, and of course, lower price. I would recommend it, and purchase it again.Update  I also have other iPods so this one sat in a drawer for several monthswhen I got it out recently and went to update the software in my iTunes program it would not update and just keeps telling me there is an error of some kind, did I want to clear it off. Yes I did and now it no longer works at allso having paid a ton of money for this originallyit is now useless. I do love Apple products and iPods but this was a huge disappointment to find this little gem will no longer work. I will need to call Apple and find out what to do. Who needs the hassle!"
1,"gets the job done I am quite happy with the results i have gotten from this unit. It seems that many people have had issues with the heat button no turning off, mine does not have this problem. It functions as advertised. So far i have used it to clean jewelry and nitro RC car parts. It makes gems really sparkle, and gets precious metals quite clean. It does a very good job of getting engine parts much more thoroughly clean than any other method, including a solvent tank, since you cant get into the internal areas with a brush. I would definitely recommend this product to any RC hobbyist."
1,"Fluenz Mandarin  A Good Choice! I thoroughly recommend this product to learn Mandarin. I think that it has the right combination of native speakers and explanations in English. It gives you enough opportunities to hear the native speaker, the choice whether or not to see the english translation and the pinyin writing combined with the voice, and to write your own sentences and words in Pinyin. It also gives you enough opportunity to record your voice and to compare it with that of the native speaker. It allows you to repeat and fast forward as you wish."
1,Wicked Charleston  wickedly interesting Who would have ever guessed that such an apparently genteel and gracious Southern city would have such skeletons in its closets to use a cliche. Very interesting reading
1,"The Perfect MurderFrame If I ever desired to kill my spouse and frame someone else, this story is a very good blueprint for success. This Agatha Christie has everything, Mystery, Romance, intrigue. Every woman wishes she were beautiful, charming and was the type for men to fall in love with."
1,Brave young women reveal the humanity in themselves and their violator Flawed but very compelling docu about a tight knit group of women who confront their abuser of approximately twenty five years previous . Fascinating streaming . Most women and im sure many men can identify . It need not have happened to you to appreciate the story and people involved .
1,"Great Visual Material If you are expecting a book on how to then this book is probably not going to fulfill your needs. However, this book does provide the viewer with a pethora visual inspiration. Many of the images in this book are innovative, provocative, and a great resource for makeup artistry. The colors are bright and vivid and the makeup artistry is boundless. I certainly have enjoyed sharing this material with my fellow makeup artists."
1,"Wonderful books for learning basic concepts My  month old loves these books. They are the sturdiest Ive seen and they present the basic concepts of numbers, shapes, colors and opposites in the most basic simple form. They are perfect for toddlers. My son has learned to identify and say all of the colors except orange  a bit of a tongue twister for him, the numbers from one to ten, about half the shapes and several opposites. He reads these books to himself at least once a day. It is the sweatest thing to see him turn a page and say pink pig. He also asks me to read them to him frequently. They have held his attention more than any other book or toy he owns. I would highly recommend these books."
1,"A must read The Da Vinci Code is an amazing book. It has action, and has some surprising educational information. However, if you read it, you shouldnt actually go to the places these people went and expect to find some kind of treasure. Because you wont find it. The book is fiction, so just read it for the thrill and mystery and dont go putting yourself into the main characters shoes!Its a good book!"
1,angels eyes for dogs i tried to get hold of the person i bought this from because it was suppost to be a new bottle. it was only alittle more than half full  was one of their used items. i paid like . for it too. i am not very happy about it  will not order from amazon again. also you never hear from the sellers after you bought their item like feedback etc.
1,"GREAT PICTURES, QUALITY CAMERA, LOTS OF FEATURES Ive owned a digital camera since . This is my second camera purchased after doing a lot of research. I am very pleased with the camera. Its easy to operate. There are so many features to the camera, but it can still be treated like a point and shoot. The quality of the camera exceeded my expectations. The pictures are clear, sharp, and have the most vivid colors. Im looking forward to years of great pictures with this camera."
1,"The low price just means the price is low, not about quality. I purchased this set because its low price, however the quality is far better than you can expect for the money you pay. I have a Gorham Monet flatware set, which is not as good as this Yamazaki. I know figures may be better than my words to make you believe that. The Yamazaki fork  gram, spoon g VS g Gorham fork and g spoon.If you budget is  for  people set, I think that you can hardly find better one. So do not use it is what you pay for  to rule this . set.but, something I do not like . coming in white box, which looks like the auto parts if I do not open the package, and of course can not be used as gift. . made inChina sign marked in every piece."
1,"The Defiant Onesno wonder it was nominated for all those Oscars. Although minimal by todays Hollywood standards, this drama stimulates discussion on many levels. Some of it is obviously dated, but it is worthwhile seeing from the standpoint of cinematic storytelling, basic cinematic technique, and basic dramatic performances without excessive explosions, graphic sex or verbal profanity. Highly recommended for the movie enthusiasist."
1,"My favorite Cookbook!!! I would give this Betty Crocker Bisquick cookbook more than  stars it there was a place for it.I have been using this book for awhile now. I take it with me as I travel alot and everything in it is so very easy to make and so tasty, I have not found a person yet who has not liked something I have cooked from it. It is a keeper"
1,"Great confidence. . . so far This starter is made great by a couple of features Its American made and it is new, backed by a very good warranty. In combination with the starter I bought an alternator from QB, so far so great after  months. Ill update in six months from now.Update April , This starter and the alternator are still going strong, its living up to its warranty as well. Great products, American company. Very pleased.Update December , Still going strong after  mos., great products, great company, very very pleased."
1,"wish teaser sets price was lower, great series... i was surprised at how well this method works ! I would highly reccomend pimsleur series, i wish I had this for other languages I have studied in the past.my only complaint is that if they really want you to buy the full series, this teaser  lesson set should be much cheaper. I didnt realize i was getting such a small slice of the entire program. You really learn to say a relatively small set of phrases. I would also expect that the conversational set, which has only  more languages, is even more of a rip off.i purchased this program the smallestcheapest pimsleur set available in order to just get my feet wet to learning DARI, as the actual DARI dialect program is not being released until midSeptember...will just buy the complete program and skip the basic and conversational packages..."
1,A book of Bucket List dives You could spend a lifetime doing all the dive sites in this book. Your life would be vastly enriched if you did too. Definately a great text to have for planning vacations and dive trips any where in the world. Two thumbs up. Go Pro this year!!!
1,"Yes, play gamecube basically anywhere! This is a great item to buy. I think for its price it is very worth it. I WOULD pay  dollars for this. For those who wonder, it does not take batteries. There are cords, but they allow you to play in the car with the lighter slot. You can also play without a T.V. in a house. For example. When I go to my uncles house in Florida for vaccation. When I am board I play gamecube, because my uncle only has one T.V, and he always watches golf. I used to get board to death, but not now. This is a must for gamecube! You dont have to sqint either."
1,"Techno? no, no... Its kinda funny... people see the word remix and start thinking the word techno. This isnt techno. I havent heard the entire cd, just the samples, and I can definitely say that this is NOT techno. Its got some electronic elements and some bleeps and bloops, but that does not constitute techno. Also, I read someone say that this was the first major christian remix album. Somebody forgot Toby Macs Momentum Remixed cd. All in all, Id still say this sounds pretty sweet."
1,"Our Sacred Honor... As always, Bennett tosses us a great story about our founding fathers. His writing is coordinated and he points out the best of the dramatic tales real that they enduredas individuals, as well as family heads. If only, when future historians look back on our current days, they would be able to say...Those were great days. Alas, I doubt it. Although the founders were what might be called normal mortals, to challenge each other to create our great nation makes one proud to be able to say we belong! They were clearly heroes."
1,It All Good! This is an excellent work of art. Every song on the casette that I have speaks to me. My favorite is Touch Me. The lead vocalist has a soprano octave that will knock your socks off. Edwin uses LaShun Pace and John P. Kee on this one and another seminar LP I have. Note This is when John and LaShun were not even on the gospel charts as original artists. This one is one of my many Hawkins collections. God Bless all who purchase it! You wont be dissapointed.
1,"Toner cartridge as good as new This replacement toner cartridge is advertised as compatible with the original. Indeed, it works very well right out of the box, in the ML printer. The print seems somewhat darker than with the original, so I use the light setting in the printer options, to save on toner. Because of this minor difference I only gave the cartridge  stars rather than . A similar cartridge has been working for me in another printer for  months without fail."
1,"Its Awesome I used to hate Avril.My mom bought her cd for me and now i luv her!!!!! She is so awesome.Her voice is amazing.She is my idol.I luv her cd, it is the best cd I have i have alot of cds.So buy the cd, it rocks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

1,A must get If you can find it This CD set was released in  then withdrawn quickly due to legal problems with Greg Allman and others.Its a shame because its a lovingly produced set that contains many demos and classic songs Greg recorded during his solo career.A must get if you can find one.
1,"Recommended for philosophy and college library shelves The Cosmopolitan Self George Herbert Mead And Continental Philosophy is a thoughtprovoking commentary by Mitchell Aboulafia Professor of Philosophy, Pennsylvania State University on the pragmatic insights of American philosopher George Herbert Mead. Examining Meads precepts with regard to pluralism, universalism, and nurturing a temperament and environment where democracy can thrive, The Cosmopolitan Self draws insight by comparing Mead to the assertions of other philosophers in search of the most relevant, accurate, and justifiable conclusions. Extensive notes and an index round out this thoughtful critique, especially recommended for philosophy and college library shelves."
1,"Nice Manifold I used this on my outdoor hose outlet and it works fine. No leaks.The water valves are ball type and the large valve handles are very easy to control. The major considerations to make before buying this is to ask yourself if you are going to keep removing and reattaching hoses and also if there is any chance of rough handling ie hard tugging at fully extended hoses, etc... If the answer is yes to any of the above then Id recommend a brass or aluminum set. And dont force hoses on as you are likely to cross thread them  just go easy and youll be fine."
1,"DEFINITIVE CASE STUDY Having recently finished Close to Shore  another book about the  New Jersey shark attacks I was keen to read Richard Fernicolas Twelve Days of Terror.
