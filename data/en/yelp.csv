0,"I had a pretty terrible experience today!nnFirst me and my friend walked in and requested to sit outside on the patio since it was a beautiful day, the hostess told us to go ahead and seat ourselves, no problem. We went to go sit at a table and the party in front of us received menus and the hostess completely forgot to give us some and had no intentions on returning with any menus. We sat and waited for a few minutes then a busy server saw us getting impatient and grabbed us menus. We wanted cocktails and an appetizer but it took a while for the server to return. After about  minutes waiting to even see the server after receiving the menus we place our entire order. Things were going fine after that, food came out in a timely manner and was pretty tasty. Then I was pretty disgusted with what happened next, the hostess was walking around the patio, grabbed a full glass of water from a dirty table and gave it to my friend thinking she was doing her a favor by refilling her water!!! GROSSS! We decided not to make a big deal but when telling the server about it, he seemed to not even care and made it seem like we were crazy. We then finished our food and left. Probably never going back there again. Terrible service and all the staff seemed like they hated life. Not good!"
0,"The food was good, but it doesnt outweigh the management practices. The experience was bordering on a nightmare. Definitely a stressful and extremely unpleasant dream.nnGraduation day at U of I. Reservations were made far in advance. We had a pm reservation with a  required deposit. When we walked in a few minutes before , we found ourselves shoulder to shoulder with angry and annoyed patrons. We spoke to several people who had been waiting to be seated , , and even  and a half hours AFTER their reservation time. They know how to take a reservation, just not how to keep the reservation. And thats really the most important part of the reservation.nnSo, due to the  required credit card deposit, all those people were stuck waiting and waiting and waiting. After waiting an hour, we asked what would happen if we left, and they said they would charge us . Im pretty sure this wouldnt hold up in a court of law, but the small claims filing fee is more than  so they have people hooked. nnWhen we were finally seated an hour and a half after our reservation time, the  of us were squished into a small booth with a chair at the end. There was no space for that chair. It was very uncomfortable. Were our drinks comped? Were we offered anything for our long wait? No. nnThe server was very nice, but we were starved and exhausted and really annoyed. The food was great, but way overpriced. I had little parcels pasta filled with cheese. Really great. The taste was worth  stars. nnI find managements policy on the U of I graduation date coupled with their failure to keep reservations absolutely unacceptable. It is completely unnecessary, their restaurant would be packed skipped reservations or not. The management decided to take this opportunity to swindle people."
0,"I couldnt see her face all night, so honestly I wouldnt have known if it was her dancingsinging or an imposture. Also she barely spoke to the crowd all night, other than the standard Hey Vegas. The lines for the bar were ridiculously long and SLOW moving, Im shocked that they dont staff more people."
0,"Note to self chicken tacos here are horrible, terrible, deplorable, with out a welcome taste, a full on insult to my palette, flies would turn them down, marooned sailors would rather chew sand than eat these, so bad that a cat falling in the mix would be a welcome addition, so poorly seasoned and dry that I got more moisture and flavor from the cabbage. On the bright side when I throw this up in a bit my dinner from last night will make it taste better going up than it did going down! nnIf this place has been here for over  years it certainly had zero to do with chicken taco sales or the business is actually a front for a money laundering operation for the mob! The owner did look Italian..nnMy sister and nieces company niece wisely chose not to eat did make it slightly bearable though..nnNext time I will have the fish tacos so many other people on here review well and hope for the best.nn I still cant get over the nasty chicken tacos, the owner needs to try his competitions tacos and refine his, if a stand in baja in the middle of no where can get it right with limited resources he should be able to get it right too.nnP.S. the horchada didnt suck."
0,"Cappuccino Machine was broken, and they lost our order. I went up to the counter where the dude making breakfasts was just standing there looking at tickets and not moving. I asked about my order and he couldnt find it. Manager came out and there was a flurry of activity, but bagelboy glared at me like I had done something wrong. I had, I went to Paradise Bakery"
0,"This club sucks. The club is cramped. There is no room for dancing, sitting, resting. There is an outside patiodeck, but thats the only thing. The music is played through a computer and they do not finish all the songs. The kind of play them as if you were using that Winamp extension where you fade in and out of songs. Crappy."
0,"I was very disappointed in your business this morning. I had a rock chip in my windshield that I needed repaired. I went to Store  in West Valley Phoenix and they said there glass guy was a store ,  minutes away. When I went to Store , they said the glass guy was not their. Thank you very much for wasting my time on my morning off. I will not be a customer at any of your locations again."
0,"Lets see it took  minutes just to get a cocktail menu.  I dont believe we got our dinner menus for about  minutes after we asked for them.  I asked the water guy if this is normal and he said I work at another fine dining establishment, yes we do it there.  Ive been to most of the upper end restaurants throughout the strip and never had to wait like that.  Having said that Giadas is hardly fine dining.  Our table was in the bar area.   We ordered our appetizers and thought they were ok, but nothing really to write home about.  Once dinner arrived, they brought not only  wrong order, but .  The waiter put it in the system incorrectly.  They ended up comping both.  nnThe saving grace was the dessert cart. nnPutting service aside because every now and then a restaurant will fail on service for a very similar price and views Bellagio fountains, the food at Scarpetta blows Giadas out of the water.  nnI did voice my concerns to the manager via email only to receive a canned email."
0,"The Jerrys on Thomas used to have good food but over the last few months something has changed.  If one meal were bad, I would go back, and I did but all three meals over the last few months have been kind of icky.  My last visit was on  and Ill have to say that was my last meal at this Jerrys."
0,"NICE ROOM BUT MONEY STOLEN FROM MY BAG INSIDE MY ROOM!!nnIt was nice when we arrived. The front desk was very nice and the room was better than expected. But thats when it got bad. We stayed two nights for my friends bachelor party. So as you would expect, we would sleep in until about noon. Housekeeping entered our room both days without knocking and began servicing our room without even asking. After our room was serviced, we went to the strip during the day. We come back and our keys dont work. Security let us in. When we finally got into our room, I noticed my bag was open and items were not where I had left them.  cash and my Oakley sunglasses case were missing. I called security to report it and they were very friendly and apologetic. I filled out a report with them and was told I would be contacted within  hours.nnBy the time the report was filed and I got back to the room, my new key that front desk had just made for me, did not work. Called the front desk who sent an engineer to look at the door. The engineer was friendly and said it was an issue with the keys, not the door. We went back downstairs to the front desk to get another set of keys. These keys finally worked. By this time, it was pm and the line to the club we were going to was very long. The staff for the club said it would take at least two hours to get in from where we were in line. We had planned on being in line at pm, but because of the circumstances above, we were not able to do so.nnOur plan to go to the club was ruined and we ended up walking the strip back to the hotel as all the other clubs were just as busy. So the bachelor missed out on the club he wanted to go to.nnAt checkout the next day, I mentioned the stolen money to the concierge agent. There was no apology. She just said risk management would get back to me in  hours.nnWe checked out Sunday and the money was reported missing on Saturday. I had not received any call by Tuesday, so I left a message with risk management Tuesday night. I did not receive a call by pm Wednesday so I called and left another message. They called me back at pm Wednesday to tell me it was a busy weekend and they hadnt started the investigation of my stolen money yet and would call me back when the investigation was completed. And she wanted to make it clear that the hotel is not responsible for any stolen belongings unless they are in the room safe.nnSo five days after my money and sunglasses case were stolen from my closed bag, I have no answers. It seems the hotel allows their employees to go into guests bags and take anything they want."
0,"Was here recently and service was terrible plus food was not as tasty as it has been at other Macaroni Grills I have been to.  Our waitress disappeared for a good  minutes before she even brought us water.Took forever to get our food and it was mediocre.  I was really surprised because I have eaten at several Macaroni Grills in valley, Tucson and in other states."
0,"Ive been here twice, the first time I thought the food was bad. Went back a nd time because I was out there again and there is really no where else to go. Figured, food cant be as bad as I remember. It was, maybe worse the nd time. Service wasnt good either. I love Mexican food, but his just is not good."
0,Most expensive pedi package consists of polish and cuticles and a little lotion thats it..it is a mall kiosk so no foot soak etc.  Also there are two pedi chairs so the speak virtually right next to each other..they share an armrest..they are unable to remove gel color so let me advise anyone who has gel on toes or nails to not go here..they basically take off your gel with a dremel tool.. i
0,years I waited for this slop. Everything was lukewarm at best. Desserts that were supposed to be cold were warm. My  dollar cocktail gave me a good buzz for  minutes so  star for that. nd star is for service. Remember people...its a buffet. Lower your expectations or you will be slapped in the face by disappointment like myself.
0,"Sorry, but Tao is just overrated nYes, its crackin... but to a point where its waaaay too crowded and seriously becomes a fire hazard...you really cant dance at all here.nAlso, the bouncers there are so rude!! nThat is all."
0,"My coworker and I decided to make a change for lunch today and hit Arbys. Were not strangers to Arbys but I wouldnt say were regulars either so we decided to take a look at the online menu. I found a Market Fresh Farmers Chopped Salad that looked pretty good so decided to order that. When we arrived at Arbys they tell us they dont have any such salad. Now with Yum brands at least their restaurant websites will tell you at participating locations this Arbys location offered no explanation. Now because my coworker and I split the bill for lunch when we return to the office amongst each other a receipt is required to do so. Well no receipt either. If that wasnt enough, when it was time to dig in and eat we also discovered that the Arbys sauce we requested was nonexistent... My alternate food choice was amazing but the service and experience.. meh."

0,"I give this place  stars because of the new car buying experience. I have always owned an Acura and never really encountered problems with buying a new car. I was referred to a salesman Chip, who by the way is amazing!!! He wasnt there at the time and  I wanted to purchase a brand new car, so I saw the next salesman named Steve W. He was just as amazing as Chip. He worked with us throughout our process and was incredibly patient with us. nnAt the end of our car buying, we had a bump in the road and had a huge misunderstanding about the price of the car. Steve W. remained professional and patient with us. When the sales manager, Chris B. came out, he wasnt happy with us. He was a tad bit short tempered with us and made us feel like crap. It ruined my experience with buying a car with Acura, which is probably the reason why I am looking in Henderson or California to buy has a much more competitive price as well. Chris B. was nice when he thought we were going to buy the car, but the fangs came out when we decided not to. I think he could have handled it a little better without being so rude at the end, considering he is a sales manager and represents the company. He made us feel stupid the way he talked to us and belittled us. nnAll in all, I give FIVE stars to Steve W. and Chip for always making me feel welcomed. They are amazing salesmen that will never make you feel like crap and never pushy."
0,"Way overpriced for what you get. Also, the line is a gazillion miles long hr wait on Christmas starting at pm? so dont expect to get in right away!nnThe interior of this place is gorgeous and priceappropriate. Everything is clean and fresh. The buffet itself is huuuge, but there is no way youre going to be able to try everything, so dont even attempt. We tried. Didnt succeed.nnFood I found mehwould eat againn Beef wellingtonn Tunasalmon poke salads yay! raw fish yum!n Sausage hard to mess upn Stuffing I loooove stuffing but it was a bit dryn Sushi  was okay, but if theyre gonna serve sushi and call it fancy, theyre going to have to get a properly trained sushi chef. The rolls were fine, but the nigiri looked like it had been assembled by a toddler. Okay Im exaggerating, but you get my point.nnFood I found blehn Christmas goose super dryn Snow and king crab legs wayyyyy over salted and cooked to the point of toughnessn The flan was gross. I couldnt get myself to eat more than  bite, and flan is usually my absolute favorite dessert.nnMy favoritesn Roasted veggies mmmmn The premade salads were all delishn Smoked salmon but isnt it the same everywhere?n Shrimp cocktail the shrimp here are HUGE and cooked to the point where they are nice and juicy, but not chewy!n Desserts were pretty goodand gorgeously plated. They had cheesecakes, various mini cakes and cupcakes, soft serve, chocolate covered strawberries, fruit tarts, and giant MACARONS! The chocolate macaron I managed to snag made me really happy these things are hard to get! but they ran out on my second trip, so .nnMaybe because it was Christmas dinner, things were not up to the normal standard, but shouldnt it be better?nnCosts more during holidays aka week of Christmas to New Years"
0,"Played yesterday at Royal Links with my wife.nThe good nice story about some of the holes that are in the British Open, very friendly staff, nice practice facility, good cheeseburgernnThe bad they do not overseed in the winter so you are hitting off of dormant Bermuda.. It is hard to see the ball and it is not visually appealing. The reason given is they were burned by a heat wave one year. I appreciate the honesty, but seriously you are going to charge north of player and cheap out on the proper care and maintenance. Never saw that in Scottsdale or Palm Desert.  The rental clubs are older Callaway Razr that were not in the best of condition. Another gimmick is a beat the pro on a par three. There is no pro. Basically you bet that you will hit the green. If you dont, whatever you bet, you get in a gift certificate to the pro shop. If you do, you get some additional bonus added to the gift certificate. I had looked in the pro shop while there and nothing caught my eye. It lessened the experience. Final bad part is that you are nowhere close to a place taxis go, so they call one for you. It took over an hour to get picked up.nnConclusion Not enough value given the price, cannot recommend until they do the right thing with maintenance."
0,"They were accommodating as I wanted the special baked pasta but without the meat. It was tasty, though one mushroom barely constitutes listing it as an ingredient. The meal delivery was slow in comparison to the limited number of customers. I found the prices a little steep for the quantityquality received. I would not recommend unless you are staying in the hotel and get a discount or points."
0,"Quite a crappy place! Bad lunch. I had the Reuben sandwich which was a specialty of the day. This arrived with cold fries. The Reuben was built with sauerkraut right out of the jar and corned beef that came from a processed coldcut package. Not even the shittiest Korean deli makes a sandwich this awful.nnThere is something called Parkes Law that states upon arrival, if you look around the restaurant and evaluate the open and available tables, you will be taken to the least desirable table. I have eaten at BlackThorne twice and twice Parkes Law has been in effect.nnSkip the dining experience that is known as ... BlackThorne!"
0,Terrible service today and the past  weeks. Ive been a valuable customer the past month and they keep changing prices on me and managent has no idea what is going on. One manager says one thing and the other says something else. I called my special  order in at am this morning and the guy on the phone had me repeat my order several times and couldnt get it right still so his manager took my order and once again she didnt even get it right. On top of that my order has been the same for the past month. Anyways today I got there at  because when I called it in tjeu said itd be ready by noon. I got there at  and they didnt even start my order. The manager made me stand there waiting for something that hasnt even been started.  I got there and literally waiting  minutes till I said can I get my juices and she said  more minutes. . Well  minutes later its ready. They finally got it... just took wayyy too long and they were so unorganized.  Plus once I placed my order I also heard the managers bicker and fight. They dont have a mute button on the phone so u can hear all of their conversations. Not classy

0,"Maybe we came on a bad night but that was so not impressive. Some of the worst service Ive had in a while. They took forever to take our order in a non crowded restaurant. I barely remember what we got due to starvation messing with my brain that night.nHowever I do remember that we ordered four quail eggs for two people, and they came in one dish. One. Even if that was for one person, four eggs on a little plate? How did you expect us to eat that I wonder. Also the sashiminigiri is definitely priced above the quality."
0,"Why did I not check the reviews first?!! Thrifty is the absolute WORST car rental service here in Las Vegas. Took almost an hour and  minutes of waiting IN LINE to get the rental car. Hardly any people working the counters and a line of people just waiting!! All the other car rental places here had people in and out quickly. Not Thrifty! That would be too easy! Do you have time to waste in line while spending a weekend in Vegas?! Want terrible service? Thrifty is for you. For the rest of us, I will never use Thrifty again!! You only make this kind of mistake once. How is this rental service even is business?! Hilarious!! Ps. After we did FINALLY get our rental car, for some reason, the car smelled like stinky feet. YOU ARE KILLIN US THRIFTY!!! Worst service, worst rental cars  winning combo! Sense my sarcasm yet?! Humor is all you can have when dealing with Thrifty. Sure it is cheaper than the rest  but trust me when I tell you your time is more valuable!!"
0,"WORST WINGS EVER!! How can they be so disgusting?? I got sick after trying to eat two wings. And by try, I mean I took the skin off to allow all the grease to drain, yes DRAIN, from under the skin before taking a bite. They were slimy, oily, and unflavorful even with spicy garlic sauce.  After pointing this out to the waitress, she informed us that they no longer had a grill...and everything is fried. Period. You have a restaurant.... your main food is chicken wings and you dont have a grill? Disgusting disgusting disgusting. After an hour my stomach was upset and I felt like I was going to heave. Not going back there, not sure what I was thinking since there is a brewery right next door."
0,"I had fun, its a beautiful place.  The service was really good and I love buffet dining.  Heres the thing.  The food ranged from bad to just ok.  I am there for the food.  There are a couple reviews about this restaurant that exclaim that its the best buffet ever.  I should have really ignored them and focused on all the more critical reviews on this restaurant as they really rang true.  Normally when the reviews are this mixed I stay far away.  nnI dont know where to begin.  How about the omelet station.  It takes a tremendous amount of skill to make a good omelet on a flat top.  It just isnt done this way.  You have to spread out a lot of egg and quickly fold it onto itself to give it any depth.  If you leave it flat, its done before you can warm any ingredients or melt any cheese.  I watched rubbery brown thin wrappers of egg surround cold and bland ingredients flow from a well meaning omelet station attendant.  How could you? nnI didnt realize it until later but if youre looking for the french toast, its hidden in back of the omelet station in a hotel pan.  I never did find it until we were on our way out the door.  nnThe best  things about this brunch were the automatic donut machine and the bagels.  Neither of which this place makes on their own.  In fact, I noted quite a few things they dont actually prepare here at all.  nnThe meat carving station looked nice and I chose the Gobi Dessert of pork loins.  It isnt  and you dont have to cook pork within an inch of its life anymore.  There wasnt anyone in the kitchen today that knows how lean a cut this is and how if youre going to put it out on a carving station it should be cooked til slightly pink in the center. nnThe desert station isnt worth my time to talk about.  There isnt a real pastry chef there and the cookies were clearly out of a box.  The chocolate cake tasted like Duncan Hines with the frosting that you get out of a can.  Another sad and depressing effort here in the Burgh.  Sigh."
0,"We came here at around  AM...nn stars for being open late... but everything else was a disappointment.  We got the Mongolian Beef beef was chewy and often times not even able to be swallowed.  Won Ton Egg Noodle Soup broth was okay, but the wontons seemed undercooked and had an odd flavor, and the noodles were kind of hard and undercooked... the chicken fried rice was slightly better... but the egg was an alarming shade of orange and the rice tasted bland and pretty flavorless.. with very small pieces of chicken. nnWe were hoping for better, but unfortunately we left disappointed with out eating much of the food we had ordered."
0,"Beware The following review contains spoilers. nnHandy capped dude gets turned into a vampire.nnThats about it.nnWow. Just wow. We spent the entire time that we managed to stay there trying not to burst out into laughter. nnThis show..well...IT BITES. It BLOWS. It SUCKS and the cherry was when we were trying to slip out of the show one of the performers walks by us and growls at us. nnYes. We couldnt help but start laughing then.nnThe only pros? Boobies. But you can see those all over Vegas, they seem to grow on trees. nnSave yourself the torture and just lose your money at the slots  it might be a better time."
0,"Got a Tixtonight coupon and went here at pm after a show. The food was horrible and the couple next to us agreed. I saw the waiters take a lot of full plates from tables as a lot of it wasnt even edible.

0,"I am a member of another gym which I frequent for most of my workouts but I needed a pool, too so I got a membership here, as well. The pool is good, its kept at a cooler temperature, which is nice gets your more ready for open water swims in events and its not crowded. Overall, the gym layout is odd and wending your way through the mess of cardio machines to get to the locker rooms is a little bit tough. The locker rooms are eh. They arent very nice and are very basic, but thats fine since I dont spend much time in there anyway. Their class schedule, which I have reviewed but dont intend to use is very sparse! My other gym has over a dozen classes a day but this place has a dozen in a week. However, for convenience of a morning swim on my way to work, it is fine. Though its not top notch by any stretch and I have had to avoid a cleaning crew vacuuming around my treadmill which was a little annoying for what it is, its fine. And the prices are decent."
0,"Full Circle is the WORST Car wash I have ever been too! A few months ago I went to the Full Circle by Superstition Mall, they were VERY high pressured to get the MOST expensive  PLUS wash, when I said NO and went with the . wash they did a HORRIBLE job. I got home and realized the back was not vacumed, there were still fingerprints on the windows MANY water spots, to mention a few.  I called and complained, they said to bring it back and they would redo it, I refused to go to that one and brought it to the one on Stapley and Baseline.  They did a great job there making up for the HORRIBLE service at the other location.  So today, I decided to go back to the Stapely location since they did a good job fixing the mistake of the other location. Once again, very HIGH pressured to get the , yes  wash! Again I declined and got the . wash. They too did a HORRIBLE job! Windows still are dirty, water spots like crazy, crumbs still on back seat and under floor mats! Just disgraceful! If they cannot do a simple car wash well, why would anyone want to get the better car wash? I wont even call back this time. I wrote to corporate and am demanding a FULL refund! There is no way I will ever go to any Full Circle  again! They are all the same bad customer service, pushy, and all horrible car wash! i have proceeded to tell everyone I know, Kids schools, dance schools and the neighboring businesses to Full Circle.  This place will better serve the community by being Shut down."

0,"I love pizza after drinking, and our first night, we all got slices. The pizza was super salty and bread was a bit cardboard tasting like?

0,"Disgusting.  Going to this airport is like going to the shittiest casino ever.  It smells, looks and acts like a shitty casino.  The good news is that if youre in Vegas for the first time the airport gets you ready for what youre in for.

0,"Went to Baja Joes for lunch.  I ordered the two fish tacos lunch special.  It was okay.  It is worth noting that there is no host at the door, and there were many people waiting to be acknowledged including me.

0,"Ordered sashimi salad, teriyaki chicken, roll and kimchi soup.nSashimi smelled like fish even with strong sauce, teriyaki chicken meat was dry, the rice inside roll had old smell.nAlso waitress we had was no smile with princess attitude.nOverall,would not recommend to go there!"
0,"I picked up a cupcake from here and was not impressed. The interior was dark and they had hardly anything on display. There are huge fridges around the dining area but they are just stainless steel, not display cases.  It was a cloudy day outside and it made the inside seem pretty dismal. It was in the afternoon, so that may be why they only had a few things for sale. The place was pretty empty and they helped me pretty fast.  nThe cupcake was vanilla and it was moist, but the icing was a disappointment. It just tasted like sugary shortening. I threw it out because it just wasnt worth the trouble of eating."
0,It was good! But the wonton ooOomg there was nothing inside and I called the restaurant and the lady said there was only Tiiiiiiiny tiny bits of chicken! LOL Wich is a lie cos there was none!!! nWhy Lie?
0,Horribly disappointing! I love healthy juicesmoothie places and this one is on my way to work. I got an offer on Facebook for a half off deal and went this evening to try it out. There is no hours of operation sign posted but the door was open so I went in. It was pm on a Monday. There was no one behind the counter and I had to call out to the person in the back room. She said sorry were closed but then another guy came over and said they could serve me. Well then I was turned away because they already cashed out the till for the evening. I left with no juice or smoothie only a sore taste in my mouth. Poor customer service for a new business in town. Ill keep going to Tropical Smoothi one mile down the road.
0,This place is awful wish i had read the reviews before renting from them. NEVER AGAIN. Yes two shuttles to get u there wait an hour just to do contract another  min to get car. The car had a lot of dings and scratches on it and inside grungy looking. They charged more then the online reservation by adding vechicle fee.  Could have got it just as cheap through other sites would have if id known what a joke this place is.
0,"Owner is crazy, actually really like the food there veggies that is, but wont ever go again.  Ive never felt so uncomfortable or offended as I did the last time I visited this place.  I could write a book about this experance, but really is there a need?  Clearly Im not the only one.  Owner was rude."
0,"Went there Sunday while on a bike ride with friends.  Service was glacially slow, even standing in line at the bar window took forever.  Food, when it arrived was good, but management needs to look at streamlining how things flow through their shop."
0,Ive been to the OG Pizzeria Bianco and I have no idea whats wrong with this location. The other one was great! The food was pretty good but the service was horrid. Our waitress was mediocre at best and it was problem after problem with this place. Ill give Pizzeria Bianco one more try but never at this location.
0,"This restaurant is mediocre at best. Atmosphere is lovely however the poor food quality is why we wont return. I think they are more caught up in the concept of the restaurant than the actual flavor and presentation of the food. The farm to table concept works well if you can enjoy the flavor of the ingredients which we could not. Most dishes were extremely salty, so much that I could not taste the tuna, avocado or scallops in the dishes. Brussels sprouts were burned beyond recognition. The mac and cheese came swimming in the au jus of the chicken dish rather than on the side, so the entree was a soupy mess of watered down flavors. Staff was pleasant and heard our feedback. I am curious if the chefs are even tasting the food before it goes out. Overall very disappointed with this place and wont be back."
0,"The only thing going for Salty Senoritas is its location in Old Town Scottsdale. Ive only eaten there once and left with a pricey stomach ache. Seems to be the trend at this restaurant. Ill take my Cinco de Mayo to Fox Restaurant Concepts, Blanco and enjoy great food in a great atmosphere."
0,"I visit Vegas about three to four times a year.  I usually stay at MGM properties and now I know why.  The Venetian is horrible this is a list of the reasons why this hotel is awfulnn. When I arrived I found a beer bottle cap on the couch, yuck is that how they cleaned the rest of the room?nn. Not enough towels, only  three small bath towels for the suitenn. No headphone cord to plug my MP player into the radio or TV.  When I called to request one they said the IT department was closed for the night.  Every other hotel Ive stayed at provides those cords automatically in every room.nn. Staff at Morels restaurant in the Palazzo are rude, even the manager.  The manager refused to provide us with a  off discount because I forgot the coupon in my room.  So, I had to walk to my room in the Venetian and go back to the Pallazo  mins walk each way.  Rude!  When I came back he said he took the  off anyways, that he just misunderstood me...whatever I speak clear English and everyone else at our table of  understood.nn. Staff at clubTao were also rude.  The concierge desk confirmed that we would be on the list for free entrance but the bouncers would not even check for our names.nn. When I spoke to a Jacob he said he was the manager at the front desk he said there was nothing he or the Venetian could do about the restaurant or the club because they were separate from the hotel.nnIn summary, stay somewhere else.  The Wynn and Aria have much better customer service.  Dont waste your money and dont let the Venetian ruin your fun in Vegas.  Stay elsewhere."
0,"Met a friend for Dinner and it was an ok experience. The positive is the hostess came to us at the bar across the way to let us know our table was ready. Our waitress was pretty attentive. The only draw back on service was that it took them awhile to bring us some silverware. We ordered and as we were waiting we hit the chip and salsa bar. There was no chips but crumbs. We had to wait for that. The salsa bar was pretty messy. After going up a second time you would hope they cleaned it up. No, it was still messy. The salsa was pretty good. A good selection to choose from from very mild to hot. Well, what they think is hot lol. More like spicy ketchup. The menu was ok. Very pricy for the types of selections to choose from. I just ordered from the appetizers because it just seemed tastier. I ordered the Cholula Boneless Wings. They were pretty good. The flavor was cholula blended with butter. It was a star. The spicy chicken flour taquito thing they had, I dont know the name but was made with flour and looked more like an egg roll. It was flavorless. Im dipping salsa and cholula on it to get some sort of flavor. The other thing i couldnt figure out is that its owned by station casinos, why is beer pricier in the restaurant when the bar next the it was cheaper. It made no sense and we would have to walk out to save a buck. Hopefully fix some things and revamp the menu. I dont know if i would go back unless I hear some positives. Till next time...Lets Eat!!"
0,"If you like BUGS in your food, then this is your place to go!nnNo, seriously. I used to be a devoted Griddle fan.. This was my goto for a breakfast spot..  Until I had two NASTY accidents here within a week of each other! nnI had visited this place with my sister. She ordered a chicken salad sandwich of some sorts. When her order came, she lifted a slice of the bread to add salt and pepper, and what do you know, a BUG was crawling in her sandwich. We immediately sent it back, and noticed a few diners looked a little turned off from their food.. So my sister agreed to just order the same thing. They made her a new one, which came out suspiciously fast, for making a new sandwich?nnNow for the second round. I decided to go here again later on in the week on my lunch hour with a coworker. I ordered my usual egg white omelette with potatoes. As I am slicing my potatoes, there is very CLEARLY a DEAD FRIED FLY IN MY POTATOES. nnThis place is disgusting. I will not be back. Sorry, Griddle, but take better care of your sanitation. NASTY."
0,"There has to be better Italian food in Pittsburgh  I dont know why anyone would come here.nnI had an overnight field trip with my students to Pittsburgh  the tour company took us here for a murder mystery dinner show.  They had us sectioned off which was great for privacy  also since the students were loud.nnTheir service is a hot mess!!!!  They only had  waiters serving our  person group  it was not organized at all.  Just getting our drinks out was confusing.  The waiters just came out with any drink  then asked  anyone order this??  This is why my table sat drinkless, breadless,  saladless for the longest time.nnFor our dinner, we were given a salad, entree,  tiramisu.  The salad was definitely straight out of the bag  doused with some cheap dressing.  It didnt taste fresh at all.  There was a list of  or so entrees we could choose from.  They came out quite haphazardly.  I unfortunately ordered the fettuccine alfredo  worst ever.  I could make better alfredo using the sauce from a supermarket jar.  I tried to douse it with pepper  cheese but alas it did nothing to help it.  Some of the others said the chicken parm was alright but some said theirs was undercooked.  The tiramisu also was gross.  It definitely was made  cut awhile ago  just kept cold in their fridge.nnThe redeeming parts of this dinner was the decor  old fashioned coin operated games AND the mystery show.  Ive never been to one  was really excited.  They started after we ate our entrees  intermissioned during dessert.  The actors were super funny  interactive  my students loved them which of course makes me happy.  Seriously though, their food is so bad."
0,"So you are in Lost Wages and want to go clubbing because that is what all the hot girls or guys are doing... and who hasnt heard of Rain at least once? Well you get there and find that there is a line even if you are on the guest list... WTH I guess some promoters are better than others, at least we didnt have to pay anything special to get in...nnSo this place is not very much fun unless you have a table or so it seems. If you dont have a table, you are crushed into a super tight sausage fest space! GRrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr... drinks are pricy, its hot inside and out and then they start running flames through the ceiling noticeably heating the room up even further with each burst... Not sooo much fun I must say.nnPRO TIP You can leave items at the front desk for pick up later at no charge! nnThe good thing about when I was here is that DJ Jazzy Jeff was spinning. Its not every day that you get to listen to a legend. However the rest of the experience was subpar nnI would much more highly suggest the other clubs within the Palms Casino over this one. Granted there were a couple of random cute girls here, but several were admittedly working girls and I didnt want any part of that. I doubt you would either..."
0,"I went in on a whim because the line for Subway was so long and the prices looked so good. I ordered a hamburger with potato wedges and a drink. Everything was less than  with tax, fantastic!nnThat said, when I got my food, I was less than impressed. The potato wedges were okay, not really my style, I prefer fries, and if there are wedges, I prefer smaller ones  these were giant  but they were pretty decent for what they were.nnThe burger though, was GROSS. The patty was clearly a frozen patty that was cooked at some point  Im  sure it wasnt right before I ate it though because it tasted and had the consistency of something sitting under a heat warmer forever.nnThe staff was polite, but I will probably not be back to give it a second chance  even at these prices. Id rather pay a little more and get real food."
0,"So heres the thing... we bought a house in Dormont and it was so nice to discover a larger hardware store that wasnt a big box name. Plus, its only a mile from my place, perfect!nnSo I head here for a quick pickup for some threeway switches ordered by the handyman who was working on my electric at home. I had no clue what I was looking for and had saved a note on my phone. nnI walk in and find the first person I see. A woman who was in a Rolliers apron, standing by a cash register reading the PostGazette. I asked her politely if she worked there. She slowly responded yeah hardly looking up. I read off what I needed from my phone and again, barely looking up, pointed to the back and said lighting, in the back.nnI stood there for a second and realized she was blatantly blowing me off. Customer service is so important... and I would expect a locally owned hardware store to have excellent customer service. Why? I guess because the big box stores are cheaper and maybe more accessible. But compared to the excellent service I experienced at Home Depot every time Ive been in, this was a real letdown. nnI did find a nicer employee who showed me exactly what I needed in the back, but still. I wont say Ill never go in again, but it definitely left a sour taste in my mouth."
0,"Decided to stop in and try Beantown on a Friday night. Its a casual sports bar. When we walked in, the hostess was gone and we didnt know if it was seat yourself or not. She eventually showed up and led us to our table. The server was polite but didnt know the beer menu that well wasnt sure if they had PBR a pretty common beverage dont ya think? The one good thing about the place is the food wasnt half bad, I built my own calzone which starts out at  dollars and . for each topping, a bit pricey for a plate of dough. At least it came out hot and it wasnt bad.nnThis place gets two stars because of the bad service. It wasnt crowded for a Friday! and our server just disappeared after our food came out. Saw her texting and just wasting time with other servers. It took about  minutes to get our check. When we eventually left, I spotted the hostess on the patio talking to a guy and not doing her job. Seems like the place needs better management. Wont be going back."
0,Great service. Really good flatbread. Can have as appetizer or dinner. We had grilled chicken. For a sports bar what it was good. Filled with locals. Most seemed t know wait staff who were all very friendly  stars for Rickards Red beer. Cesar salad was also quite tasty. Wasnt happy with music at first but after  beers I was liking it a lotFun time.
0,"Dont waste your time here. This place is dirty and the service is horrible!!!! We came to eat, but because of the bad service we waited  min and no one took our order we had a drink and left. The girls seem confused and upset. Husbands beer was flat. Not much else to say other than people around us complained constantly about service and food and one couple sent their food back."
0,"So this may in fact be the worst Chipotle in existence. Let me explain.nnEvery time I show up craving a burrito bowl, theres a huge line to the door. Each person in line is wondering why theyre there. You can tell. Theyre wondering why they put up with the low quality, the terrible service, the indifferent management, the unacceptable price of guacamole, the attitudes of the guy asking you what you want  or more often, telling you to hold on. The only time Ive come here and not had to wait in line, this troll still told me I had to wait because they were making an order for a  family not in attendance.nnIve checked in to this place a few times, and Ive been to the Chipotle by Fashion Square a few thousand. For some reason, that place is bomb and this place sucks. At this location, you have to stand in line among dinein patrons and witness the slop that youre about to ingest and the looks of disappointment on their faces after each unfulfilling bite.nnIf youve already decided to eat at Chipotle, youve probably had Chipotle before. If youre like me, you go to get a burrito bowl with no rice because youre a Slow Carb or  Hour Body fanatic. You know that you can get what you need not necessarily what you want. If you want a delicious authentic Mexican meal, go across the street to Julios. If you want to hate yourself and write a whiny Yelp review about it, come here."
0,"Stay away from this place. This place is trash. The dentist doesnt know what she is doing at all. It seem like she is just graduated and has no experiences whatsoever. I had such a bad experience with this place from the beggining to the finish. I just had my root carnal a month ago. I was in so much pain during the whole process. It took  hours to finish the whole thing. I knew my teeth was that bad and it was just a root carnal. One day after the process, I was in so much pain that I had to take pain releive pill. I couldnt chew or even drink cold water. A few days later, my tooth had a small hole. So I had to go back to and get it fixed. I have never had this bad experience with a dentist like this before. I shouldve have stayed with my old dentist who has a lot more experiences. More than that the dentist is a bitch. She just wants your money. This place is hell. Stay away from it."
0,"A group of us came here to celebrate a friends promotion. We came in early and sat at the bar as we waited for the rest of the party. Drink prices are standard for a Strip location. As a Mexican restaurant they are known for their margaritas and have a menu that highlight their various concoctions. I had wanted to try a couple of them, but they did not have certain components to make them. I went with a micholada and it was good. They didnt have clamato, so they just used bloody mary mix instead. They offered us chips and salsa after our second drink. The seasoning on those warm chips makes for crack.nnOnce we were seated, it took some time for us to get service.  minutes pass and no one showed up.  minutes goes by and still no one. We were told the server didnt know he had the table. Honest mistake. Eventually, our server did come. We had some issues with what was in stock. I had wanted  different kinds of whiskey, but they didnt have either. nnFood wise The appetizers were delicious. We got the ceviche, a queso fundido, chicken tacos, and the guacamole. The fish was tender and seasoned well. The acidic component mellowed out with the use of cucumbers. The queso was okay. The chorizo didnt give as much of a kick as I was hoping. The fact that they serve it in a iron skillet allows the cheese to crisp on the bottom. Scraping up all of it and eating it is half the joy. I didnt try the tacoes, but the others seemed to enjoy it. The guacamole was probably my favorite. The put pomegranate seeds on top. It gave it a touch of tart and sweetness that was the most unique item on the menu. As for entrees, nothing was spectacular. The sweet corn enchiladas were a decent vegetarian option, but lacked a countering flavor, so it was just sweet. The burger was cooked perfectly and was juicy. I just wouldnt come to a Mexican restaurant and think burger. My friend enjoyed his chicken torta. I stole a bite of the chicken enchiladas and werent impressed.nnOne of our party members paid before they left and it took some time to get our waiter to come back. We had still wanted to order some more drinks, but by the time he came back we were ready to leave. I know they are still new and will eventually work out the kinks."
0,"No matter how much they renovate it this place is utterly very disgutsting. I felt bad that my mom had to go there because she doesnt have insurance. The only reason she got a spot in the back was because she came in on a stretcher! So many people were waiting around. Homeless no offense at alll and all. Its soo crowded with the sick til it just seems unsanitary. Plus, the nurses are very rude and defensive."
0,"Ive been interested in staying at the Excalibur, with their Medieval feel, for years.  Although unplanned, I was excited recently to get a truckload going to Vegas and flew in the wife for a  day whirlwind occasion.  Priceline got us a . room which was amazing until Excalibur hit us with their . resort fee.  It wasnt the money as much as the trickery involved.   over an agreed upon and contracted price  after the fact  hello.  These fees are for the extras such as a swimming pool that closes at pm, Internet and cell phone signals which didnt work, and a telephone and tv in your own room.  Even roach motels have all that.  When I explained I didnt need incidentals, they insisted on putting a hold on my credit card just in case.  Just in case means they earn interest on your money the following week before giving it back.  Their entrances are filled with persistent sales leaches who they encourage by providing them with the stations from which to badger you.  No knights or ladies with flowered halos to greet you like in Hawaii.  While navigating this maze of blue blazered pests, youre asked by a slew of them if you would like to see a free show tonight, eat cheap and get a free nights stay..........only the shows arent really free and they arent tonight but youll find that out  minutes into the scam.  If you pay  towards your NEXT VISIT......hey Excalibur, I didnt come here to revisit Timeshare tactics nor tell the same girl  times to get out my face.  If shes working your door then she needs to be parking my car or toting my bags.  I came here to be Knighted and left a Jester.  Our first room had a view of a industrial rooftop air conditioners. Not below us but  directly outside our window.  After complaining, we received an older room on the th floor but on  separate occasions had to ride back down the elevator, waltz across the casino and wait in line in the lobby to get our magnetic room keys reset.  Unplanned  minute trips sucks at AM.  While watching a football game in the casino bar we noticed signs announcing a  special for a beer and dog.......its been my experience that Vegas casinos offer free drinks when you gamble but evidently the Excalibur wasnt told of this tradition so I found myself paying for oz drafts while feeding their bar slots.  At the very least, you would expect that the hotdogs would be quality......a brat?sausage? footlong?  WRONG.  How about small childs Oscar Meyer weenie in a cold bun......no mustard, chili, cheese, saurkraut, nada.......Truckstops have better.  My expectation were dashed so we chose to gamble elsewhere.  Thank God we didnt plan an entire week around it.  It reminded me of some of the seedier turn and burn bars on Bourbon St.  Of all the cool clubs my hometown of New Orleans has to offer, certain clubs have a policy of discourage locals in order to prey on unsuspecting and ignorant tourist. Its a grab policy steeped in this will probably be their only visit here so lets rape em.   At least New Orleans has the Lucky Dog.  The Excalibur couldnt even get the hotdog right.......and to think I was expecting to gnaw on the meaty leg bone of some large mammal."
0,"The service is better but the food is ok, Does not hold a candle to Petes eSan Sab. I have eaten there every week since to new owners took over, ever week the food loses something.

Unfortantuely it they changed the recipes and the food is just avg, have not ventured back in Feb. nnI have not want to the buffet since no owners"
0,"Went here friday night for dinner with hubby. We had not been here for a few years and we were excited to try it again. We wanted to love it... But found everything to be just ok... Kinda disappointing. Service was slow, even though it was not that busy our first clue we nProbably picked the wrong place to eat. The restaurant was very warm... I am always  old even in las vega summers but the first thing I asked the waitress aw to please have the ac turned down as I was sticking to my shirt after only a few minutes in my booth. She agreed that it was warm,but thought it was because she was working hard. It never cooled off much after our initial discussion. Oh well... Food was ok... Not great and not bad enough to send back. Grilled shrimp salad was soggy, over dressed  forgot to ask for dressing on the side, soup was hot, weird oily creaminess. I did not like the leftover coating in my mouth so hubby ate this. Garlic bread was over greasy... Really it was a white pizza, not garlic bread like I thought. Bar far, the worst part of the meal was a salad that we took home for our daughter. We ordered the chopped sAlad to go. We did not bother to. Heck it before we left the restaurant would never have occurred to me!. When she opened the sAlad, she thought we were playing a joke on her. There were  small cubes of chicken, small pieces of copped tomAto, a sprinkle of chopped black olives and about  cups of shredded lettuce!  We could not find anything else in this sAlad... She deconstructed everything, cut up her own tomAto, shredded some cheese, removed more than half of the shredded lettuce and had her dinner. Still An anemic salad, but when its late Nd youRe hungry, what are you going to do? Horrible... There is no way they would have served this salad in the restaurant. I feel ripped off! I would have called to complain, but then they would probably offer to replace or give a coupon. No thanks, I have no desire to go back... Even for free meal!"
0,I went because of the reviews.   I left to save my brain cells.  As soon as I walked in the door I got a headache from the heavy oder of chemicals.   I have no idea how people can stand it.  I have never smelled a salon that toxic in my life!
0,"This is to report a very negative experience we had tonight at fuel pizza.  I normally dont write reviews, but was pretty upset with my experience there this evening and Im still hungry, so I thought I would share.  n called in to order two pizzas for delivery.  They were busy and said it would be an hour.n hour and  minutes laterno pizza, called again, they said pizza was en route.n minutes later we live about  minutes away no pizza, called again.  Person put the manager on phone, who said it was put in as a pickup.  Tried to tell him that we were leaving my friends house and to change the address to our home address...but he interrupted me and said that it would get out when they could...and hung up on me.nSince we live close and they had my credit card , I decided to go and speak to the manager about this.  I politely expressed my displeasure with him hanging up on me and explained to him that someone there wasnt telling me the truth.  He looked at me and asked what I wanted him to do about it.  There was no apology at any time during our interaction, which really bothered me.    He made me feel like he couldnt care less that we didnt get our pizzas.  So I told him to cancel the order and left.   I wasnt rude to him, but wanted him to know that I wasnt happy with the way things were handled.   As the manager, he should have been more compassionate to the customer that had been waiting for two hours for a pizza. Thats it, feel better now.  Wont be going to Fuel on principle, which is sad because we have been good customers for several years."
0,"Dont expect anything remotely good from this place. Theyre the most absolutely disgusting, dry, overlooked crappy patties EVER made!  Its like eating sand, sawdust and meal worms all rolled into one. This is the most sorry pathetic, atrocious excuse for what was written on the menu as a burger.  Voted best burger, MY ASS! That review was from  years ago! Definitely dont waste your time or money!!  Youll find something better to eat, I promise."
0,I had no idea this place existed. Decent lunch hour prices as well as happy hour. Make sure that when you say you want something spicy to emphasize that you really want it spicy. There version of extra spicy was pretty weak.
0,"THE Hotel at Mandalay Bay is just ok. For a high end suites only hotel this place is ok at best. First lets talk about the suites. The suite was ok compared to the Signature MGM. THE Hotel did not have a full kitchen, we couldnt even put our bottle waters in the mini fridge because they would charge us  for just sticking in own water bottles in their mini fridge. The TVs are out dated, my grandma has a better tv then what they had. The bathroom was nice separate tub and shower, two sinks, and even a scale so I can see how much weight I gained after eating at the buffets. The bathroom was the only thing that is worth praising. You can also hear the cars on the freeway from the room and we were on the th floor! The air conditioner would blow my face every time it went off when I was sleeping. Freaking blizzard every  mins. The check out was a bit of a joke as well. We wanted to pay cash but couldnt because their computer system was down. Hopefully they lost all the info so they cant charge my card. This place is just ok I wouldnt stay here again only if it was for free or when I have kids so they can play and pee in the pool.   The pool at the hotel was nice but too many people in my opinion and the music blaring was not pleasant when youre just trying to relax. There is free self parking.  Also their wireless internet is garbage. Try the Signature at the MGM before you come here."
0,"I think this should be more like . stars. I got a pack of tamales. They were more expensive than I wouldve guessed I sort of had to, considering they werent priced. First I open the package and lowandbehold this bag of six tamales, in fact, contains only five! The filling is fine, but the masa blows. It is dry and gritty.

0,"Not worth the price. I had high expectations for this hotels amenities and service. The Wynn is definitely not the Ritz or Nordstroms of the Las Vegas Strip at least not for the masses  perhaps they treat their high rollers well. nnOur experience started at checkin. We attempted to checkin at pm and were told that there were not any rooms available yet with two double beds. We were offered rooms with king beds but since this was my good friends bachelorette party weekend, we needed the double beds. We finally were able to checkin at pm. The desk explained that the rooms were not available because they allow guests to pay for a  day and stay until pm. We were not offered any comps or upgrades for our inconvenience. The room itself was nice but not worth their night charge. We also experienced attitude from the bell desk where we were forced to check our bags until our room was ready. Also, the hotel decor itself was very reminiscent of Bellagio, just a bit newer. Nothing special.nnWe did eat at Corsa Cucina and that was fine  pricey but decent service and food. Tryst was a great experience that I would recommend to any faithful clubgoer. But, the line was already at least an hour long when we arrived at  but since we were a bachelorette party they let us ahead of the line. Of course the club itself was empty when we arrived  not sure why it took them so long to let people inside."

0,"Meh. This had pluses and minuses. Plus  the beer menu was fantastic. Minus  they poured my Dogfishhead  minute IPA expensive, tasty into a hot glass. So, nasty warm expensive beer. Thanks, new bartenders! I will say they gave me a new, cold glass to pour it into, which helped. As soon as I started telling the server what happened, she finished my sentence  guess that happens a lot. But really, what bartender worth their salt does that? Side note, happy hour is only till  instead of  like most places. So when youre off around , like most of us, then head over, you have maybe half an hour. Which is lame. Next, the food. Ordered the pretzels, which, per the menu, are made from the pizza dough. They are not, however. They are made from wheat flour. Which is fine, but for the fact that it was not indicated. So, surprise! Doughy, crunchy, brown, extremely bland pretzels. I could smell garlic, but surely could not taste it. Meh!!!! I decided at that point not to order any food  I was unimpressed. However my husband texted and asked if I could bring him a salad. So I braved it. No bueno. They have  sizesprices of salads, so I thought the expensive one would be large. Having learned from the pretzel escapade, however, I specifically asked whether the large would be enough for two, and was given an emphatic YES! Its more than enough! So I did a build your own salad. Plus  You can create your own salad as desired! Minus Its TINY! And every topping is individual. Which would be ok if it were slathered with toppings, but its not. Got mushrooms  for   and there were quite literally, I counted six slices of mushroom. Which Im almost sure is not even a whole mushroom. For !!! Also ordered bleu cheese crumbles, at a whopping ., and had  no joke  two tiny balls of bleu cheese. All told the salad cost  !!! and was subpar. All on all, I was angry with myself for stopping here. The bartenders didnt know what they were doing, the food blew, and it was packed with screaming children. I will note, however, in addition to the excellent beer menu, we had a great server. Thats why they got the second star."
0,First off dont come here alone. Portions are for  or more and the menu doesnt offer more than one item and rice so it would be too much for one person to order  items. I ordered the Orange chicken because its a dish that is hard to screw up. Well despite the place being fairly empty and several staff on hand it seemed an eternity before any one took my order. Once my food arrived I dug in only to find the chicken flavorless with barely a hint of orange. It tasted more like sweet and sour sauce of the grocery store variety. I ate  the plate a decided I could do better at home with a packet of spicy seafood ramen. In the time it has taken for the wait staff to notice that I had given up on their tasteless dish to the time I received the cheque has been an eternity. I will never eat here again and I recommend that you dont waste you time or money. There is a plaque at the front door that claims best of Phoenix... I doubt they would win that award today.
0,"I dont know where to start with this place. When we got there, the place looked really unorganized and dirty with crumbs on the seats where we sat. Next the waitress seemed like she didnt want to be working there and was completely rude! I then got my salad that looked old with watered down ranch dressing. We were waiting for a long time to get our entrees and once we got them it was cold and was not tasty at all!! nnI will never be coming back here again the service and the food was horrible!!! If I were you I wouldnt waste my time and money coming here."
0,"The food os pretty good Italian fare but the portion sizes are small and the prices are HIGH! I really wish I could recommend the place, but you need to take out a loan to eat there, especially for dinner."
0,"When I see a restaurant with a  star rating on Yelp, I expect the food to be good. The food at Albertos was mediocre at best. To make matters worse, my wife found a hair on her plate. Eat here at your own risk."
0,"The Food Network sign fooled me too. nn for  egg rolls.  the small sized bowl of pho. Am I at a Vietnamese place? nnThe owner had a wry sense of humor, as evidenced by the signs on the wall. I appreciate her trying to joke around with us. That didnt make the pho taste any better. I couldnt smell any of the spices in the pho. It tasted like canned beef broth with meat and noodles. It wasnt mediocre pho it was outright bland, tasteless pho. nnWe were also overcharged by . The owner said she made a mistake and made some joke about being the only Asian to ever fail math. It seemed a little suspicious to me that she was able to write the correct sum of our charges, but when she added the  tax, it somehow became a  tax. Ill give her the benefit of doubt, but Id scrutinize my receipt if I were you.nnWont be returning."
0,I was at the Luxor last November with some friends.nnWhen we got to our rooms  one of the guys in our room received a room that hadnt been cleaned  and still had garbage from its previous occupants.  Good thing the guy staying in that room was so drunk he didnt care.  nnThe exterior design of the hotel is very impressive and speaks for itself.nnIf you are in the pyramid  you will find that the pyramid design comes at a high price  you have to do an insane amount of walking.  I got a room that was about as far as possible from the elevator  meaning that going to my room meant walking half of the perimeter of the pyramid at the fifteenth floor.  While you might need calculus to figure out exactly how long the walk was  I can tell you that going from the casino to my room and back to change shirts was at least a fifteen minute ordeal !?!?!nnConstruction was going on all over the hotel  and I heard some of it at night.  nnThe rooms and carpeting in the hallway look like theyve been partied inon every night since this hotel opened  without ANYTHING being replaced.  Forget about taking your wifegirlfriend here  Im not sure Id be that enthusiastic about taking a hooker back to the room I had.nnBetween the location and room quality  unless the room was free or almost free  I probably wouldnt stay here again.

0,"I may be a foodie, but when it come to Ramsay, this is as far as I go.  I should clarify that this is how far down Ill go on my standards knowing how he really is with his food.  Ive tried his beef wellington and even after years, I still know the texture and taste of that delicious goodness along with his sticky toffee pudding and ice cream that blows Ben  Jerry or Haagen Dazs out of the water at his other restaurant.  I was sure disappointed about this place.  My family and I each had something different the soba noodle dish, burger, and chicken burger along with the toffee pudding push pop.  The soba noodle had nothing too special about it except for the chicken, the burger my brother had was bland, and the chicken burger the waitress so absolutely gloated about with interesting flavors, was a huge disappointment.  After that one bite of the chicken burger from her description, I was bummed and didnt even finish it.  The truffle fries was nothing too special either.  Honestly, I would have preferred McDonalds french fries over this!!!  I think the only thing I actually enjoyed was the sauce they normally have on their wings, but for my fries.  You know the restaurant is bad when you like the sauce of all things they have to offer.  nnThis place didnt justify the  minutes wait along with mediocre service.  I think I was the only person wanting to watch hockey in that place since my visit was during the Stanley Cups just shows how disinterested I was in the food and of all the TV screens on, they couldnt do it.  The manager exclaimed, Who watches hockey out here? and proceeds to make a joke about the Cubs.  Hmmm, lets just say that burning flame display in the front was a great indication of my mood for me that night.  This is another concept of Food Network chefs Ill scratch out from ever coming in along with Border Grill at Mandalay Bay.   nnBottom line Save your money and your time from this place and invest it for his more upscale restaurants."
0,"I gave away our card with  stamps at the end of the meal.  THATS how sure our group was that none of us would ever return.  nnThis isnt sushi in the Japanese sense.  These are crazy freakin rollsinventions that contain some raw fish in, on or around them.  Calling this Japanese is very misleading.  The typical roll on the menu sounds like thisnnTastes and smells like your bitchy exmother in laws st semester college sophomore roommate who did the whole lacrosse team on a dare and got Hepatitis C roll  Baked inside out roll stuffed with eel, cream cheese, bbq sauce, avocado, super super super white tuna, chopped yellowtail and spicy tuna, shishito peppers, scallop, garlic and salmon on top with orgasm, yum yum, and fuck me in the ass sauce on the side.nnAs you can see, they used the whole I Love Sushi concept and took it way over the top.  This could be a potentially fun dinner as many Yelp reviews can attest trying all the insanity but there were enough misses to warrant my negativity.  It wasnt fun, but it sure was funny.  nn Sushi rice was off.  Slimy?  Low quality?  I dont know for sure since there was a lot of sauce.  I see a lot of reviews raving about sashimi though.n  nSpeaking of sauce...whats up with drenching sauce all over nigiri?  Several pieces of nigiri came with sauce on top as a default.  We actually had to request it without.  Freshness of the fish was ok.  None of us died afterwards.  nnPretty sure that was shrimp cocktail drenched in a soy sauce base and topped with scallion advertised as amaebi. nn order of green tea was not green but it might have been due to the lipstick contamination on the side of the cup.  The liquid was a very, very light brown.  The server claimed it was green tea despite my protest.  Magically, the next cup of tea was suddenly very green.  So thats where Dirk Arthur has been performing all this time!!nn I didnt know uni came in so many colors.  The most suspect pieces were left on the plate.  The server didnt even question it.  She just took them away like she knew.nn My native Japanese dinnermates found the tamago presentation to be hilarious.  A tamago house!nnAt least the unagi was good.  Congratulations on well cooked eel!  Have a good life."
0,"I admit it. Im a foodie and I have high standards. I eat out a lot in New York. Id heard good things about the NYC Mesa Grill, so I figured this place would at least have some edible food. Error on my part.nnThe food bumps this review down to one star. The waitstaff could not have been nicer, which I why Im bumping it back up to two. But honestly, dont you usually go to a place like this for the food?nnThere are three sauces an offwhite one, an orange one and a dark brown one. Add some combination of these three to a meat or veggie substance and youve got your entire menu. Creative, it aint. Our party of eight tried just about everything.nnNot much flavor to the sauces or the dishes in general. Boring is the word that comes to mind. What kills me is that our waiter spent about half his time telling us dont worry, nothing on the menu is spicy! He might as well have said dont worry, nothing on the menu is flavorful! I have no problem with mild food, but its a little weird at a southwestern themed restaurant.nnI can recommend the cactus pear cocktail though. That was tasty, and maybe after a few of them you wont notice the lack of flavor in the food."
0,"I was attracted to this place because of the large selection of well priced clothes however was horribly disappointed with the way I was treated upon walking into the store. I needed jeans so I approached a lady behind the counter later identified as Justina and began the sentence hi, Im looking for jeans but... And Im rudely interrupted with an eye roll and a pointing finger the jeans are right there. Right in front of you. Do you see them? nnEXCUSE ME!!! Beyond rude. I was just going to ask if you had any brands that run long because Im  and didnt want to spend all night trying on jeans. nnI wont be returning."
0,"This place is a big generic yawn.nnWhat we have here is your basic river town restaurant for business travelers and old people. Theres cheesy fauxswank decor, overpriced steaks, and sliders god, when is this trend going to blow over here?.nnBread service was some undistinguished sourdough with cheap tasting olive oil and balsamic vinegar straight out of Restaurant Depot vats.nnHad a gnocchi dish that was overpowered by the flavor of stale garlic and unevenly cooked root vegetables. nnThe cioppino featured lessthanfresh seafood and about a quarter cup of sand. Guess the chef hasnt heard of this thing called a fine mesh sieve.nnBottom line this place lacks ambition, creativity and finish."
0,"I love Tom Colicchio, really, I do. It pains me to say that my experience at his MGMnrestaurant was less than stellar. If this had been Restaurant Wars, I dont know if wed see Tom advance to the next round...nnWhen we approached the hostess desk, four hostessesservers were present and not one greeted us until about three minutes had passed. nnI had the lobster bisque and found it overwhelmingly over seasoned with cinnamon. It tasted more like cake batter than bisque. nnNext, I had the arugula salad with lemon vinaigrette. They actually refused to add tomatoes to it! For the first time in my life I had to send food back to the kitchen. The taste of lemon was so intense, I felt like I was biting directly into one with each bite. I couldnt muster the courage to finish the dish. nnThe risotto that we had as a side had a taste that reminded me Betty Crocker Instant scalloped potatoes. It was sticky and undercooked. nnI must say, the service was wonderful very attentive and friendly. Other dishes that we got scallops, Wagyu tartare, and hangar steak were delicious. nnOverall, a disappointment. I still lovenTom though."
0,"Overall very disappointing experience.   Room not as nice as rest of hotel appeared, though the bed and pillows were very comfy.   Towels were pretty thin and yucky.   Coffee in the room was TERRIBLE.   We purchased a inout parking pass for  which was supposed to be good for whole stay, but ended up only working one time, and when we went to leave the garage after checking out, the machine declined our card and we had no choice but to pay  to be allowed to exit!   I called the desk for assistance and to get a refund on the  pass, but the woman who had such a thick accent I couldnt understand most of what she said, stated that we would need to either fax or scan and email a copy of the  receipt we had to pay upon leaving and only then could she give a refund!  SERIOUSLY?   Who would make something like that up, and its not like its hundreds of dollars, its  bucks.    She tried to give me the email to send it to, but I couldnt understand her, so I gave up.    She said I could call back later to get the address if necessary, but honestly it just seems like more hassle than its worth at this point.   VERY DISAPPOINTED in the staffs ability to be helpful at this hotel.    It is nicely located for the sporting venues, Market Square, and not far to Southside where we went to see a movie.  Also the garage is very conveniently located, but just dont buy the pass unless you want to be let down!"
0,"Weve had this venerable began operation in BBQ Joint on our NC Barbecue Bucket List for more than a few years now.  Last Tuesday we paid them a visit, and it was much less than wed hoped for, much less in almost every respect. There is little here that represents the more traditional NC barbecue restaurant, which doesnt mean it has to be bad, but here it did mean that..nnThe building is beyond well worn, the parking area seems a workinprogress, hard to tell where the roadside ends and the parking begins. The inside is dark almost brooding, and not a great deal of light spreads out from the small, faux oil lamp fixtures.nnWe were seated promptly in the almost empty dining area, drink orders secured, and our food choices followed quickly. We went with  BBQ Chicken dark meat with Brunswick Stew and Baked Beans ., and a Small BBQ Pork plate with FFs  Slaw also .. The meals did not come with HPs but rather with thick slices of Texas Toast  the first of a number of things not traditional in NC BBQ restaurants. You can buy an order of HPs for . if youd like, we didnt.nnThe food was out of the kitchen rather quickly, and that was perhaps the highlight of the ensuing meal. The BBQ Chicken was simply awful  it was overcooked, dry  tasteless sans the sauce, the skin tough and leathery  the whole mess smothered in a thick sweet, red barbecue sauce that quickly became cloying. nnThe Brunswick Stew was pretty good though very different in texture and content from that normally served in this area. The stew here is thicker and contains no lima beans, and according to UNC TV food guru Bob Garner, it probably contains stale bread, which thickens the end product. The Baked Beans also were nice, with some pieces of meat in it.nnThe pork is minced, much like Stameys in Greensboro, but the pork here is not cooked over hard wood coals, so there is no smokiness to it, at all. The sauce is a thick red sauce, rarely found in this area, usually found farther west. I like  this style sauce on occasion, but not this sauce, and not on this meat.nnThe service was very good, until it came time to pay the check. We waited over  minutes at the register while several employees milled around, apparently not authorized to operate the register. Finally, an unpleasant and rude man the owner or manager, I guess came out of the back, took my money without a Im sorry, or a thank you. nnWell, Ive a thought on the thanks part  no thanks for this food, this restaurant, and this arse at the register."
0,"I went to Tex Tubbs with a larger sized group  about   for a small birthday celebration a little while back. Despite my review of two stars, let me start off by saying I think I was there on a bad day for service and they deserve a second chance. Our meal was an assortment of errors and mistakes, but despite that the food was good and portions were good. I think on a different night, wed see something different.nnI had the tamale special, which was tasty. However, I had ordered chicken and not pork. Not cool, but no big thing for me. The birthday girls drink order went in and disappeared into a void. The time for food to come out of the kitchen was inordinately long. Personally, I thought our waitress was great and totally on top of things and the kitchen was just lost in the sauce that evening. nnThere were other errors, but most of them were not major...just a cluster of minors. The food was still good and Ill be back for a second visit. Hopefully theyll be better sorted by then."

0,"As I sit at the front counter enjoying my view of the mens room and sipping my fantastically overpriced glass of Room temperature red wine, using the Tropic of Capricorn for the room temperature standard I woefully bat my eyes at multiple waitrons hoping one will take pity and  humor me by taking my order. Now granted Im shoved into a corner like Baby would have never accepted but Im desperately hungry and pickings are slim in terminal C. Thinking  min is plenty of time to order a burger and choke it down before I fly away was a pipe dream of gargantuan proportions. My up charged  Kobe burger alas was boxed for cold consumption aloft to the chagrin of my seat mates. But they wouldnt box my million dollar hot grape juice to complete the awesome take away adventure."
0,Customer service is non existent! We were there to try their smoothies and salads which judging by their prices we were going to spend some dough I have to agree they are overpriced.  The person in front of us had an inactive loyalty card? Let me reiterate this was NOT a payment card so there really was no emergency. We waited and waited and waited and not ONE of the many workers many who were just standing there watching had the foresight to just take our order and then have us pay when they were done dealing with the travesty of an INACTIVE LOYALTY CARD!!!! Ahhhh!!!! ..... We finally decided to just walk out.
0,"We were actually headed to Pamelas and noticed this diner across the street. We decided to give it a try since we like trying new places. I left wishing we had gone to Pamelas instead! The restaurant itself is kind of weird inside. Very bare, odd tableschairs that look like they were from the s...it didnt look like an established restaurant...reminded me of a popup or temp place. Anyway, there werent many people there...the restaurant was probably only  full and it took more than a half hour to get our meals...and we didnt order anything more than standard breakfast fare...eggs, potatoes, pancakes...things that dont have a lot of prep. After waiting all that time they also forgot my side of sausage that was part of the eggs combo meal I ordered. nnThe food was average and didnt make up for all the other areas this place lacked.nnOur waitress was nice, but there was a busboy who was really loud at clearing tables. Hed toss the ceramic plates and mugs in his bussing tub carelessly and he yelled across the restaurant to his coworkers...all of which were really distracting since the place was otherwise very quiet.nnIf youre in Millvale looking for a place to eat, just go to Pamelas across the street!"
0,"Long wait, despite having only a few people dining. Horrid tasting food. Waitress had all the charisma of a robotelemarketer. IMO this was overpriced garbage. This place makes me wish I had gone somewhere else."
0,"I ate here twice.  The first time, I had a steak dinner, and found they forgot to season the meat, forgot to season the spinach, forgot to bring me any bread I get just a little and look forward to it, and FORGOT I WAS THERE.nnTwo days later,  people for breakfast, they were OK, but JUST OK."
0,Ok well my family and I got kicked out of the restaurant and we were very embarrassed. Evidently my  yr old was playing with the waiters too much and laughing too loud. Wtf?

I will also tell my friends this.place isnt family oriented its snobby and too rich for a small cute laughing baby. You suck chef Ramsey!!!!
0,"If someone told me I was going to try a  burger that Alan Richman of GQ Magazine said was the best burger I ate this year, I would be pretty damn excited. And I was, until I ate it. How can a burger that costs  that is located in a multiaward winning restaurant suck? Bradley Ogdens restaurant showed me how.nnLocated in Caesars Palace, Bradley Ogdens is positioned along a small row of restaurants within the casino. The exterior of the space is fairly unassuming and subdued, as is the duecor within. I didnt get to venture too far into the actual restaurant, as our burger is only served in their lounge area. Apparently a  isnt good enough for the regular menu, although Im sure for the price they would serve it to you if requested.nnBeing that this is a blend of house ground steak according to the menu, it had to be ordered medium rare to sample what would hopefully be tremendous flavor. After what I think was far too long of a wait for a random week night when it wasnt that busy, our food arrived. The presentation was great as you can see in the picture, but the situation quickly deteriorated from there. Because the meat is supposedly so amazing according to the chef, the burger is served with absolutely no toppings, just a bun. You are offered ketchup, spicy mustard and a decent aioli, along with a salad and fries, but that is all. Upon biting into my burger I came across the largest disappointment of the night though an overcooked burger! You would think that at  they would get my medium rare order correct? No such luck. This really pissed me off, and Burger Boy wasnt that thrilled either. The meat had not as much flavor as expected for such a blend of meats, maybe because it was cooked too much, I dont know. The bun was ok, toasted pretty well, maybe a bit dry too. But together they just didnt hold up well without any other toppings and not being juicy and bloody as ordered. The lettuce salad was ok, but kind of out of place here when yearning for some real toppings on my burger instead. There were also two different types of pickles that were tasty, but still not enough to redeem this.nnThe one saving grace of our whole meal was the fries they were fantastic. Large, natural cut, with what seemed to be sea salt sprinkled on them, and they were delicious. If anyone remembers a place called Boardwalk Fries that was around in the late s, this rivaled them. But were here to review a burger, and the burger wasnt right. Being able to properly deliver on an order is a huge part of my review, so if you fail to cook my burger properly when it costs as much as this one does is a total fail. I refuse to send a burger back during this review process, although sometimes I might be depriving myself of something better. Either way, for  this burger is not worth it."
0,"I wanted to like this place...its one of the only quick bites on this side of the center. I wasnt greeted at the door and I had to say hello at the register to the young workers. I asked if I could add turkey into the Big Cheese Classic, but they said they did not have turkey. So I still went with a classic grilled cheese! Cant go wrong, right? Wrong.  First I saw him put lots of mayo on each bread which I thought was weird and extra fattening. They brought it to me with just the Gouda and Swiss cheese. I asked wheres the cheddar!? And the guy said he didnt realize its made with all three cheeses when the big menu is seen stated above where hes making it. They asked if I wanted cheddar duh, and Im not paying over  for nothing and they added it into my already toasted sandwhich. So just more butter added making it tasting over burnt and greasy instead of making me a fresh one from their mistake. Definitely not coming back and will take the extra walk to Paradise Bakery."
0,"Great Hotel  Bad Staff!nnMy girlfriend and I stayed there this weekend and loved the hotel itself. The rooms are nice and spacious, the big bathtubs are great to relax in, and all of the amenities in our suite were excellent. nnHowever, the staff couldnt have been less helpful. When I made our reservation, I informed them wed be checking in late at night. I called the day of our arrival to remind them, specifically asking them to make sure they had a room for us. The man said it wasnt a problem and that hed made a note of it. We arrived and were told a high floor suite with a view of the strip and a king sized bed which Id reserved was not available and were given a suite with two queens and a  credit toward any restaurant on the property. We were also told we could simply switch rooms the next day to a suite like we asked for. Annoying, but not the end of the world, right?nnHeres where the wheels come off. I call the front desk the next morning asking for a room change. I explained what had happened the night before and the guy said he didnt know if they had a room for us, that theyre not obligated to switch rooms, that room switches are based on availability and rarely are granted on weekends, that hed have to check. Lots of attitude. Five minutes later he comes up with a room for us on a low floor, without a view, but with a King sized bed. I said fine just to be done with it.nnThe next day we go to the Bayside Buffet and do what they told us to do  charge it to our room and theyd take  off the charge. The next day we left the hotel. We used the express checkout, and just because I wasnt trusting anyone at that point, I requested a copy of my bill be sent to me via email. I get home tonight and of course they charged us the full amount for the buffet. I just got off the phone with them  more attitude  and finally got the  taken off the bill.nnLong story notsoshort the staff are rude, not very accommodating, and be sure to check your bill!nnp.s. The valet didnt know when check out was. Who doesnt know the check out time of their own hotel??"
0,"We had a  person luncheon event here and Id say the service and food were marginal. For example, I made the mistake of ordering my salad with dressing on the side. This caused  people to be served and one to sit and wait at least  minutes for lettuce and tomato assembly. These guys may be fine for dinner, but Id never do another group event. They were a pain in the butt to deal with."
0,"We started with the fried pickles...they were awesome!  Because they werent chips but the quartered pickle, it was a nice change from what you normally get at other restaurants.  Then, we ordered the combo sampler platter and hot link plate to try everything.  The chicken was dry, the ham seemed like they bought it from the deli counter at the local grocery store but all the other meats were right on.  The ribs and brisket were very tender.  We were very disappointed that only one barbeque  sauce was available.  Thank goodness we thought to ask because they offered a hot version of their signature sauce that was a little better.  It was, by no means, hot but that extra kick made it more enjoyable.  We are still trying to figure out what Guy Fieri meant by this sauce is money.  It costs money, thats about it."
0,"Not a good place to go for late night eats.  Went there after pm because most of the restaurants are closed.  Although a few of the workers there were friendly, the service was pretty bad.

Best worker we saw was the bus boy who was kind enough to get us some water since weve been waiting so long. nnYou know this place has a problem if you see the manager walking around and doesnt noticeor care if people are ok, need drinks, or even bother to check on the other employees to see if they need help.  Cmon!nnThis place needs some better management and organization skills.  If the bus boy is doing the best job out of all the employees there, I believe there is a problem."

0,"The last  times Ive used the pharmacy Ive had issues with them not running my insurance correctly even though my plan hasnt changed in years. They always make it seem like its my fault and that I dont have coverage, when I do. The wait at the drive thru is too long which takes away from the convenience of it. On one occasion they asked me to come inside after  minutes in the drive thru and then wait in line again, all because of their mistakes. The staff dont appear knowledgeable. I think its time to switch pharmacies."
0,"I didnt have the highest of expectations for the Luxor, but it failed to even meet the bar that had been set so low.nnMy friend and I checked in at about am on a Friday nightSaturday morning and went straight to bed.  So far, so good.  When we woke up in the morning, I walked into the bathroom and the floor was wet.  I asked my friend if they had taken a shower before I had woken up.  They told me they hadnt.  I walked into the bathroom again and saw that there was a leak... it was coming from the light.  Now I know that sometimes these things happen, and I would normally feel bad for giving a place  star for something that mightve been out of their control, but their customer service was so atrocious that I feel really justified in giving them the lowest grade possible.nnThe first time we called the front desk, they told us they were going to send an engineer up to fix the leak.  After waiting for an hour without a visit from the engineer, we gave the front desk a call and they told us they were going to switch us into another room and that someone needed to go to the desk to retrieve the new room keys.  When my friend arrived at the front desk, the clerk was rude and not apologetic at all.   We werent being nitpicky about the leak.  The whole floor of the bathroom was soaked within minutes.  We werent expecting to be waited on hand and foot, an they were still rude.  Sincerity would go a long way, Luxor."
0,We were desperate so we stopped at Gilleys without looking reviews. There were  of us so we all got a little bit off the menu. Everyone pretty much hated what they ordered. My burger was had absolutely no taste to it. We all ate our food because we needed something to soak up the alcohol not because we actually liked the food. I expected more from a restaurant in Las Vegas.
0,"Odd menu, poor choices, poorly presented. The way the food is served is strange, they give you the cooked meat, with the flavor sauce on the side. Good rice. I was disappointed with the menu it is very limited as far as Asian restaurants go. They have no side dishes... I mean really? What is a Chinese dinner without a few side dishes? Comfortable dining room and a nice bar. The service was marginal, the  waiters seemed confused and not familiar with the menu, even as small as it is. They scrambled and wanted to charge me for a  dollar dinner, just because I wanted a side of noodles. I will not go back. Disappointing if you are used to really good Chinese food. To sum it up... find another place!"
0,"Came here with a couple of friends last Dec.  We had the waffle fries with cheese and bacon and something else to munch on I dont remember what the other food item we ordered was, and the food was okay.  For drinks, we opted for cocktails.

I dont remember what it was supposed to be they dont have a drink menu on the website otherwise I could probably figure it out, but I remember it just tasted off, to the point that I couldnt finish it and that never happens with me with cocktails.  My friends both tasted it and agreed.nnService was on the slow side, but then again, it was happy hour, and they were understaffed.  It seemed like a fun spot to have a few drinks after workthe crowd seemed to be mostly young professionalsand they have a decent variety of food to choose from.  I wanted to like this place, and Id go back and give it another try, but I was underwhelmed on my first visit.  . stars."
0,"Not recommended. The server was amazing, she gets  stars. However,  the chef obviously doesnt taste hisher food. I ordered Pho,  the broth was horribly bland and one of the key ingredients tripe was omitted.  I also ordered traditional a spring roll. The spring roll wasnt too bad but the peanut sauce didnt even have any peanuts in it. Nice atmosphere,  great service,  but horrible Pho!nIf you enjoy Pho....do not choose Rice Paper."
0,"Being new to the Phoenix area we were looking forward to finding a Thai restaurant, since we eat Thai fairly often. Going off of the Yelp reviews, we decided to try Swaddee. We ordered the Tom Ka soup with tofu instead of chicken, and the Pad Seeew with soft tofu, and the veggie rolls to go. The veggie rolls were tasty and larger than were used to, which was a nice surprise. The Tom Ka soup was a little more sour than were used to, but overall still tasty. However, it was almost  which we felt was about double what it should have cost. The Pad Seeew was the most disappointing part of the meal. The flavor was fine, nothing special but not bad. However, it was pretty dry and sticky, like youd expect from a cheap college Thai takeout joint.nnOverall nothing really stood out. We had high hopes since the meals were on the pricey end for takeout, but weve had far better Thai for half the price. Well keep looking for a better Thai place to become our local goto!"
0,"Decided to try this establishment on a Friday night and was highly disappointed. The food was incredibly bland and over cooked. I tried the legendary fried rice with veggies and tofu. The tofu was not prepared correctly read mushy like mashed potatoes and the only extra veggies were snap peas. My husband tried the Thai street noodles. It was basically yaki soba noodles with a spice and was clearly not Thai. His noodles were so over cooked they were almost crunchy. Our server topped the experience off with not knowing how to describe the food and alcohol menu. Should have known this place was a bust since there were  other patrons dinning. Save you self time and money, dont bother with this place."
0,"Im sorry to say that I did not have a great experience here.  I really wanted to like this place, I really did.  Perhaps it was what I ordered but all the plates around me looked amazing, mine well.... not so much.  I had fish tacos and asked them to be grilled instead of fried, perhaps that was the issue.  They were awful and the portion was paltry. I was NOT impressed and the cost was high for what I got.  However I must say again that all the food around me looked really good.  I will try this place again and order something different and ReYelp.  Also the beautiful sunny day I was there, I sat outside and the service was horrible.  The tables were not cleaned off and I sat unnoticed for about  minutes.  With all the great reviews I am going to chalk my experience up to Kaya having a bad day or short staffed.  I am hoping my next visit garners  stars."
0,"Dirty tap lines are the norm here.  They had an Orange HefeWeizen once, and every beer that replaced it on that tap line has had an orange taste.  Often its something quite obvious, like a pilsener, where the orange comes right out.nnTheres a putrid sewer smell that wont go away from this location.  Im not sure if it is too costly to get rid of it, but it is there every time Ive made a visit in hopes that the place will improve.nnMenu is pretty much the same as all the other Old Chicago chain restaurants.  Pizza is average, and offers little in variety.  They dont do a traditional Chicago pizza like Ginos or Giordanos, and in fact one of their specialty Chicago crusts is just simply the addition of corn meal.nnMusic is often too loud, and the jukebox seems to attract the Nine Inch Nails type of crowd with a pocket full of quarters.  Service is inconsistent and often poor."
0,"We tried the Margherita, New Yorker, and Cal Italia.  Personally, I like the antipasti classic meatballs.  nnThe service was poor at best.  I realize it was packed so they dont get one more star taken off.  We never had water without asking and when we did ask they ignored us.  What really cost them points is seeing others come in after us get their pizza before us.  Our  year old was already done with her Mac and Cheese before they came to check on us, only to realize we hadnt eaten.nnIt wouldnt have been so bad if we werent there for a birthday dinner.  The manager was sent over, he apologized and said he would put in a rush and make something special.  Well all the pizzas came out burnt.  The rock hard crust had me gasping for air or water to wash it down only when I reached for the water... you guessed it, I didnt have any.nnOne last chance, happy birthday song...  Nope they were too busy.   nnWhen it came time for the check they chraged us for an apple juice which should have come with the kids menu.  Live and learn."
0,"I was so excited when the new location finally opened in Mesa.  I have been a loyal fan of Beaver Choice, and have highly recommended to all my friends to try it.  Tonight, I was extremely disappointed at the whole dining experience. nnWe had all placed our orders at the same time. The waitress indicated that the kitchen was behind and it will take about  minutes to put the ticket inside.  We agreed.  Another friend came after we just placed the order, sat over  minutes without any type of service no water or even a menu.  She had to get up to ask for them.  I know you have expanded but might just need to hire more staff to help on weekends.  We all had to ask for refills many times.    nnAfter  hour of waiting, we noticed the tables around came after us got their foodneven few ate and left.  I felt it was a deja vu moment reminded me the very first time I visited in the Tempe location.  They had lost our ticket and we waited over an hour too. However, the owner came out to our table to apologize.  nnThis time when the owner came around to chat, we mentioned we have not received our food and indicated that tables around already ate and left. By now, its over an hour!  nWe are very patient people, others would have left by now.     nnThe owner came back with our waitress showing us the time that the waitress placed our orders on the POS receipt.  We knew we had placed the orders way before time indicated on the receipt.  The owner kept telling us they prepare it freshly and will take time to cook.  Again, I was loyal customer so I should know how long a normal schnitzel takes.  Over  hour is just unacceptable!  I felt I was in the episode of Amys Baking Company when the owner accused the customers they were wrong.  I know the owner here is not Amy and Sammy. The family working in this establishment are much better than that.   I really hope tonight was just an onetime incident."
0,"Automatic  gratuity on parties of  and more.  No separate checks.  Tiny tiny portions for the money.  Seriously,  for  corn tortilla enchiladas.  The rice was hard, the beans were dry.  A message that says, one complimentary refill of chips and salsa.  Who charges extra for chips and salsa?  At a mexican restaurant...and one that s much more expensive and less than average quality.  Seriously, I love my fellow yelpers, but this is not authentic mexican food.  Its just bad.  I understand that Phoenix has much to be desired in this area, but yeah.  To be fair this was just one time here....they may just be inconsistent and have good food other nights, but the portions are not likely to change."
0,"This is a review of my gambling experience. I was having a good time at the casino even though I was down. Then it seemed like I was constantly harassed for my social security number. One of the hosts gave me some bullshit answer when I asked why, so I gave them a bullshit social security number. nnAnyway, I know the reasons why a casino needs a social security number for gamblers, and I didnt fit into that criteria. I was down, and I dont think I was at the k transaction threshold yet. I got annoyed and left. nnI know a few other people they harassed as well. Wynn is a very nice hotel, but I dont gamble there anymore."
0,"This place is the equilvalent of a grownup Chuck E. Cheese.... It is loud  there are huge TVs everywhere. The food is reasonably priced and pretty good. I would eat it again. Just not often. We went there for a birthday party and it was really hard to hear anything people were saying, even the people sitting right next to you. Id have given it  stars for the food and prices except that it was just too loud and chaotic there for me. There were about  games going on at once on the TVs. Plus, there were pool tables, pingpong, and trivia. With all the of people talking and the music and the games, it was just too much! I wouldnt hang out their all the time but fun once in a while. Oh, The lunch specials are an excellent deal and even come with a beer! How cool is that!?! A free beer with lunch? Awesome!"
0,"The noodles are freshly made and you can see the chef make it through the window. That made me want to eat here. And the pictures online made it seem really cool. Unfortunately, the food didnt live up to my expectations. The place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it. The noodle, however, was really good. The texture and freshness was great. nI probably will not be going here again. Just doesnt seem worth it when you have so many choices in Las Vegas."
0,"Note that this review is solely for the pancakes specifically the banana nut ones. If you go there, get something else. After all, other reviewers seem to like this place okay. Each pancake was like a thick slab of cardboard. They were way too dry. You could barely choke them down, and when I drenched them in syrup to try and moisten them up to the point where the syrup was nearly overpowering, it was still too dry. Once again, I dont know about the other food, but go somewhere else for pancakes."
0,"Terrible place. Drug deals and fighting at all hours, noisy neighbors and police are there so much they need their own unit! The fire department is constantly being called because children play with the alarms. Management is horrible!! Try to make this a last resort and only if you are desperate!"
0,"This review is for customer service only.  I have not tried any pastries, but I didnt want to after our experience.nnMy fiancue and I frequent the Tea Station on the floor below Crown Bakery, but we wanted to try something a little different.  We walked into the Crown Bakery to see what they offer, and after reading lots of Yelp reviews, I was super excited.  I will say, the place is super cute and cozy hence two stars instead of one.  I immediately noticed that they also serve boba drinks  the sign on the wall gave a list of their offerings.  I love boba, and I love to try boba all over the city.  Curious, I asked the lady behind the counter if that was a complete list of what they make.nnWell.  I guess Im a moron, because she said, WHAAAAT??!?  WE DONT SERVE BOOOOBBBAAAA HERE!  with her eyebrows waggling.  She told us to go down to Tea Station if we wanted boba... she was so rude about it, like I was a total idiot for asking.  Then she proceeded to cackle like a damn witch.  I said, but, but, but... they are listed on the menu..., stumbling all over myself because her behavior just wasnt appropriate for the situation.  It reminded me of Saturday Night Live.  It would make a good segment... she could be a good regular character!  They could call her Inappropriate Reaction Sally.  It was such a bizarre exchange of words that I started laughing.  She was laughing at me, and I was laughing at her.  Dueling cackles.  Cue banjos.nnNope, I wont be ordering pastries anytime soon.  In fact, I took her advice and headed on down to Tea Station, my regular hangout.  Good advice, Inappropriate Reaction Sally.  That might have been the most intelligent and appropriate thing you said all day."
0,"Did not have such a great experience tonight at CKs. Not sure what was going on. We have been here quite a few times in the past few months and I have come to the realization that CKs is just okay most of the time. They do a few things really well and most others not so much. I really like the original burger sliders and the pulled pork sliders. I also enjoy the boneless hot wings. Other than that, my experience has not been very good.nnService is pretty good most of the time. Tonight it took at least ten minutes after being seated to be greeted. Our waitress did apologize and she look stressed so I felt for her. We ordered the pepperjack cheese dip with tortilla chips. It was not good. It was pretty much velveeta heated up in a cup and the chips were extremely stale, tasted like they had been sitting around for at least a month in an opened bag. I ordered the french dip sandwich for my entree see attached pic. It looked pretty good. Looks can be deceiving. It was bad. The beef tasted off. Like beef that had been sitting around too long. Very unappetizing. After two bites I was done. All of the food in general looked old and not at all fresh tonight. A huge turn off. If our dinner was this bad, how bad was the food in kitchen? Just an all around bad experience tonight.nnI still gave two stars because I think that this place still has potential. I am asking that if the manager or owner read this, please take note of this experience tonight. Take a look in the kitchen and make some improvements."

Las Vegas.nnI purchased a Gel Manicure through GROUPON  and the vendor was  LV Nails by Christine in Body Spa on Charleston and Durango.nnI verbally set the appointment up with Christine several days prior.   I go into the Salon for the time we verbally confirmed on and she takes my Groupon  scans and redeems the code, and then tells me I did not have an appointment until the following week, then precedes to call me a liar  and tells me she never told me that date and time.   She then tells me she sent me an email confirming the date and time, and I asked to see it, cause I told her I did NOT receive an email just a verbal confirmation for todays appointment....but she COULD NOT find the email  then she starts yelling at me that she knows she sent it  ?????nnI HAVE had my nails done for years and years, and I can NEVER EVER EVER, recall a Nail girl being a RUDE OBNOXIOUS person  they are always as NICE as can be.   The only reason I got this, is because my nail girl doesnt do gels, and I wanted to try it out.  I WILL NEVER go back to that shop and have to look at that RUDE Christine woman again !nnNow I have to deal with fighting Groupon to get a refund, for a code that she ALREADY redeemed without doing my nails!!!   Hope this doesnt happen to ANYONE else.....that is why I took more of my time today to write this !!!nnEPIC FAILED ATTITUDE by Christine !!!!nnB. Larson"
0,"I was really hoping to like  Mexican Grill based on the great things Ive heard about it.nnWent in Saturday evening after finding out that Cantina had a two hour wait   . nnStarted with the Sangria which was a little to sweet for me. I wouldnt have believe there was red wine in it and despite its large size and my empty stomach id say they were on the weak side. nnWe first asked for Guacamole and our server asked us if we would like it tableside and if we wanted one avocado or two. We gave him our answer but we were never given our Guacamole. When our meals came out I assumed he must have forgotten so I asked for it again and he came back and asked the same questions as he did previously, almost acting like we had never originally asked for it...no apology either. I will say once we did receive it I really enjoyed it. nnMy enchiladas were nothing special  it was quite a sad dish really. Nothing tasted fresh nothing was exciting about the dish.nnI am not sure that id go back. I love Cantina and La Paz and this restaurant cannot compete in my opinion."
0,"I read all the great reviews and decided to give it a try. Im scratching my head at how people think the chips and salsa were amazing..Tasted like they opened it from a store bought bag. Now that I think of it, all of the food tasted like they pulled it out of the freezer. Couldve gone to trader joes  bought some microwave mexican food that was just as good and saved"
0,"I went here yesterday and was soo dissapointed. I really needed a car wash, mostly on the inside of my car so I decided that I would splurge and get the superworks car wash,  steps up from the basic wash. nIt was a disaster, They did a terrible job of cleaning it, there were more then a few spots that looked like they werent wiped down at all. nAnd they didnt put the air freshner in my car! nI had to stay for after they were finished and tell them everything that was wrong with the car. It was really awkward cause I felt rude having to point out all that they didnt do, but I really neeeded my car to be cleaned and I paid double of what I would of on a basic wash so I figured I might as well get it fixed while I was there. nI felt even worse becasue the staff were all so nice, well  mostly the main guy that was helping me. He sincerely apologized several times and hooked me up with a free car wash card for next time, so that was nice. But I  kind of feel like I still need a car wash, so I might be  using that really soon. nIt just seems like the owner of this place has checked out and doesnt really care about it anymore. It seems like the staff is left up to their  devices and  are trying to do the best they can with the place. nI am totally guessing but thats the vibe I got from it. nThe store was empty which was dissapointing because I was planning on buying accessories for my car and a snack for the wait. nThen there were no paper towels in the bathroom and the girl behind the counter said that she had asked her boss to get more but he never did."
0,"Located in Summerlin but for some reason sporting a pair of security officers at the door during both of my visits it seems somewhat strange to me that this book store needs much protection given the uppermiddle class clientele, but what is even more perplexing to me is how this place stays in business considering their acrosstheboard high prices and substantial overcrowding of the floor space.  Generally trending  higher than Amazon even before taking tax into account and seemingly happy to hire clerks that value neither their own knowledge of the store layout nor the customers time the only positive I can say for BN is that it is within walking distance of my house and when I need something now I dont need to wait for shipping."
0,Ate at cosmos on a Thursday bogo on tapas ordered chicken quesadilla n needed more sour cream n was charged  cent! Ridiculous I will never patronize again. Also the food is just ok not the greatest they should b glad u stop in with all the other choices.
0,"This was our nd time there. st time was not very good burgers were overcooked and flatbread was dry like cardboard, but thought we would give them another try. This time was horrible. There were  tables in the restaurant and it took over  minutes to get food to our table. Both the sliders and charr burger, ordered medium, we well done and too dry to eat. They offered to make new burgers, but since it took  minutes to get our food, there was not enough time to wait for them to make new food.nnThe table next to us also had overcooked burgers and were also upset.nnToo bad, we live close, but would rather make the drive to Delux."
0,"I see some good reviews for this place, so that leads be to believe they might have some consistency problems. Perhaps their nd shift cook isnt putting the love into the food that the st shift cook does? Who knows. All I know is this. Im going to rank my grievances with this place in order. nn. BBQ chicken is not supposed to be unseasoned fried chicken. Most places smoke their chicken then pull it. That seems to be the standard which I have began to expect. I know the menu doesnt say pulled chicken, but when I see chicken on the menu in a BBQ place, I sure dont expect a bland fried chicken legthigh combo. nn. Burnt ends not even edible. A little fat is one thing, but an entire appetizer of burnt ends and ALL of it was fat? Cmon now...Thats just lazy. Burnt ends are basically the end piece of a smoked brisket. They are known for being HEAVY on the smoke flavor, while also very tender and flavorful. The burnt ends I got at porkopolis were just pieces of fat cut off of an unseasoned brisket. If anything, it just opened my eyes to how bad the brisket was going to be, because I tasted NO smoke in the burnt ends, which is a really bad thing for BBQ. nn. The brisket not only lacked seasoning and smoke flavor, it was tough as beef jerky! This was the worst brisket Ive ever eaten. Wow...Unseasoned, fatty pieces of brisket that wasnt smoked enoughIF AT ALL and was tough because it wasnt cooked slow enough. As a brisket lover, this was a sin to me. nnThose  things ruined my meal for me. The pulled pork wasnt bad. It was noticeably more smoked, but AGAIN, not seasoned enough. It was bland. nnThe BBQ sauce they feature there is actually pretty good in my opinion. Bradys bbq has some good flavor. Too bad its being wasted on VERY POORLY cooked bbq meats. nnThe sides were decent. The cornbread wasnt bad, a little too cakey but had good flavor. The mac and cheese wasnt bad either. The cream corn was something both me and my girlfriend liked a lot, so good job there. The baked beans tasted like hormel chili. We couldnt finish that nor did we take it with us. Finally, the apple crisp with ice cream was tasty. The dessert was by far my favorite part of an otherwise forgettable meal. Honestly I hope they figure this BBQ thing out and fire whoever cooked last night. Find someone who knows how to operate a smoker and season their food please. nnFinally, the service was good. The tall, pretty, blonde girl was very nice. It wasnt her fault!nnThis place is so close to home. I really hope they get their act together so we can try them again."
0,"This place has been here for a long time but I think its still trying to figure some things out  The menu is very ambitious for a campustown location, serving up campustown pizza along side upscale AmericanFrenchItalian fare.  The dining room is upstairs and is nice enough in a traditional way, but the look and ambience are very dated.  The quality of service is not in line with the menu.  Our server was clearly overwhelmed.  Our table had white linens bespeaking of a nice restaurant but was set improperly.  Wrong silverware, no bread plates.  We sat for quite some time before our drink order was taken, then our waiter left in the middle of taking the drink order to serve food to another table.  He eventually returned to take our drink order and then asked us for our entire food order at the same time.  Bread service was slow though the bread was good.  The glass of riesling we ordered was clearly from a bottle that had been left open for too long.  Another glass from a fresh bottle arrived after a while.nnWe ordered some salads to start off the meal.  The bistro salad looked great  field greens, asparagus, potato, poached egg, bacon, vinaigrette.  However, when the salad arrived, there was no bacon.  Ahem.  Excuse me, but our salads have no bacon.  Response OMG, forgot the bacon.  Instead of taking our salads away and giving us new ones, we were given small bowls of bacon pieces to put on the salads ourselves.  Please.nnWe ordered a wild mushroom pizza with sausage and gorgonzola but we wanted to substitute goat cheese for the gorgonzola.  We were told this was not possible.  Restaurant policy is no substitutions, just subtractions.  We could remove the gz but could not add goat cheese.  We ended up using the build your own pizza option and built the pizza we wanted.  What a pain in the a!  The pizza was delicious though.  The thin crust must be one of the best Ive ever had.nnThe entrees were generally very good.  The American kobe skirt steak was tasty, having a sweet marinade reminiscent of Korean kalbi in flavor.  The duck breast was well prepared.  The trout was overcooked but was still edible.nnThe desserts were adequate and there is a good selection of after dinner drinks and dessert wines.nnIn summary, Timpones has an identity crisis.  If they want to serve this type of food, then there is a level of service that is expected to go along with it which they did not meet.  Its hard to enjoy any restaurant when you are unhappy with the service.  My recommendation is to go for the pizza  then you wont need a bread plate."
0,I just bought a couple display cases and the ones I bought werent even the same ones on the display. I made  trips back and forth to ask questions and swap some out. Customer service was not as good because the lady working said we can refund them if I wanted to but would be a charge since I already assembled them. This place might be cheaper than other places but make sure you ask them every detail about the product before purchasing.
0,"Ugh, this place is terrible!  It looks good, and it smells good, but it unfailingly ALWAYS disappoints!  I seriously have not had one dish that tasted close to right.  Its salty and very flavorful, but somehow it just tastes off.  Ive tried a lot of dishes here too."
0,"Im not happy with Marcos. My son loves their pizza and weve been there many times and yes, usually its a bit of a wait whether youre dining in or getting delivery. By wait, I mean  minutes or so for dine in. Tonight I got there at . I ordered a small cheese pizza.  minutes later Im still waiting and we were the only dine in customers. I finally asked when my pizza would be ready and was told  minutes.  mins later its still not ready nor was it even made yet! I asked for my money back and was again given the run around for another  minutes. At this point its almost pm and we have no pizza and now they wont refund my money. One employee told me no one but the manager can issue refunds and hes busy so Ill just have to wait. I was livid. My child is extremely hungry, hes waited an hour for pizza that isnt coming and now I feel like Im stuck there because they cant figure out how to void my order. Finally the manager comes over with my voided order and tells me half heartedly,sorry."
0,"It took him a year to respond to my post and this is some sort of back handed apology I think...for some reason stating that I have a low income or that I am on a fixed budget.  I see there are a whole two positive reviews on here! Wow...  There are a lot of pool companies in the phoenix area.  Im not trying to refer anyone in particular but I would guess there are many better than this one.  This all came from one bad experience.  The explanation of the experience I gave was correct.  The situation was handled very poorly by dan and this response to a post on yelp, which had a few more lies in it, just calls his character into question a little more.  Ive left this alone for a year now, I had one bad experience and explained it just to let other people know of what I went through.  That is the reason yelp is here Dan, to give examples of good and bad experiences.  You responding in this way just shows your lack of integrity and capabilities as a business owner.  If you do use this company good luck and I really do hope dan has improved on on the way that he conducts his business because all I see is lies and trying to cover up the mistake that he made in past.  I thought this was over but him questioning my integrity is not right.  His pool tech never came by that week to find a locked gate, he simply did not show.  He did over charge me and became very defensive upon me even asking about it.    nnI just can not believe he would say some of those things that he did in his response.  It is very disappointing that a childish response to my one year old post was something that dan felt he needed to do."
0,"I lived in Negley Court apartments. The good was that it was relatively economical. The bad the place was quite dirty, the garage run down water leaks and filth and overall the place in pretty bad repair. nnThis is all stuff you can put up with. What was amazingly unpleasant and very unprofessional was the property manager Mary Blocher. I found her to be generally lazy, rude and highly uncooperative. In the end it was even impossible to get her to do a handover when I moved out there was nobody there to take the keys. Ultimately I had to contact her manager to get the deposit back. He claimed that shed been put on a different job, alas, as I can see, shes still working there. Easily the worst property manager I ever had the misfortune of interacting with.nnAnd yes, I did not want to post this review while I was still renting for fear of retaliation."
0,I used to go here all the time.  When i moved back to the area i was excited to go back.  I was dissapointed.  I am not sure if they are using bad product or what.  The gel polish peeled off.  My nails were lifting. Several issues over a  month period.
0,I went when it first opened and thought it was pretty lame. I was very excited about it and expected more. My friends had not been yet so I gave it another chance tonight. Its still just as cheesy as the first time and you can tell everything is fake but it was fun with our group of  after drinks.  Definitely not worth the full price or the locals discount. We found an offer at vegaslocals.com which made each ticket . Thats a fair price for the minute scare.
0,Things seemed promising when we walked in. The atmosphere seemed like a fun English Pub Style with lots of wood and some stone work.nnThings seemed even more promising when they presented us with samples of complimentary beer.nnThen things went down hill.nnWe ordered two pasties. nThe waitress come back a few minutes later and says they are out of one of them. No big deal we pick another. nA few minutes latter the waitress comes back again and says they are out of our second choice  so another few minutes pass by and they are out of the second choice. So we have to make a third choice but dont pick the chicken one because we are out of that one two because our baker isnt in yet. The waitress says you can have the meat n taters for free so my husband asks whats in the meat in taster? The waitress wasnt trained to know what was in it so she just got a menu for my husband to read and he says OK.nnSo Im thinking only yesterdays leftovers are available.nnWe wait a long time for the meat hand pies to arrive.nnUnfortunately I didnt check my silverware until my food arrived. The first two silverwares I unrolled WERE FILTHY! see photo the other rolls didnt look as bad so I used my water to wash them down. I NOTE IF I KNEW THESE WERE SO FILTHY I WOULD HAVE LEFT before the food arrived. I couldnt help but thinking if the silverware was THAT BAD then maybe the plates and pots and pans might be just as BAD OR WORSE. n nnOur Meat Pies arrive and mine the Traditional isnt awful but isnt so good. I think the recipe is good meaning if it was made fresh it would be good but the one I had was all dried out inside with dry meat in it and I already know it was leftover from at least yesterday. I did the right thing and told my waitress and she apologized but I do think management should have made an appearance at this point.nnMy stomach is spinning and I use the restroom. see photo  Then my stomach turned even more from the sewage smell and over flowing garbage. It looked like Sara Silvia Stout was in charged of the garbage duty.......Google Sara Silvia Stout Song.nnThis place has potential but nManagement needs to train staff on menu.nManagement needs to have someone on who can make the pasties during opening hours.nManagement needs to supervise basic cleaning duties.nManagement needs to take an interest in on going problems.nnNo I will not return or recommend.nnDraft House or Drek House?
0,"Tried this place for the first time tonight. It is close to my house and offered gluten free pizza. I ordered for pick up small pizza  only available size for gluten free and a tomato burrata appetizer. nn pizza is . Then an additional  for the gluten free crust. Then  per topping. nSo youre looking at a  dinky pizza with bell peppers, mushrooms, and  spinach leaves  yes,  leaves for !.nnThe tomato and burrata was a complete rip off at . Was a slab of cheese, a few shreds of basil, and  very tiny, cold tomato wedges another Yelper posted that she got  small wedges and felt the proportion of tomatoes to cheese was lacking so you can imagine mine. The container included a two small sauce cups, one with olive oil and the other with a balsamic reduction. nnThe cheese and balsamic sauce were actually tasty. The tomatoes were not sweet and they were cold. Fresh tomatoes shouldnt be refrigerated. nnThe pizza was okay and I could see ordering it again IF it werent  a pop when I can make a comparable one with organic ingredients at home for . nnSo total was  including a  tip. nNot worth the price for the foodportions"
0,"Id give  star if I could... The only reason I considered this buffet was because I was supposed to receive a complimentary for dinner voucher for the buffet with our hotel reservation.  Upon check in, we did not receive any of our coupons or promotions, or even reminded of any. nnWhen we arrived at the buffet, we realized that we were supposed to receive a coupon. I spoke with the Manager of the buffet to see if he would allow us, all they had to do was just receive confirmation through telephone by calling the lobby.  The manager did not even seem to be the least bit interested in even talking to us. Sure enough, he did not even hesitate to tell us No, Im the manager of the buffet, Im not in charge of coupons.. go to the front desk. So he wanted us to go walk back to the lobby of the casino just to get some coupons that he should be able to validate with a simple phone call? Yes... nnTo make this short.. not worth getting into specifics.. we had received a dinner coupon voucher needed lunch coupon voucher at the lobby front desk. We figured its about  minutes until dinner it was , dinner starts at , even that incompetent manager shouldnt have a problem with this. Just let us pay for the dinner price, which was in  minutes, DURING lunch. WRONG! nnWhen the manager returned, looked like he didnt want to talk to us we told him our situation again. Before I finished a sentence the manager said.. We dont do this normally, but I dont want to deal with this anymore... since the front desk cant get it right go in.. Ill just wait until dinner time to charge you. Never again.. nnnThis is NOT a reflection of the hotel room or the servers at the buffet.nI just wish that the MANAGER would have given us better service than what we received, which was close to nothing."
0,DecorLocation  OLD and dim.     The location is good and close to a lot of things.  It is across from the MM store.  Small casino area within hotel. nnService   Resort fee per day with the pool closed    what resort???nnFoodDrinks  The food court there is good.  It has better food selection than other places.  The Italian place and the fish  chip are awesome for the value nnValue   about  a night for the regular older room.nnKid Friendly  They have a tiny arcade for older kids.. not for the small fries.nnRecommendation  I will go somewhere else next time.
0,"Blechh.  nnClearly its not just me  the owners need to spend some time traveling to Milwaukee and eating at a place like Riviera Maya, or even El Rey.  This is just crappy food.  How do you screw up pinto beans or pico de gallo?  Ive never eaten Mexican food with so little flavor.  I asked for hot sauce, they brought me red sauce with pepper seeds in it, and it had NO flavor, and NO heat.  What??  And to make this more memorable you can buy the flavorless sauce to go.  I actually had to salt my food, which I never, ever do in a restaurant.  And the rice tasted like it was made with old onion that had been prechopped and stored in the frig  you know that taste?  It tastes like your old college roommates shoes smelled.  nnI make far better Mexican from scratch.  Heck, Ortega makes better.  nnDrive  more blocks and go to La Guadalajara, WAY better."
0,Completely ruined by putting parking in the middle of the shops. Never enough parking here but mixing cars and pedestrians is never a good thing. Lots of families milling around and now you have to worry about cars. Complete stupidity.
0,"So I went in thinking they actually make these things from scratch. Which  of the time means real ingredients. nI looked at the croissants and they looked unappetizing, the decription sounded good but the didnt look flakey or anything. nWhich was a sign of hydrogenated oil, for some reason it weighs croissants down and is not only worse for you than saturated fat it makes them taste like shit. nnI asked the woman if there was partially hydrogenated oil in any of the food or margairine which has trans fat. She went and get the  yr old baker. nnWho told me they dont make the icing which has partially hydrogenated oil. nWTF!! why would I just go to the grocery store if I didnt care about the oil. I could get  unfresh pasteries for this price?nThe make there shit from a mix and have premade icing. nThat is literraly the dumbest thing I have heard of.  I am definetly sending them an email, because if they dont even make there food than there is actually no point."
0,"I had such a bad experience with this dry cleaner that Ive literally been thinking about writing this review for monthsnow that my Yelp account is up and running, this business is first on my list of reviews to write.nnThe customer service was extremely poor  the business is advertised as a  hr Cleaner  per their own sign and when I requested that a suit be cleaned by the following day, the girl working behind the desk gave me a really hard time, saying it would be difficult, etc., etc. What the heck? Are you a one hour cleaner or not? After some back and forth, we established that my suit would be clean by the next day.nnThen, as she was looking through my pile of clothes she just handed me back a tank top that had a small stain, simply saying she wouldnt be able to get it out. Im sorry, but the reason I bring stained clothes to the dry cleaner is so they can at least attempt to take the stain out  if theyve tried and failed, thats fine. But handing me back a shirt after a cursory glance and flatout telling me its ruined isnt exactly a best effort.nnNeedless to say, I left this dry cleaner with a sour taste in my mouth. Just allaround bad customer service and mediocre drycleaning."
0,"Eek! Methinks not is exactly what I think about this production.nnFirst of all, Le Reve is NOT a Cirque du Soleil production rather, it was created by Franco Dragone who also produced O, Quidam, Mystere, Alegria and La Nouba O and Mystere at the Bellagio and TI, respectively which are Cirque du Soleil shows.nnNow that thats been cleared up...nnMaybe its because I saw O before I saw Le Reve, but I felt like I paid a hefty price for a knockoff. Yes, its a spectacle, but not the most spectacular in Vegas of its kind and, if were being nitpicky about what came first, not the most original. nnDragone is a visionary and that goes undisputed. But my recommendation is O over Le Reve."
0,"Brilliant food. I opted for the duck tasting menu with wine pairings. Excellent wine selections. Table service was a bit sluggish but passable. But as I was about to pay the bill and leave for the theatre a party of four was seated next to us. Looked like a family Id guess  grandparents, a father, and a son about  years of age. The kid had a couple of electronic toys that made lots of noise. At one point I couldnt hear the conversation at my own table. On my way out I drew this to the attention of the staff who apologized for the noise. I wonder why a classy place like this allows things to come to this. I dont want to listen to other peoples hellions. An unpleasant end to an otherwise excellent meal."
0,"This review is long overdue. I have been to Christophers a handful of times and each time there has been something that has made me question the snotty behavior of our servers. Just because my friends and I are on the younger side of the Christophers crowd read under  and frequent the place for happy hour, does not mean we are trash or deserve to be treated as such. The following is a sampling of true stories that I have encountered. nnScenario   of our party of  waited at the kitchen bar for  minutes after being seated without being acknowledged. No Ill be right with you or any greeting at all. The waiter saunters over and asks if they would like something to drink. How are they supposed to know what they want to drink? They had to ask him for a wine menu and for that matter a dinner menu as well.  minutes of sitting, wondering who their server is, wondering when they would get a menu.... too much wondering. nnScenario  The kitchen bar was full during happy hour so they reluctantly obliged to letting us sit at a high top right by the kitchen bar for happy hour since happy hour is only supposed to be at the kitchen bar and the Crush lounge area. We order our first round of wines and the waiter knocks over a glass of red wine all over one of the girls in our group. LUCKILY she was wearing a dark top anyways but the waiter didnt even apologize. I quote, Obviously I didnt mean for that to happen. That was it. He didnt even help clean it up, he had the busser come over to help her pat down. I understand accidents happen, but apologize for it. Just dont be rude about it. If he would have apologized we would all have a better perception of the place but even beyond that incident, he was short and rude with us the entire time we were there. nnScenario  This scenario is hard to explain via Yelp review, so please forgive me if it seems bluntrudeetc. I will be using terms like Asian and White a lot but none of it is meant to be offensive. My friend and I, and another table of Asians, were the only nonwhite tables at the restaurant. Im not one to judge based on race, but it just so happened to be something I noticed. I overheard a white table ask the server how the ahi tuna was. The server then told the man asking Oh that Chinese guy over there ate it and finished his plate. .... Ummmm what is that supposed to mean? I dont understand the significance of an Asian guy eating the tuna and how that is supposed to make it sound good or make it sound desirable for the other patron of the restaurant. He could have just said that guy over there if he was trying to say other people have ordered it and enjoyed it. His ethnicity had nothing to do with it. nnSo why do I keep going back you might wonder? Well. Their happy hour is amazing. The food and drink specials mean that we go there expecting rude service, we typically get rude service, but we are able to have a nice dinner, a couple glasses of wine, all for about  a person. I will probably go back. I love the wines, the fries, the pizzas, the cheeseburger, and the filet of salmon salad basically the whole hh menu. Depending on the service the next time Im there, I plan on telling Christopher myself. He is usually there but Im not sure how he would react."
0,"Meh is right. Have been here before  yrs ago and was back tonight. This was a solo visit, eating here early enough pm on a Friday before heading off on a flight. nnLets do the good first the service was really good, the ambience the same as I remembered its a kinda modern vibe, and there was nothing actually wrong with the food I had salad to start, fish tacos as main, and a few Negro Modelos to wash it down. They also bring chips and salsa out as part of the deal  and theyre good! nnThe bad the food is.....ok. My salad suffered from that US tendency the sweeten everything up, so while the core ingredients were top notch, the overall salad was a little too much to handle in terms of its sweetness the dressing. Reluctantly, I could only eat half of it.  After which my soft fish tacos arrived. These were the biggest disappointment. Why? Flavour or should I say, flavor. There was none. Seriously. I ended up lumping some salsa and drizzling some lime juice from my chipsnsalsa on to the fish tacos to brighten them up. nnTotal bill for this  beers, starter salad and main tacos was  before tip. So this is the reason Im rating this a two star in the review. Meh indeed! At  allin it would have been disappointing but kinda ok from valueformoney point of view. At  plus a  tip service was good, so  seemed appropriate its a rip. nnNot going again until something changes."
0,"If it was possible, I would give this place ZERO stars, actually negative stars. My family had hands down the WORST service experience here we have ever had at any restaurant in AZ. The sad part is we had been coming to this place for several years now, and even had my th Birthday party with family and friends here last year. We have noticed the both the quality of the food and quality of the service has been severely declining recently. However, tonights debacle takes the cake for all time worst experience ever. Heres what happened... nnWe arrive at  and get a table for  plus a highchair. We are seated within less than  minutes. Server arrives Sean soon after we sit down and gets water for the table. We had to wait a while for him to take our order because he disappeared for a bit... maybe waited  min for him to come back. Here is where things really start to go south... so we are waiting, and waiting, and waiting... at about  he comes out and says our food should arrive shortly. Then  rolls around, still no food. Then the table next to us about  people I think that arrived a good  minutes or so AFTER us gets their food. Then another table that arrives after us gets their food too... then a table of  that arrived literally  minutes ago, gets their food. Now we are thinking something is wrong with this picture.  nnSo we ask for our server, he is no where to be found. So we wait... and wait... and wait... AGAIN. When he does show up, we ask for our food togo because we have been waiting over an hour at this point it was pm and we had no food and had to go because our baby was getting fussy. He takes my husbands credit card to charge us for our food and says he will bring it right back...  minutes later... STILL NO FOOD and no server to be found, which means my husbands card has gone missing. nnIn this time frame I had gone to the front to speak with the Manager with my Mom to let her know what happened and to see if they could locate our server, food and most importantly our credit card. The manager, the sorry excuse for a manager that is, arrives and is downright rude. She never apologizes and only says we are really swamped as I look around at half full rooms of people and say are you serious?. We have been waiting well over an HOUR, all of the tables around us have food, the people that arrived  minutes ago next to us have their food. We want to leave and we want our card now. She disappears in the back and never returns. nnMeanwhile in the dining room... my food arrives at pm and guess what... they put it on FLOUR tortillas, even though I specifically asked for corn and said I cannot have flour because of a gluten intolerance. My husband noticed the mistake and asked the waiter are these flour? My wife cant have flour, we told you that. and the waiter Sean says well yes, but she can just scrape the food off and eat it without the tortilla. WHAT!?!? You have to be kidding me!?!? So someone with an allergy should just scrape food off to eat it?? This is literally no joke... the guy actually said scrape it off, she will be fine nnWe then say, we are leaving please give our card back... and the waiter said he didnt charge it. We get home and check our account... guess what?? THEY CHARGED THE CARD!!! For food that arrived over an hour late, was cold, the wrong thing, and most of all this waiter was so ignorant to suggest scraping it off to eat it. The ignorance and lack of any fiber of customer service or common sense is baffling. nnSave yourself the hassle and go to a different place where the wait staff is helpful, and the food is much better... or even arrives at your table."
0,"The GF and I have heard so many good things about Binkleys over the years from people that we know that have dined there and from reading reviews online. We finally decided that we had to try it to see how it stacked up against Kai, which is our favorite restaurant in the PHX area. I made reservations for Friday night of Memorial Day weekend a little over a week in advance. Since Binkleys is about  miles from the neighborhood that we both live in, we decided to make a weekend of it and stay at The Boulders. The week leading up to the meal, we were both so excited that we both joked that we were getting very little work done due to the anticipation of the amazing meal we were going to have on Friday night.nnFriday finally came and we arrived right on time for our p reservation. We were promptly greeted by the hostess and promptly seated at the absolute worst table in the house. It was in the bar area, right next to the front door. The most insulting part of it was the hostess tried to tell us what an amazing table it was because the vases of flowers that separated our table from the front door were so pretty. In the grand scheme of things, not a big deal if you wow us with the food. After all, we knew from many reviews that atmosphere is not the strong selling point of the restaurant.nnAfter we were seated, we waited for a good  minutes before being greeted by a server. This is one of my pet peeves in a fine dining establishment. I like to be greeted promptly by the server and offered a cocktail so I can enjoy a drink while reviewing the menu. Once we were finally greeted we ordered cocktails and enjoyed them when they were finally served. Being that this was our first Binkleys experience, we both decided that we would go whole hog and order the  course tasting menu with the ea wine pairing. As has been mentioned in may other reviews online, a meal at Binkleys consists of a long parade of amuses. Sadly, in a meal of more misses than hits, the amuses provided more of the hits.nnThe big hit of the night was the summer truffle grits that the GF ordered as her hot appetizer. Both of us agreed that these were amazing. Unfortunately, most everything else was relatively forgettable her halibut fish course was absolutely boring. My quail meat course was quite good, but not something that I would drive  miles to experience again.nnThroughout the night, the service and the pacing was uneven. Sometimes there was a very lengthy time between courses while other courses were brought to quickly. While our main server was perfectly friendly, she lacked fine dining polish and disappeared for long periods of time especially when it was time for the check! several times over the course of the evening.nnAs for the wine pairings, those were also hits and misses. The pourings themselves were quite anemic and with long times between courses, there were several times that I had finished my pour before the course even arrived. For a total of  between the two of us, I felt the wine was a weak spot in the evening.nnThe most entertaining part of the meal was the Gordon Ramsayesque, fbomb laced tirade that Chef Binkley went on at some point during the meal. Apparently his kitchen staff wasnt doing things his way and he was letting them know. Quite comical, although a little uncomfortable to other diners around as we could clearly hear every word that he screamed at his staff.nnWhen all was said and done, we spent a little over  with tip for dinner. While it certainly wasnt the worst meal of either of our lives, we both agreed that it didnt even come near cracking the top . We were both glad that we dined at Binkleys to have the firsthand experience, but we both left feeling that it was overrated. Perhaps they were having an off night, maybe it has slipped over the years, or maybe its just a victim of being overhyped. Whatever the case, I dont think we will be dining at Binkleys in the future."
0,"Okay...Ive been there about  times... and, first through sixth times, each time was a step beneath  the previous visit. In my opinion theyre slipping hard.  The staff is increasingly less and less aware that they are suppose to be attentive to the customers needs. Usually I weigh this adeptness of their job as a major part of the experience. Each time the staff has become more and more invisible.  The service is getting less attentive in a nut shell. The food selection Im finding I dont care for as much as Id remembered.  Seems they have a liking to sprinkle curry on most every dish Ive tried. over done  Best thing about Ticoz is the friends Im usually dining with. Just not that thrilled about going back... to bad..."
0,"I was  a member here at this location ,..For about  months.  I Paid  for a personal trainor . I used just one session. Used only one.  And they refused to give me any money back. I did not like the customer service from the front desk people a lot of the time too.   I am now going to L.A. Fitness and its much better.,,.,Better trainers and much cleaner and friendlier and more proffessional staffing.  InHated losing that four hundred dollars.   This life I guess ,... Lesson learned."
0,"Came here for my birthday which was on a Wednesday in March. The weather was beautiful and breezy. There were some people but there were many open tables so we got right in. We also brought our little dog since we planned to go hiking after and wanted to bring her. It was nice to find a place to bring your four legged friend! Anyways, the first thing we noticed was the self serve coffee, water and lemonade. We actually liked this idea! The only thing that I had an issue with is that they dont mention that there is a charge for the lemonade. They really should have a sign or something that mentions this. While looking over the menu, we noticed that the trees above us kept shedding leaves which we really were not excited about getting into our meals when they arrived. The waitress was really nice and moved an umbrella over to shield us a little from the greenage dropping into our food. nI decided on the monti cristo over easy eggs, ham, and swiss cheese sandwiched between french toast with maple syrup and my husband chose the cheese omelet with home fries. The monti cristo was soooo good. The only issue was that I noticed pieces of paper packaging still on my ham. It wasnt very much but it was a bit irritating having to peel little pieces of paper off of my ham! My husband was not impressed with his meal at all. He said the cheese on the omelet was nothing more than velveeta, the biscuit served with his meal was grainy and tough, and the home fries were not very flavorful. nThe prices were pretty high for breakfast and my husband said his breakfast didnt even fill him up. nAfter breakfast, we walked around the farm a bit which was cool. The only thing we noticed was that there were no signs up next to each crop stating what they were. I would have liked to know what each was. nTo sum it up, it was a nice, peaceful atmosphere and I was happy that I could bring my little doggie. However, I didnt feel it was worth the price and being the fattie that I am, I really dont like to have distractions from eating my meals leaves falling in my food, packaging on my ham.... I dont think we would go back unless our dogs wanted to go our for breakfast. Haha"
0,"I went here for lunch and ordered a sushi combo. They have a combination of chinese dishes and a sushi menu but I havent tried their chinese yet.  The sushi was decent and reasonably priced, but the quality of the fish wasnt that great with some of the tougher portions of the fish included in the cut, though it was adequateedible.  Service really fast to get you seated and get your food, but minimal attention after that.  It gets crowded and tables are really close together.  They also get picky about where you sit and wont let  people sit at a  person table, etc."
0,"BUYER AND CONSUMER BEWARE!!!! I called Gabriels to check out a  year old refrigerator that was working but had stopped cooling. The tech came out and said it needed a new compressor and it would cost me over . almost as much as a brand new unit. I remember the women telling me on the phone when I scheduled the appointment how they were a trusting mom and pop small business and they are trusted in the community and dont fall for these guys on Craigslist and such, but something just didnt seem right. When we asked the tech how could the compressor fail in just over a year he said, you just got a bad one and he left. I decided to get a second opinion. I has another tech come out and he said the compressor is fine and it needed freon so he topped it off and told me it will take  hours to stabilize. Well  days later and it works perfect. The tech from Gabriels never even checked the freon!! Gabriels wanted over . for a part that was in perfect condition, and the repair was actually , thru Appliance Rescue. This is the kind of dishonest service that gives this industry a bad name. I hope everyone learns from my experience and lets businesses like this know that eventually it will catch up to them."
0,"Came here on a whim while walking the strip because we had heard of the goblet drinks. The night was still young, maybe p or so, so it wasnt horribly crowded. nnWe sat at a high table at the bar and already had an idea of what we were going to order. We sat for a while and had waitresses pass us a fair amount of times, but got no service. We actually had to stop one of them and say we needed to order something. After ordering it was maybe another  minutes or so before we got our drinks. I think there was only one bartender making everything, so Ill let that wait time slide a bit.nnThere were  of us, so we decided to share the drink. It was alright. They pour it out at your table so you can watch it fog up, but it wasnt too extraordinary. Taste wise, it was too sweet for my taste, but what can you expect from a place that sells candy haha. However, the price didnt quite fit the experience.  for a drink its about the size of . normal drinks mind you, but still a bit steep in my opinion.nnOverall, I probably wouldnt go again, but might be worth the experience if youve never got to try."
0,"Oh Youfit, we could have had an amicable break up.nI signed up for a membership while the gym was still in construction and never really got a chance to use my membership as it took awhile for them to open and then I got a job on the other side of town with other gym options. I went in and got a relatively pain free cancellation thanks to the fact that I had been paying for  months and never been in. Oops. I paid any owed fees and filled out all information to cancel. Nice people and cool place, even if it just wasnt for me at the time. I recommended Youfit to others looking for a gym even after canceling my membership. nFast forward to a year later. I received a voice mail from a Youfit representative at this location informing me that I was in collections for unpaid membership dues but that I could easily pay half of what was owed to be able to use my membership. I called them back and was given another pitch about how easy it would be to bring my membership back into good standing. When I could get a word in, I informed her that I had canceled my membership months prior. She looked up my information, realized that I did indeed have a cancellation form in my file, and put me on hold to talk with a manager. When she came back she apologized and assured me that her and the manager would take care of it, that it was completely a mistake on their part, and that it would not reflect negatively on my creditas I wasnt actually in collections. I thought then that it was taken care of. nA week later, I received a text telling me that my monthly membership due did not process and to call a number to fix my account. I have not received any such texts in the entire year since I canceled, I dont know why this would happen now after it was taken care of. I again called this location and asked to speak with a manager, the gentleman I spoke with assured me he would be able to help so I again explained the situation to him. He also admitted that my cancellation was on file and I should not still be charged. But he also said that each months payment since my cancellation in March  has attempted to go through and failed. That is  payments that Youfit has attempted to take out of my account, luckily for me the card they have on file is expired and nothing has actually been charged. Again, he assured me that the manager knows my situation and would take care of it with Youfit corporate. I truly hope that is the case however I wont hold my breath. n nI cant recommend Youfit anymore, billing issues can happen anywhere, but not catching something like this for  months and then not following through to fix a problem is terribly unprofessional. Also, the fact that a manager is not made available and will not personally follow up when there is an issue says a lot about a place."
0,"I was in Red Rock Casino and a bit hungry, so I thought Id get a slice. The server was distracted, and forgot that Id ordered my pizza to go.  I ordered one of the deep dish slices, which was about ..  He put it in the oven for less than a minute so when I got to my car to eat it, it was barely lukewarm.  Besides that, the crust was HARD. I could barely bite into it.  They say that theres no such thing as bad pizza...I beg to differ!"
0,"Man how disappointed I was with quality of food with this Robertos Taco Shop . Generally I love Robertos especially the one closest to my house off Gibson. But I decided to try the one closest by my work which happen to be the Rancho dr one.. nnThis is the second time I have tried the food at this location and was let down twice .. Normally I love the Wednesday taco deal , but the tacos at this location were a big let down . I went during the  lunch hour rush, both times and it seems like they maybe a little under staffed . Because the food I got was cold and I noticed that the had a canister full of pre cooked tacos .. I ignore this, but when  I go to eat my tacos they just fall apart because they are cold and hard .. nnI Know its not easy to keep up with the rush hour for lunch .. But I think the food should be cooked upon ordering .. Not premade food that I received..  nnSorry but twice is enough for me not to return to this location .."
0,"We used to really like the food here so decided to try it again, especially since we found online where kids eat free. There was a little bit of a hassle when we got the check, but ended up getting that removed. However, we were still charged for our kids drinks when the menu specifically said they were included with the meals. The antipasto salad we got was not filled with meats as described, but rather a small portion of only pepperoni and the dressing had an unusual after taste. The alfredo sauce was real bland, chicken parmesan too thin and mainly breading. When we reached out to the manager, never heard a word back so obviously customer service isnt such a priority here. We will never go back."
0,"So where to begin.......My wife and I arrived for dinner at  on a Wednesday night.  The place wasnt that crowded at that time.  Our very nice and pleasant waitress took our orders around .  So by  I began to think it was taking a little long for our food, but I was ok.  By  I thought maybe by fresh that my mussels were literally being fished at that moment. Our food didnt arrive until .  When it did finally come, the mussels were about as dry as can possibly be and my wifes pasta was average at best.  Seeing the disgust in my face, the waitress brought over the manager.  The manager needs to work on his customer relation skills.  When I said that the mussels were dry he looked at them then asked me so theyre dry you say?  He just repeated back everything I said to him.  In a city with so many dining options to choose from, I wouldnt recommend this place to anyone."

0,"Just gone done with a birthday dinner here for my cousin. I will say what we ordered Margherita pizza was very good, but others at our table were disappointed with what they ordered. The mozzarella was some of the best Ive ever had.nnMy issue is with the service. Dinner was at . Our waitress, Victoria, failed to clear plates from the table, had to make it a point that they dont offer free birthday desserts because they get  to  birthdays a night. Thats fine, but Im sure every birthday table is dropping  or more on wine  food and you cant give out a small free birthday dessert?nnThe worst part of the night was waiting FORTYFIVE minutes for her to tally  separate checks for  people. What should have been an enjoyable . half hour dinner turned into a . hour nightmare with some of the worst service Ive ever received. Even the owner was sitting at the bar with a glass of wine on his laptop and ignoring the  birthday tables he had.nnIn fact, getting the check took so long that by the time we left we were hungry again, so we stopped off at Burrito Express  got great service!"
0,"Let me start out by saying their food was decent. I had the sweet and sour chicken and I thought it was pretty good but nothing special. nnThe reason for the  star review is their customer service. The other day I came into Flos with  of my coworkers. We were greeted by a very kind hostess and immediately seated. We sat down and waited all of  seconds before our waiter came over and took our drink orders. He must have run to the kitchen and back because next thing we know, we all have drinks and hes taking our meal orders.nnI bet you are wondering where the problem is....just wait, this is where it gets good. From that point on the waiter never came back to our table. Someone else delivered the food, we had to flag down a different waiter when the entire table was waiting for a refill. Worst of all, I had to chase down our waiter to get our check so that we wouldnt be late getting back to work. I literally had to race after him in heels might I add and I followed him all the way to the kitchen and then grabbed him as soon as he exited.nnIve never been in a situation where I had to ask someone to bring us the check. Usually thats when the waiter is most on top of things. nnFood nService nnWill I come back? I think Ill give them another chance, but this better not be consistent behavior."

0,"I have never been treated worse in my entire life then when I stood outside Robbie Foxs, and I had not even made it through the doors. My friends and I were celebrating a birthday and had A TON of people with us, so my friend and I walk up and ask the bouncers how VIP works and we were shouted at to go to the end of the line. We politely told the bouncer we just wanted to know how VIP worked and he continued to shout go to the end of the line. So she and I walked over to the girl heading the VIP line and asked how it worked and she simply replied it is  dollars a person. As my girlfriend and I walk back to our friends the bouncers point and LAUGH AT US. What the hell!? I wanted to leave immediately but was talked into staying in line.nnThis is where it gets fascinating. I hand my ID over to the bouncer and he asks me how my night goes so I respond sarcastically fantastic! He proceeds to ask me if there is a reason I am being rude to him and I responded that he was rude to me first. He then says well you can leave and tried to hand my ID to the second bouncer. I proceeded to take it out of the bouncers hand and walk away. My boyfriend followed me and I told him Id call the manager in the morning and tell him what had happened, so he offered to go get the guys name. After about  minutes while I am at The Canteen BTW AWESOME bar with great customer service! my bf calls me and wants me to come over. We argue for a bit and then I give in.nnWhen I walk over the bouncer asks me to explain to him what happened. While I was he kept interrupting me and was like NO, YOU need to UNDERSTAND we get asked a lot of stupid questions every night. Wow, so asking how VIP works is stupid hmm? Which, of course, I pointed out to him. Uhm, hi welcome to the service industry, you CHOSE to work this job. All I asked for was the bouncers name, I did not want to go inside and get a free drink I just wanted to know the guys name and he refused to give it to me. Then he accused me of being wasted and not knowing what really happened. That is when I pretty much gave it all up as a lost cause because I had had one vodka sprite.nnI will NEVER return to Robbie Foxs again. EVER. And I tell everyone that if they want horrible service to go here."
0,"I was there the first weekend it was open the food was soso. It was a bit of a turn off when you walked into the front of the restaurant and the management and possible owners were huddled by the front door  not to greet you, but just being tense.nnWe ordered white and red miso soups, which were handed to us backwards which was annoying because we had to listen to a  minute speech on each food option on the menu. I get it, your a new place in town, but I can read. The beef tenderloin with asparagus was good, as was the Kurobuta pork and sweet onion dumplings.nnI cant say the food was any more flavorful than say Cowfish. The front patio was nicely decorated and had a fun atmosphere. I wish they had some music piping through the outdoor seating area."
0,Terrible customer service. Im never going back there. My coworker  I went there for lunch because we had a coupon. It was a buy one get one coupon. We repeatedly asked the waitress if we could use it  about what we could order. She assured us that we could use it. When it came time for the checks we were informed that we couldnt use the coupon because one of us got the special. There wasnt anything stated on the coupon saying that we couldnt do that. We decided to let that slide bc they were going to still take half of one of our meals. Then they came back AGAIN  said they couldnt accept the coupon at all. In the end we had to both pay full price. They were extremely rude  not helpful. I guess they dont want us to come back. They obviously dont care about their customers. Plus the sushi wasnt all that great  we had to wait forever.
0,star just because there is no option for zero.  Took forever and only to get the order wrong at the entire table.  No flavor and just not good at all.  Ive never disliked a pizza ever and this place shut me down.  Way to expensive for any meal let alone bad food.  Was displeased from the start to the end.  It was so bad I just now decided to sign up for yelp just to make this post.  Ill take a  hot and ready before here.  Get Bent
0,"I have seen two different hair stylists over the last two years. They were Chanelle and Patty.  Chanelle does not give you the color you request and when you ask her to correct she pawns you off on another stylist in the salon.  She does not hold her herself accountable for her inability to listen to what the customer wants. Patty listens but talks in hair language and does not realize that the people she does hair for have not been educated on the terminology of hair color.  When she says your hair must be ashy one would assume a grey color , she really means blue.  How one would know this not in the profession, I do not know.   After turning my hair blue, when confronted, she says it was my fault because she told me I would be ashy.  No accountability, and very rude.  For what you pay for this salon, it would be nice to have someone say what can I do to make it right.  They do not know how to do this.  BEWARE!!!!!!!!"

0,"If you have a medical fetish no fu lie then youll love this place. The people here act very superior to everyone else, like as if they have phds in piercings.

0,"stars. Honestly for  lunch buffet on the strip it pretty much met my expectations.nnNone of the food was spectacular, some was better than others. Orange Chicken was pretty good, the taco bar was decent as well. The pizza was pretty meh, but they did have some great desserts. nnWoudnt be my top choice for lunch, though Id consider it for breakfast since I paid more for breakfast at the pyramid cafe for a plate of eggs, hasbrowns and bacon."
0,"I went to Fancy Nails based on all of the great reviews here, but left disappointed.  Based on the other reviews, my experience must be an outlier, but I felt it important to share.  nnI went in for a basic pedicure with nail art, for which I had an appointment.  It appeared they were understaffed, which was the case stated to me later by a woman who appeared to be the owner.  I can understand that that happens.  Initially I wasnt too concerned as I had given myself a reasonable amount of time to enjoy my pedicure, dry, and then get to my next appointment that was nearby.  nnThe assumed owner actually did my pedicure and it was perfect.  She did a great job and was very attentive to calluses and cuticles, which I appreciated.  And the place is very clean, as other reviewers have stated.  After she finished painting my nails, she turned me over to another technician for the artwork and thats where it fell apart.nnWhat I wanted was a fairly simple design. I had another, more intricate, symbol done at another studio without trouble.  The technician looked at the color of my toes bright purple, walked away, and came back with his own palette of  colors white, yellow, and green.  Apparently he had planned to just paint a flower on my nails. ?? He didnt ask me what I wanted nor what colors I might like on the design.  I had to tell him that I wanted a specific design, which I showed him, and rather than have him run around getting new colors I agreed to make the colors he had work.  At this point I was getting nervous about time as I had another appointment to get to.  nnLonger story still long, it was a fiasco.  The brush he had was way too wide for intricate nail art, so the design was a fail.  I said, no problem, thanks for giving it a try.  He grabbed acetone by accident so instead of just removing the design work, all of the polish came off.  I had to remind him of the steps as he put new polish back on.  I ended up running out of there with just a minute to spare to get to my next appt.  I would have been there for hr  min for a basic pedicure with simple nail art.  nnDuring my service, a very unhappy client came up to the woman doing my pedicure with complaints about her manicure.  That same technician had done her manicure.  I think that probably he shouldnt be doing nails.  nnIf you go, be sure to give yourself an extra bumper of time and dont expect to get any nail art.  I made an appointment at Diamond Nails, who had done my art before, to go have them do it for me again this time.  I wont be returning to Fancy Nails."
0,If I could give it ZERO stars I would. DO NOT STAY HERE UNLESS THERE IS NO OTHER OPTION. Rooms are filthy and the managers make you feel slightly uncomfortable. We saw the room and left. Kind of the scene for a thriller movie.
0,This poor baseball field needs a facelift in the worst way. I have been to over  Minor and MLB parks and this is one of the worst I have seen. After Reno getting a new stadium the s should really push the issue on this. The seat are really old meaning half broken and the bleachers type seats need to go. The other issue is that in a city where parking is free everywhere why do you have to pay here? I would much rather use that  elsewhere in the stadium look at Spokane where parking is free.nI do enjoy baseball a lot and would look into season tickets if the stadium made some modifications making the place more comfortable and maybe even some type of shade on the seating.
0,"And now I get to write my very first negative review. Much like with my first review, I thought for a bit about who Id rant about first, and it had to be El Hefe.....so where to begin?nnWhen youre inside the atmosphere and ambience is about as welcoming as Id imagine the inside of one of the breast implants of their servers would be you know, large, inflated, empty, and possibly a little gooey. The one time I went I believe we waited about an hour from asking for our check, waiting for our waitress to figure out how to split it up as we asked, and then royally effing it up in the end anyway yeah, I know that can be annoying, but if arithmetic isnt your strong suit, just tell us  its not your fault that the blood isnt flowing to your brain at the correct speed because it was thwarted at the Hooverlike circulation dam that are your boobs....well actually that is your fault, but still we wont hold it against you. The tacos arent good, the drinks are overpriced, its full of your typical Scottsdale douchebags, whose unfortunate existence ensure that the type of waitresses that populate these types of bars continue to get hired, and its in the middle of a bunch of better options.nnAlso, they should really spell Jefe right."
0,Everything was OKAY not great tho until a server an old woman told me hey! You didnt put tip! Where is tip?? at the door. I actually put  on the table for Sure but somehow they lost it. But that is NOT the point. I dont care if they lost their .  n nI felt uncomfortable that a server ask customer to put tip by compulsion. I told her I put tip on the table. Then she took me to the table and told me but there is no tip! again. Of course I didnt pay another  because I already paid......n I never go this rude restaurant.
0,"This is a great place for shopping if you want trendy, cheap clothes that will be out of style in a few seasons. But for selling, DO NOT GO HERE. I brought over the majority of my closet, which includes Anthropologie, Charlotte Russe, Hollister, etc. And all I was offered was  for three shirts and a pair of flats. One of the shirts was Anthro, so I kept that and the shoes, and sold the other two items for . Ironically, I had tiedyed one of them and they accepted that but not all of my other stuff. The reason behind most of my items being declined was because they were too old, even though the highend items had been purchased within a year, and the rest were basics that would fit any season. In addition, the sales associates threw my clothes on the dirty floor as if they were trash, and then placed my used read dirty shoes on top of them. I was paid  to drive half an hour and back, and watch my great quality stuff be treated like garbage. I understand doing business, but that was plain disrespectful and unnecessary. The ladies who helped me were very nice, but that paled in comparison to the rest of my trip."
0,"I can appreciate a quick tip when I go in for an oil change about a couple things theyd noticed, however the gentleman that performed my smog check I feel crossed the line a bit. He popped my hood, and told me about a cracked motor mount okay, thanks, but then he lays into me about how dangerous and careless Im being about the wear on my brakes.. I was kind of offended. I knew that it was getting to be about to time to change the brake pads, but I know for a fact it wasnt metal on metal like he was saying, while shaking his index finger at me.nnHe gestured for me to come see, and I declined, opting to pay for my smog and get out of that shark tank. nnPROSnCheap smog with coupon in the mail ..nnCONSnIntrusive associates.nLong wait.  minute smog check.nTip cup on the counter..

0,"First glance and this is a very striking place, but after  minutes on the casino floor, the smoke will burn your eyes and give you a headache!  They do have smoke free corridors for walking to and from the elevators, but it is not managed so you walk thru the smoke just to get to your room.  Very difficult for a nonsmoker who is very allergic to smoke!nnThe suite was nice and large, but the bed was uncomfortable, the AC would not cool the room and the air was VERY dry.  The bathroom toilet made a breathing sound when filling and was noisy both in the room and from the room upstairs.nnOur last visit was to the Venetian and the rooms were much better, the beds were more comfortable and the toilet did not breathe.nnThis would not be a place I would try again for the price.

0,Came in today on a whim during my lunch break with a coworker. Place was your average bar an grill with basic food you would expect. They had pretty good lunch and drink specials. I ordered the green pork burrito from the lunch special menu and we got some wings since they were also on special. Wings were average and sauce was clearly store bought but they were juicy and cooked well. The burrito again was good but nothing special. What really held this place back was the service. Our waitress was stone faced and unfriendly. She overcharged us for the burrito and then acted like we were inconveniencing her and didnt even apologize. Im ok with mistakes as things happen but to act that way was ridiculous. I would probably not bother coming here again.
0,"stars for good eggs and bacon. Except that I paid  for eggs and bacon. Semi rude employees that dont speak English. Quinoa salad and all other salads were either stale, dry or simply inedible. Everyone at the table spit out and left their salads untouched. Very few options. The chinese station only offered rice and shrimp dumplings that tasted old and dry and we could not eat more than a bite. The pizza was greasy and lacked any flavor. On par with any fast food pizza.  My friend said the sushi tasted like grocery store sushi dry chewy rice, cheap seaweed, fishy and minimal fish. So at this point pretty much ALL the food was disgusting so we all decided to eat eggs and bacon at pm. They were very good. But I could have gotten good eggs and bacon at any other restaurant for . The desserts were bitter and dry. This place SUCKS"
0,"I want to start out by saying this office has a fantastic way of making you feel welcome. They are very personable and friendly and professional. The entire staff makes you feel like youre welcome and that they are happy to see you. With that being said, they are terrible at followup. I work in a medical field and I know follow up is VERY important to help establish new patients and existing ones. Even an automatic email asking you how the visit went is better than getting absolutely nothing. This makes me feel like once they take your money and your insurances money, theyre done with you. Ive left emails and called several times and no answer nor response. The phone line just kept ringing until I had to hang up and try calling again. Ive tried in different hours in the day because I know how offices can get tied up on phone calls, but still no response, nobody picking up and saying can I put you on hold or anything. I need to get an itemized receipt which they didnt give me at the time of my visit for my FSA. My FSA company keeps calling me for that receipt and its impossible for me to submit anything when I cant get a hold of anybody in the office. This has been a week, and I have my call log to prove that Ive been trying to call them. Once I get my itemized receipt I will not be returning to this office again I have one closer to my place."
0,"This place is way overpriced!! WAY OVERPRICED. To be fair Ive never had a Philly cheesesteak so I had nothing to compare it to in that respect. However, Id rather have had subway over this place anyday. nnEssentially what I did was put all the meat which was sparse into one half of my sandwhich and ate it that way. Granted I dont eat onions so Im sure thats a good space filler for them. I ordered mine with peppers and mushrooms  still stingy with that! Meat was soft and good, not chewy or with grizzle. But no, i wouldnt go back.  for one sub w sparse meatwith no drink or chips nah. I can go to subway and order a double meat with chips and a drink and still get it for less than this place."
0,I tried the coupon from groupon for  for two persons. The food was not that good there tempura was small and the tempura sauce is lacking of taste. The choices is limited in the coupon but it a good saving because the price is a bit high.nnWe went around pm and you can see the chairs are dusty maybe its best to go at night when its dark so you can appreciate the place. Hibachi might be their specialty because the regular food wasnt that good for an expensive price. I like their cold green tea though!

0,My wife and I like eating at eest asian bistro and have been going here for  years. It is slowly going down hill. Food is great but the service has been below par. It is in a horrible spot back in a corner of a strip mall that is half empty of stores. We always eat there around  at night and we have never been there with half of the restaurant full. Service is always slow that I am to the point of only doing carry out. It is a shame because we enjoy the food. Tonight was the last straw. We arrived at the restaurant at  PM and there were only  tables eating. We ordered and the food came out quickly. After we received the food we didnt see our waitress again. All the waitresses were preparing to close for the night. It was  and the sign reads closing time is . Another waitress  came over to fill up drinks when we were almost completed with dinner. We ordered a  to go soup with her. Our original waitress came over with the bill and to clean up plates. The bill did not include the to go soup. The waitresses were at the bar just chatting away and neglecting customers.  We waited patiently for over  minutes for a waitress to return to pick up my card. She came back and I explained that the soup is missing on the bill and that we never received the soup to go. She said that the soup would be out shortly. I asked her that I would like to talk to the manager about the service we received tonight. She said the manager wasnt there and no one with authority was present. I expressed that I was not happy with the service I received and I was disappointed that I received this service with an empty restaurant.  She was very polite about what I told her but this hasnt been the first time. The food is  and a half to  stars. Service is a  star.
0,"Love, love, love the doctors at this practice. I went to this practice until I was  and now that Ive had kids I have brought them here as well. The office is nowhere near our house but it was a place Id be willing to drive to because the doctors are so awesome. Im not sure what has happened but the office staff has become exceptionally rude. I recently had a baby and was told to call back once Ive added him to my insurance and then I was hung up on. Umm ok, he was added to my insurance. Then I called to make an appointment for a sick visit and when I requested to see a doctor and not a NP I was told to be there at a specific time but there would be a wait and Id have to just wait it out. Then I got the snottiest goodbye Ive ever heard in my life and the call disconnected. All loyalty to this practice is lost and I will not be referring any of my friends to this practice. In fact, I will be needing recommendations for a pediatrician in the NW valley..."
0,"Never again, date night at Red Lobster. I should of listened to my family who has told me of the many times they have gotten food poisoning here. We were lucky, no food poisoning however the food was horrible. The only good thing about our night was we were taken right away, our server was nice, and our appetizer was taken off our bill. The food was undercooked, tasted like it was two days old, and we were missing parts of the meal shrimp.  Drinks came at the end of the appetizer and we never got the extra plate we asked for...So far Red Lobster will not be on our list of restaurants to dine at."

0,"Let me start by saying I that I sometimes choose to eat a vegetarian diet.  I sometimes consume meat, but try to keep it to a minimum, strictly because its a healthier way to live  not from any moral considerations.  When I do eat meat I try to avoid, if possible, meat that has been tainted with nitrates, antibiotics, and hormones.  I wish there were more restaurants in Las Vegas that catered specifically to vegans and vegetarians.  Many restaurants offer vegan and vegetarian options, but my Internet search turned up only one restaurant in town that does not serve meat at all  the Go Raw Cafe.nnAfter greatly enjoying a vegetarian Thanksgiving with Tofurkey bought from Whole Foods, I wanted to continue my meatless streak at the Go Raw Cafe.nnThe first thing I noticed was a flyer that had been placed on every table advertising pressure acupuncture.  There was also a bulletin board and counter near the entrance covered with business cards and other flyers.  I wasnt wearing my glasses, but squinting I could make out that one of the flyers was promoting the healing power of crystals.  There was also a book nook that I browsed briefly while waiting for my order to arrive.  One book was all about The Lemonade Diet.  You get the gist.  Why is it that so many naturalhealth food restaurants and markets are in bed with pseudoscience, Eastern culture, and New Age mysticism? nnPerhaps its the health food crowds general mistrust of mainstream culture that results in a gratuitous openness to anything that seems to be a counterculture alternative to the mainstream.  The irony is that whether the pedlar is selling cheese burgers, snake oil, or scientificallyunsound books touting fad diets, the profitmotive remains the same.  It is the stealthy hand of corporate culture that tries to tempt the health food crowd with nonmainstream offerings.  I think there must be marketing research which suggests that health food advocates are susceptible to buying anything that appears to be outside of mainstream culture, as long as it makes attractive claims to improve our physical and spiritual health.  Its pretty insulting, if you ask me.nnBut none of that is a critique of the Go Raw Cafe.  Just an observation.  On to the dining experience.nnOur waiter started by asking my dining partner and me if we had been there before.  When learning that we had not, he provided us with some lukewarm recommendations of a couple of things that he liked all right, and warned us about some other things that he didnt care for, but which some people apparently do like.  It almost seemed as if he were apologizing in advance for the menu.  Seeing as the Smoothies and Veggie Juices were in the range of  to  each, we just ordered a couple of waters with lemon to start with.  The tepid waiter brought our waters in small plastic glasses without ice.  My dining partners lemon wedge was all skin and no pulp. nnWe decided to split the International Sampler and a halforder of the vegicotti.  I was looking forward to the hummus and garlic bread sticks that were part of the International Sampler.  But when our food arrived, I couldnt see or taste any hummus anywhere.  Maybe it was inside of the Mexi Wrap, or mixed in with the Pasta?  As for the garlic bread sticks, there were four of them, stuck upright into the pasta.  They were about the length of a finger with only half the girth.  They were crisp, barely flavored, and gone in six bites.nnThe pasta primavera that came with the vegicotti looked almost identical to the pasta that came with the International Sampler, but there was a very subtle difference in taste.  The taste of the food was unusual, but not unpleasant.  It was interesting, but not exciting.  nnI never had any hesitation or reluctance about eating the food because I knew it was healthy and wholesome.  But I eat healthy, wholesome meals all the time without having to sacrifice good taste and delicious flavors. One can eat healthy and also enjoy it. This food was merely edible.  It didnt taste like shit.  It wasnt repulsive.  But this is not high praise. nnThe menu was also overpriced given the moderate serving portions.  You dont get a lot of food for the price you pay.  Our meal came to , and we had no leftovers. nnThe best I can say about the Go Raw Cafe is that it serves healthy, edible food.  But it is underseasoned and overpriced, and I have no desire to go back there."

0,"They have some nice stuff at ok prices.  Just a few things to remembernn If you order something from their website that is out of stock, they say your card will not be charged until it ships.  This is a lie.  My wife and I ordered a daybed that was out of stock and not due to be shipped for over a week but not to worry because they wouldnt charge us until the thing shipped.  This place pretty much did the opposite by charging us right away for something that wasnt shipped for  weeks.nn Organizing the delivery of an item is a clusterfuk.  You have to deal with  different people who dont care and are each dumber than the last.  Im pretty sure they wait until they have a full truck and delivery route before they will bother they deliver your stuff regardless of what date range they told you."

The waitress took our order shortly after we were seated, great! Then over  minutes later my husband and I got our rolls. Well we were with another couple and we had ordered separately. I know they were aware of this because they had us write our names on the order sheets so they wouldnt get mixed up. So we didnt want to start eating yet since they didnt get their food yet. So we waited. And waited. And waited.  minutes later their rolls came out. By then we had shared our rolls with our friends because we were all starving. So it ended up working out okay. But come on! The place wasnt even packed. There were several empty tables. The weirdest part is that all the servers stand in a little group in the back of the restaurant and just watch everyone. I guess they stand clear of angry people wanting their food. Come on chefs. Step it up!"

I am not sure what the happy hour prices were but lets just say that the martinis were , according to our waitress. I asked what kind of martinis they had and decided on the lemon something or other. My husband ordered the house brew that was recommended by the server.nnWhen the drinks came mine was very yummy. The husband took a nice big drink and thought it was yummy too  not his words, though. After he put the glass down after taking a drink I noticed that there was some things floating in the glass. We were not sure what it was...it looked like just a bunch of debris floating around. He almost lost it. We showed the server and she was very sorry and returned with a new one. I ordered  martinis and he finished his beer and did not feel like having another so we asked for the bill. When I looked on the bill I noticed that the drinks were not the prices that she had stated when we came in and aasked about the specials. The beers was  more than she quoted...and my martinis were not ...they were .. Just at that moment the manger came by and asked how we were doing, I asked about the bill and was told that the happy hour price was for a smaller glass than what my husband had and that only the house martinis were  and mine were not house martinis. nnWhen the husband ordered the beer he asked what is the happy hour special...what do you recommend...and that is what she brought. Same thing about the martinis. I felt schwindled. He adjusted it. Thanks .nnWe did not order any food, but the menu was very pricey. That better be some good eats!!!"
0,"Our family of four stayed at this resort this past Memorial Day weekend. We stayed in a villa room, which was located all the way at the back of the property. The room was a decent size, but I was disappointed that the villa rooms didnt come with a sofabed, just a regular sofa. My two kids ages    ended up just sleeping on some blankets on the floor. I wasnt gonna pay nights for a rollaway bed, since we were there for  nights. I was also disappointed that they didnt provide a microwave and fridge. These are just some of the amenities I thought would be provided, I guess I should have asked prior. Its definitely an older property so dont expect too much.nnOur stay was good overall. The kids enjoyed the pools they have like  pools. Service was good too, with the exception of one of the pool managers. Apparently, we are not allowed to bring fooddrinks in the main pool area, because theres a Cafe Cabana that sells food. We brought some strawberries cuz  its for the children and  they didnt offer strawberries on their menu. We were asked by an employee to bring it back to our room. Later on, a manager walked over and asked how we were enjoying our stay. I told him everythings been great, except we couldnt bring strawberries for our kids to eat. We even ordered well over  worth of food we had a large group of friends, so its not like the resort wasnt making any money on food. He replies, Well go eat them in your room and come back out. Its a RESORT. Are you kidding me?! Is that really the most polite response you can come up with?! nnWould we stay here again? Probably not."
0,"Im not sure if its this location, its management or just the fact that the food really sucks but its gone from a really good place to meet and eat to about the last place you want to choose unless youre really desperate. nnFirst off for a place that features  main menu items, Wings, Pizza and Calzones, all of them are horrible! nnThe wings are small, not breaded, usually have a bit of an aftertaste from old grease and for some reason you wait for  minutes for an order, these should be ready to go at all times! Its a staple on the menu! I always order my wings plain with sauce on the side, all their sauces seem to have broken down and are now pretty much just a layer of butter with color... not very appetizing at all!nnOn to the pizza, for some reason always burnt! Ive ordered it on  different occasions and finally gave up after giving them the benefit of the doubt, thin crust, almost paper thin, an OK sauce but when you can order it and say, Id rather have gone to Pizza Hut you know there is a problem.nnNow the Calzones, totally in the other direction, these on  occasions have in each event been fully undercooked! Its as if the kitchen doesnt understand how to time orders so they put everything in at the same time and take it all out at the same time, sadly this doesnt work! Pizza and Calzone have different cooking times!!! They dont understand that and Ive given up on the place. nnMy last visit there was for Monday Night Football and for a sports themed bar, they had  customers in the entire place and  were off duty employees! To me if you cant get people in your place on Monday Night Football with a menu and bar geared to that crowd, you need to revamp and rethink what youre doing because its not working! nnMy last outing there, several customers were talking about going Buffalo Wild Wings now that it reopened, Native made it too easy for people to make that decision! nnSorry guys call me when you figure it out!"
0,"Ive bought  sets of clubs from James at Custom Golf Center in Tempe, AZ  and one for my wife.   With the second purchase we had several issues with customer service James didnt return calls or emails but after a long ordeal we loved the clubs.   These clubs were stolen out of the trunk of our car  and have tried to reorder the same clubs from Custom Golf Center but after over  weeks of calls and emails......

0,"I have taken a few dates here, usually they are pretty good about taking reservations. However, they tend to have someone pick up the phone who barely speaks english, which is a bit of a hassle.nnThe place is fun, vibrant, chill atmosphere. It is on the expensive side. I have not had a single one of their tapas that I thought were so good, that you should order them. I do like one of their soups, the one with basil and is a bit spicy. Other than that, I cant recommned a single thing. nnOh and both dates were crappy... and I rock on dates, so I know it was Silk Elephant that screwed me over, and then screwed me over again by charging me so much for such mediocre food."
0,"Selection of furniture is awful, the store smells so bad, old junk.... Big store but full of low end pieces, there are way better consignment stores in Scottsdale, I would be surprised if this one stays open very long."
0,"and a half stars.nnPreviosly i would have given this place  or  stars because it is authentic greasy mexican food that was always pretty decent.nnHowever the other day me and my roomate went here for lunch and both got food poisioning.nnSo Ill  leave you with this caveat, eating at taqueria guadalajara is like rolling a pair of dice.  It might come up good and you get some alright mexican food or you might crap out and get food poisioning.nnI definately wont be eating here again but once again that is due pretty much entirely to getting food poisioning which was lame."
0,My son and I entered this establishment on August the th  around  p.m. We stood in the doorway waiting for someone to come to take our order for roughly  minutes. I proceeded to find someone back in the kitchen who rudely looked by me and called out for the hostess.  The hostess came and took my order and could not answer any of my questions regarding the menu.  At this time there was only one family dining in the establishment.nnI ordered a turkey dinner and the barbecue brisket. The mashed potatoes that accompanied the turkey dinner was very hard with no seasoning the stuffing as well . The hostess told me the macaroni and cheese was great and made from scratch. I found the macaroni and cheese to be right out of the box..  The brisket was average in the string beans were okay. I asked where we going to receive a corn muffin or a form of a bread and she said no that they failed to make the fresh bread  that morning.  All in all this was one of the worst experiences I have had with a diner on the west side.
0,I ordered an Old West hamburger.  The hamburger was good but the onion rings and fries tasted as if they were cooked in old grease  I ate a few but couldnt stand the taste.  Later that evening I got sick from eating the few fries.  It is disappointing that Toby Keith has a restaurant that serves such terrible food that people are getting sick.  Not good!!!!!!
0,Terrible.nnNot much else to say. Wife picked up a  assortment of everything they had and it was truly the only time BBQ has ever been THROWN AWAY at this house. Literally the worst BBQ we have ever tried and we eat a lot. Everything tasted dehydrated in a large way.nnPass.
0,"A big FU to the waitress last night at the Carolina Ale House in Downtown Charlotte.  First, my two beer glasses were filthy. No apology, no acceptance of responsibility.  Second, we ordered wings and we were never asked if we wanted ranch or blue cheese, a very typical side item.  You also failed to provide plates for the bones.  Third, when I ordered a simple cheese burger, I told the waitress exactly what I wanted. She came back with all of those specific items missing and asked if there was anything else I would like.  I politely responded by mentioning those items and she said she would be right back, so I waited.   minutes later, my burger is too cold to enjoy.  When she caught my eye, she said she remembered and will go get those items.  I said, never mind, just take my food and bring me the check, Im done here.  nnHowever, I still felt obligated to tip.  Because, if I didnt tip, Im sure she would have walked away and said there goes another nigger that does not tip.  And, I was not going to give her the satisfaction.  Besides, the bus boy and bartender did nothing wrong to lose my support.  So, she benefits because of them.  So, I gave the lowest amount I have in many years, .  But, this waitress was fn lousy.  Her name is Heather M according to my sales receipt, so avoid her.  Im sure the establishment is fine."
0,"It would take a lot of mojitos and sangria to get me back to Havana Cafe anytime soon. Is the food bad? No. But Cuban food is a bit bland on my taste buds next to other foreign cuisines The San Juan Platter I had was kind of plain, and only a garlic sauce gave some of the items any taste at all. The pollo cubano was pretty much chicken soaked in lime juice and buried in sauteed onions. nnBut those mojitos and sangria are definitely tasty, and the waiting staff is excellent. It seemed, though, a woman I guess was the owner thought a Saturday night would be a great time to conduct a rather loud discussion about marketing and operations for Havana Cafe. That sliced into the already dull atmosphere. nnAnother complaint Why does Havana Cafe feel the need to take up its entire front parking lot with valet parking? Im neither too lazy to walk, not do I enjoy having strangers drive my vehicle. For a parking lot so small in a climate so mild, valet parking is just stupid. nnReally, if I want a fairly fancy Latinflavored meal, Ill just head over to Asi es la Vida or Mucho Gusto Taqueria. Both restaurants are a lot more inventive, interesting and memorable."
0,"Okay, to be fair, the twostar rating is based on a single visit to The Turf no longer Turf Accountant, because that made no damn sense anyway. If it had been a better night, I would have given three, maybe even four stars. nnThe food was okay better than average bar food, not as good as a restaurant thats really trying. We got a boxty, which was just a pile of veggies in white gravy under a potato pancake thing kind of tasty, but weird. The salad wasnt bad. The chicken strips were average at best. The beer was good, the atmosphere was exactly what an Irish bar should be, the band was REALLY good.nnHowever.nnWe got their around  on First Friday. It wasnt as busy as Id feared we were seated right away, placed our order. Then we waited. For almost an hour. I saw food coming out at a steady pace from the kitchen I assumed they were just backed up from the First Friday crowd.nnOur waiter came around to check on us again, and I finally mentioned that we were getting awfully hungry.  His response, and I swear to God Im not making this up  Oh, did you order food?nnI blinked at him, and focused on not killing him with my pint glass. Through clenched teeth I said slowly, Yes. We did. A lot of it. nnHe ran back to the register and put our order in, and our food came out within minutes. I dont know what brain surgery procedure he was prematurely released from, but HOW THE HELL DO YOU FORGET TO PUT IN AN ORDER FOR AN ENTIRE TABLE? nnYes, it was only one mistake, by one person and not the entire restaurant, but it was a pretty fucking huge mistake. If the rest of the experience had been much over average, I might go back. But it wasnt. So I wont."
0,"....nnThat was the total of my cape cod. A weak one at that!!! Seriously, .? Heather and I looked at each other in bewilderment because in the first place the server said it would be only  but she comes back and tells me its that price. Ok now I dont mind paying that much for a drink, but what I did mind was the fact that they take your drink order and then tell you they need cash or a card BEFORE bringing you the drink. I sent her off with a  bill since she said it was only  so when she came back she gave me the total and said dont worry about the change... I was like ok? Dont worry about a tip either toots!! nnWe came here and it was supposed to be free for locals, of course the sign on the door said before pm and guess what Sally? It was ! Oh well, that gave us a free well drink ticket which was a crappy cape cod. I swear, I understand that top shelf is more but it was pure juice imo! Whatevs! We walked around this joint and I was all happy with the lights. The only seating they have is sround the bar which is also were they have game consoles. They have vip tables or whatever which include a nice place to sit and a personal tv and all the regular crap vip has.nnI seen they had a ton of really awesome games but I didnt play any   I wasnt about to spill any of my  cranberry juice! Lol. Back to my drink. Ok, so HeathEr comes back with a big plastic cup and my server comes back with a small glass im used to them being served in a collins or high ball... And NO LIME!! Ok, now I guess some bartenders dont know how to make this very complicated drink called a cape codder. nnThis place is cool if you dont mind over paying for drinks come on, I always go to clubs on the strip,  for a drink there is acceptable but not at this place! I may give it another shot since they have awesome hip hop acts wanted to see Kweli! So yea."
0,I have been ordering from King Wok for over a year now. The food very good however the service is TERRIBLE. I swear they NEVER get my order right for take out or delivery. Ive given them a year to fix their crappy service so I wont be ordering from them anymore.
0,"I wish we would have gotten in to give a true review but how good can it be when the doormen think theyre working the door of Marquee or something.....  Too soon??nnI know the drill bring more girls than dudes, make sure theyre hot, be patient, dont act like a douche.  Check.  Still nothing, they said they were sold out and when we turned around to leave they said, just to the guys well lets talk about this.., code for give me some money.   I get the whole greasethedoorguyor waitinline thing but after they turned down  for the whole group we left.  Something about some celebrity Ive never heard of being in there.  They need to remember that some aspect of their job is hospitality."
0,"I want to like this place as it is so close to my house, but their food quality is too hit and miss. This time the pizza was okay, but the bacon ranch fries have apparently changed since the last several times we ordered them. It was obvious one of the cheeses they put on the fries was like Kraft singles and it was disgusting in combination with the other ingredients. We couldnt even eat it.Whenever I eat in the restaurant the wait staff is usually quite poor. They dont come to your table often enough which leaves you unable to eat without having a drink to help wash it down.nnOverall, just poor attention to detail in quality of service and food quality."
0,"I was at Daddy Macs last night for a zombie show viewing. I had a blast... until Daddy Macs booted us out of the event in order to facilitate another one. Not only did they show up before TWD was over, but they treated us and other PAYING patrons very very poorly, and made every single person leave. People that were still drinking, that were still eating, were forced out of the venue. They had a lot of technical issues with their big screens not working, and the service was terrible. Its a shame, I had been there just the week before, and had the time of my life. I easily foresaw that as being my new hang out spot every Sunday night. Not anymore. Terrible business practices, they should be ashamed of themselves."
0,"Come on now, advertised as all you can eat, then they hit you up for  for dessert. What a rip.  The meat was overcooked, and the salad bar wasnt as good as they advertised. Total disappointment.  Service was excellent."
0,Jonathon the manager who was early s at best had a real attitude.  Lied to us on check in about our room.  Even called security although we were calm and he wasnt.  Hmm. nNot ever would we come back.
0,"NOT A FAN.  I only refrained from giving onestar because the Ahi Tuna is probably one of the prettiest dishes Ive seen take a look at my pic NOW hahannLuckily I didnt go in super high expectations, but I cant imagine this standing up to many of the other restaurants within  feet walking distance.  We ordered the Crusted Ahi Tuna and the Pecan Crusted Redfish.  Appearance was awesome!  The Ahi Tunas taste was alright, and I just didnt enjoy the Redfish.  I understand that tastestypes of food differ and this many not have been the spot for me, but my complaints come from the service.nnProblem number one is that we had two waiters through the night, which is already confusing.  Maybe they got their game plan confused  They each asked us how we were doing once during dinner.  They asked within a minute of each other, immediately after we received food and before we started eating.  Awesome.nnProblem number two is possibly related to how young I look or maybe Im looking into it too much.  The waiter dropped off the menu when he seated us.  After our meal he didnt ask if we wanted dessert and dropped off our check.  Now, this normally wouldnt bother me too much.  I started getting pissed when our same waiter the one that gave us our menu seated an older couple right next to us.  He proceeded to give a detailed explanation of their specialty dishes, recommendations, as well as explaining the option of a pricey prixfixe tasting menu.  Im not saying I would have ordered differently if I did get the speel, but still....give it regardless!  Also, I was peeking around at all the desserts passing by drool...but not like we had the opportunity to order anyways.nnI felt pretty neglected we all just need some love right? especially for a restaurant that wasnt even halffull.  Its one of the only instances that Ive walked out and complained directly to the host.  He seemed very sincere which was nice...but didnt offer for us to give them another chance, if you know what i mean"
0,We went for labor day weekend and I would have to say that it is not worth the wait which was mins or the price  per person. The dessert section was one of the better ones however it does not make up for the par food selection. Nothing stood out taste wise. I do not believe I would be back.
0,"I was in Hangar Cafe with my kids and had breakfast, and there was a waitress with blonde hair and a lot of makeup, I think her name was Stacey, and I just want to say that even my kids noticed that she smelled very strongly of cigarettes, and theyre only four and six. I think this is very unprofessional of your establishment to allow servers to smoke during their shifts."
0,I stayed in this hotel for Super Bowl Sunday my friend booked the room and got a great deal well now I know why he got a great deal the room sucked was a dirty room the first night we got their we get or stuff stolen I made a complaint and till this day I havent heard from them I dont recommend it at all its not worth it ... They will reel u in to stay then robe u while your out ..

0,"Went on Sunday,  football games on TV. One being a Arizona cardinals game.nPlace was half full....why? The food was terrible.

0,Long wait for service.  Less then mediocre food. Salmon was dry and overcooked. Bar tenders dont know the difference between ginger ale and ginger beer. This location is too good for this caliber of a restaurant. Not sure how it has standed the test of time. Maybe im missing something but ive gone twice with the same results.
0,"Worst. service. ever.nWe were the only table  people out of the ENTIRE floor, and yet the  waiters there seemed to have better things to do than to serve us water or bread while waiting almost  hours for our mediocre food. We actually had to go grab random water pitchers and bread baskets from other empty tables  it was THAT bad. And the food? Soooo bleh. Not worth the price tag AT ALL. Stay away, tourists. Montreal has so much better to offer  going there will make you think we have no idea how to run a restaurant."
0,I went to this Mall with some expectation but I was disappointed. It seems its in a bad neighborhood and its not very attractive mall to do shopping. I just bought what I want at Bath and Body Works and left. I went to Burlington but this store is almost like Goodwill. Eww!!
0,"I dont like this place! I only go here when my friends pick this place for a quick lunch get together. Food is just okay, not that great. Service is usually horrible and it sucks when you go w a party of more then  because they automatically add a  gratitude on your bill and thats probably the reason why they give such horrible service while youre there. The service is definitely disappointing. I had pho here and they told me they were out of bean sprouts. The waiter brought me shredded cabbage as a substitute. I also purchase bubble tea here and they told me they had no bubble left. My bubble tea tasted like a milk shake! If you want good quality Vietnamese food go to Saigon Palace! You will not regret it.nnOverall, I would only go here because its clean and in a good area and maybe because it was close by. But definitely would not go here if I had a choice!"
0,"Horrible customer service!!!! So my wife went their to get us some dinner. The reason I am writing this is because this is the th time that this taco bell has screwed us at the to go window.

I just wish someone will read this and realize that this taco bell is full of incompetent lazy workers"
0,"This food court is really sad, though I appreciate the fact they have a diverse range of food to pick from.

Maybe she was taught backwards. Arent women supposed to be first? Well Missy....get some manners.. If you are working in the field of serving me... get educated... Some people really should apply at a prison or something. I do not like attitudes. So... yes... Smile and serve me. Im paying to eat. That includes good service.

0,"I am sorry circus circus, you used to be my favorite place. I have nothing against this place, I love the midway arcade BUT, I really dislike the workers behind the carnival game stands. It looked like they were mad at me or something, I didnt even do anything!! I am not joking my brother played basketball a few times and got one in  a hoop and the guys face was expressionless and looked a little mean,and just threw the bear at him. Same with the lady at the water gun shooting game, only me and my brother were playing and I beat my brother and she just gave me a bear, not enthusiastic or anything. Their expressions gives me the creeps. I think if I come back I might just stick to the games with the tickets...nI suggest you not play the claw machines I must have wasted  dollars and got nothing, spend your money on getting tickets its much better! nI think im started to like excaliburs fantasy faire more now, even though its smaller than circus circus, at least the workers are friendlier.nThe free circus acts were nice to watch.nI saw two acts, one with two guys doing gymnastic stuff, and some guy in the air with strings, he was shirtless..so thats a plus!"

0,They were very friendly on the phone but once they came out they didnt fix the problem. Sink was clogged and they snaked the lines but it cost  including the service fee and we had to call another plumber out  weeks later. Skip this company and go for a smaller family owned option. This company also doesnt offer a service guarantee.
0,"Went to this place last night with a party of . Told the waitress at the very beginning that we would need separate checks. Food very average I thought. Service was not good at all. One person had to send his carnitas tacos back two times and decided he had lost his appetite. After asking for our check so we could leave, it took  minutes to get our checks which two were not correct. When we received our checks, they had the nerve to automatically add  tip. This waitress did NOT deserve a  tip. I have never seen anything more than  added and I think that is very high as well. It is not required by law to leave any certain amount of a tip so how is it that they can get away with adding an automatic . Very disappointing and I will never go back. Food  not good. Service  terrible. Automatic  to someone who didnt deserve it  BULLSHIT!"
0,When the ratio to wait staff to diners is  youd think you could get service!!!nnNothing erks me more then seeing idol wait staff and hungry patrons. I very rarely walk out of a restaurant with out having eaten first. I came here on Saturday ay pm. Almost none of the diners had food on their table and many of them didnt have drinks in the  minutes I was there I counted  waitress again I counted  waitresses and not a one of them came over to our table to get even a drink order. Just from the looks of it I could tell staying any longer would be a total train wreck. So after  minutes of waitress counting we left with empty bellies.

0,"When you walk inside the Golden Nugget, you would completely forget that youre actually on Fremont Street in Downtown Vegas and its because they really try and keep up with the casinos on The Strip. However, the main reason I go downtown is to look for a  BJ table, and the Golden Nugget fails to deliver on that. Because they are trying to keep their status as the nicest hotel and casino on Fremont, that also means their table limits are higher, almost comparable to places like MGM Grand and the Mandalay Bay, but not as high as the Wynn and Bellagio.nnSo...theres no way Ill ever want to stay downtown, and Golden Nugget doesnt seem to fit my bill of cheap, degenerate gambling, I probably wont be coming back to stay or play. But check out that giant gold nugget they have in the hotel if youre passing through."
0,Had an out of town guest from Chicago that wanted to try this so off we went.  Shared parking lot with another restaurant and the place was not too crowded at lunch.  The presentation within the former diner was nice and the staff seemed helpful and pleasant for a fast food joint.  The problem was my friend said the sandwich was no where near a true Italian beef like they have in Chicago.  I asked how it was supposed to taste but he couldnt describe it.nnI personally just didnt like the flavor.  It was slightly smokey but not in a good way like BBQ.  Hard to describe but just felt like it could use a different taste.  Otherwise the meet was tender.nnMaybe if I every were to go back Ill try the cheese fries that everyone else with higher reviews is showing.
0,"THIS IS A REVIEW FOR THE LUNCH BUFFET.  I HAVE NOT BEEN THERE FOR DINNERnnWow, I was a little surprised.   I had heard so many good things.  Perhaps this was just an off day for their lunch buffet.nnLet me explain that we were not treated badly, we were just ignored for the most part.  I tried almost everything on the buffet and I enjoy eating Indian food and was looking forward to lunch here since the day before since I had never been.nnThat said... nnI have been to several different Indian places here in town and after reading other reviews I didnt know exactly what to expect.nnThe service was barely there and the lunch buffet about an hour and a half into service was messy.  The steam table was occasionally being refilled instead of changed out.  At least, theoretically, the food that was there at the beginning would only last till the end of the lunch hours. There were a few other cleanliness issues but Ill leave it at that.  nnThe tap water served in the cloudy glass could not be overlooked. nnThe items on the lunch buffet itself, some overcooked, were just okay at best.  Other items bear only slight resemblance to the preparations Ive had at other Indian places.  I really do enjoy Indian food and I really went into this WANTING to like this place.   nnThere are a lot of Indian lunch buffets in Las Vegas and if you have the means to go to a different one... sigh ...go."
0,"Javier the server was really rude with an attitude. Have you got my order wrong and blamed me for his mistake. Javier got loud in the restaurant and wanted to argue about the mistake. Javier gave me a menu then he left. The gentleman brought me chips and salsa and I was almost through before I called Javier for help . Javier seemed preoccupied with the cooks, I understand Spanish perfectly and he talked about me as if I did the order wrong .. He knew he was wrong he tried to offer me chips . He did not even want exchange my order. Needless to say I will not be returning to this restaurant. Half of the servers are sitting there eating their food looking at you drinking having a good time while youre waiting to be served . I waited and I just left. After I told the cashier she acted like she didnt even care its not the area its the people in the restaurant that are not professional or have an understanding of English unless you speak very very slow . Again I will not go to this restaurant ever you cannot pay me to go to this restaurant because the staff are so rude."
0,"Les  Brasseurs is a pretty average restaurant.  The foods alright, the service is alright, the beers alright, the atmosphere is alright as long as you dont mind the really loud volume.  Its too expensive and wellknown for what it is, but I wouldnt call it bad."
0,"When I went to the wicked spoon it wasnt that great actually when I walked out of the bathroom I slipped in vomit in was gross but of course no one was there to inform that vomit was there. after we talked to the manager they gave me  gift card to buy new clothes, comp room, payed for the meal, and let me take a shower in one of the rooms."
0,"Dirty rooms, rude staff, adolescent patrons.  Made the mistake of staying here for the night cause closer to airport and everything else was booked should have been my first warning.  Looked out window  nice muddy view of pool and I think MGM  could not be sure need to wash windows.  Beds were lumpy and we tried to keep everything off floor  just nasty.  When we got home, everything went right into the washer from garage we were scared of bed bugs  roaches getting into our home.  Since we were staying of one night and were not big players  staff was apathetic at best.  We got in kinda late and didnt want to fight with traffic  so ate at the  Hooters in the casino  will write separate review but in one word  HORRID!. To add to the fun place was full to brim with really drunk  year olds.  They are loud, obnoxious and actually dangerous  we saw one pushing match and didnt feel safe they were serving people that were so drunk they could hardly sit on the chair but as long as they put the bets down the drinks flowed.  Where was the casino security ?   Stay away, should have just gone to airport and sleep in terminal  would have been better."
0,"Ordered lasagna and a chicken Caesar salad.  A pizza came to my friend and we had to tell the waitress that was not what we ordered.  A minute later the lasagna arrived, definitely was microwaved.  Then my friend had to wait  minutes for the salad.  Service is pretty awful, food is bland, go to Oregenos in old town for better pizza!"
0,"I was surprised that there was no line and on entering there were very few diners. It soon became apparent why there were only a few dishes offering anything close to eye appeal.  I dont mind sacrificing a little quality for variety, but this buffet included canned corn and peascarrots.  I stopped whining long enough to eat a salad with bottled blue cheese dressing, overdone mahi mahi, one bite out of a dried out BBQ pork rib, slices of overdone pork loin, a chocolate covered strawberry and a tasteless Napoleon."
0,I am extremely disappointed in service Ive received here lately. There are new people all the time and you never see them clean tools. Then today they changed the price on me after I asked when I arrived. SO NOT cool. I will not go back ever again!
0,"Well I do want to say the service was very attentive and good. However the food was so bad. First the chips and salsa and bean dip was horrible. All  elements just bad. The meal I had was the quesadilla and my date had a burrito. We both ate half and agreed that while it had a good presentation, it lacked flavor and was blah. The drinks were really bad too, she had a white Sangria and I had a red both very very weak and were more like a wine spritzer. The red especially should not be clear like cranberry juice. The place itself is not presented well for a restaurant and truly feels it is a club with tables. The menu is also very limited and they should have some sort of drink menu if it is also a tequila bar? So, too bad maybe I will try again if I start seeing better reviews and another Groupon available."
0,"Rental department is struggling. nI had the displeasure of attempting to rent a sander at the Home Depot. Jerry, the manager of the rental department, tried three different ways to increase the cost of the rental by charging for accessories that other stores include with the rental. nThe long list of disclosures that each customer is required to sign off on makes renting from Home Depot feel like theres a lot of distrust and leaves the feeling that shopping here should be avoided"
0,"We decided to eat at The Florida Cafe because it was in our hotel. It took a while for us to get seated. The waitresses seemed off in their own world most of the time. We waited about  minutes before we even got our servers attention that we wanted to order. I thought the food was okay, but my husband loved what he got. When we needed refills, our waitress was nowhere to be found."
0,"Where to begin I dont think Ill be back anytime soon. The server was very cute and young, but didnt listen to anything we asked for. Wanted salads first, they came at the same time as everything else. Wanted full sandwiches, got halves. Asked if the onion rings were better than the fries?  She said they were  but they were not. After the rush was over, I noticed a bunch of older men emerge from the back of the house to catch the scores from the nights sports slate. Seems like the managers only sit at the bar or mill around the kitchen flirting with the very young allfemale waitstaff. So if you like soso service and mediocre food while watching a bizarre display of small, blurry outofposition TVs and a staff with very little supervision, then this is the place for you. A shame too because this place has potential."
0,"Ordered two nights ago. The male who took my delivery order stole my debit card info. Luckily my bank blocked the  charge at some merchant in Indiana.nnI have a theory. If the guy who took my order was also the delivery driver. He may have been upset with a  tip when it was raining. When I wrote the tip, he was mentioning something about it. but the rain and his accent I couldnt understand him but I pretended I did.nnnI had the intention of a  cash tip, brain fart and routine kicked in. The food was delivered, but it was tossed aside. nnnThere is a review from , her info was stolen too."
0,The tacos cost . each and I tried the fish tacos.  I enjoyed the fish tacos at Del Taco better than these.  The wooden chairs were uncomfortable and there were lots of flies flying around.  Gross.  I wont be back.
0,Used to come under previous ownership and wanted to try again... What a disappointment. We walked in at  till  and were told that they closed at . We were treated like an inconvenience. The band was entertaining but service was unfriendly. The only reason Im giving  stars in because I liked the wine selection.
0,"My mother used to eat here all of the time until her medical emergency. This place is pretty much a below average Chinese buffet. I wasnt too impressed with the selection and the quality was definitely subpar,nnThe factsnnProsnn.  Easy to find off of th Street in Phoenix. It obviously used to be some sort of fast food place.nn.  Plenty of parking in general.nn.  The dinner buffet was . which is cheap considering what other buffets might charge.nn.  The selection is pretty decent but very heavy on chicken oriented dishes.nnConsnn.  A little too salty on most of its food. As I stated, they are very heavy on chicken oriented dishes.nn.  I just dont think jello belongs in a buffet. Its a cheap option to maximize profit. Not very impressed by red and green jello.nn.  The egg rolls were pretty bad. Yes they were crunchy on the outside but felt undercooked on the inside. That means soggy, which isnt a good thing.nnThis would be a good choice after a drunken stupor evening when it doesnt matter what you put in your stomach. As for a choice, I would most likely avoid this place."
0,"The two stars are for the food. The food was great. If i were to rate only service it would be one or zero. I went here with my girlfriend and her sister. Excited to see a new sushi restaurant in the old spot of one of my favorite sushi restaurants, Mikado. I was impressed with the selection of sushi. So we placed our orders, the girls dont like seaweed so they ordered theirs on soy paper. When it was brought to us only her sisters was on soy paper. Ours was not. When we told the waiter he just stared at us until we asked if they could remake them. I hated to ask, but my gf wouldnt eat the seaweed, and it is what we asked for. He then acted as if it was our fault, that we hadnt asked for it, even though we repeatedly told him that specific of our order. Following this we dealt with only the manager and only saw the waiter again for our bill. We ordered dessert from the manager who seemed confused on one of the orders even though we named it word for word. We clarified to be sure. When it arrived it was the wrong flavor of ice cream. Not wanting to be anymore of a hassle for them we kept our mouths closed about it. Following this we probably waited  minutes to ask for our check and to then pay. We ended up leaving without leaving a tip. I never do this. But we had no service and when we did something got messed up with little to no apology. I will most likely go back to give it a second chance. Maybe then I will update this review."
0,"The menu is great, the same as N. Mesa location, decore and site is great however service is lousy every time we go, napkins are too cheap and small as well. The manager seems to have dinner with his family right out in the bar when they are slammed... Most of the staff seem to be inexperienced high school kids... we have since stopped going because of this even though we live less than a mile away. Seems like a training and hiring issue..."
0,"FUCK THIS PLACE! This was our order Shrimp  Snow Peas, Egg Plant  Tofu and Chow Mein.  The chow mein was really greasyoily and so was the stir fry eggplant  tofu which came out sitting in oil.  The shrimp  snow peas had a hair in it. After finding the strand of hair a couple of bites into our meal, the cashier  server both males decided to clean out the trash bin. Some of the trash had spilled out  one of them picked it up barehanded. After dealing with the trash both of these two morons didnt even wash their hands. They went right back to taking orders and sending out food. That was the sign for us to bail. I left disappointed, but also humored at how the employees still think theyre in their rd world country. Never again..."
0,"I like Sprouts, its just this location is a bit hit or miss. It was the same way when it was Sunflower Market to be honest and I notice a lot of the same employees still work there. Just a lot of little stuff Ive noticed since I started going back there like long lines, not being greeted by cashiers, employees stocking shelves making no motion to budge, etc. Dont get me wrong, some of the employees are friendly, but a lot just seem miserable. To highlight my point I shouldve taken a picture of the exact same sandwich I got from the deli at the Ray location vs the Tempe location and I think that would underscore the lack of a attention to detail.nnUpdate Downgraded to a  for some of the stuff Ive gone through the last couple of times Ive been there."
0,"When will we learn? We came in here tired and starving after half a day of walking down the strip. We were seduced by the all day  specials, but really the warning signs were there.nnwe started off ordering the  margaritas which quenched the thirst, but were all syrup and next to no alcohol no real surprise. We followed that up with a taco salad and queso fundido. We got full quick, but neither were very appetizing. The biggest sin of the meal, though, was that they served chili with the taco salad rather than pinto or refried beans.nnOverall, for Las Vegas, this joint is cheap, but you have so many other options you might as well spend a little more and enjoy your meal."
0,"Everyone here is complaining about this place not being the old Saltys. I wouldnt even mind that as much as I loved the old Saltys. The problem is that the its a taco place without any Taco Tuesday special, the prices are  or more a taco and the service is not the best. Not to mention the salsa isnt good either. Too many strikes on a taco joint.nnThey bring out all of the tacos on paddles and you have to sort it out yourself. Bad situation when youve got  people at a table and they dont even get all the tacos. The patio is nice and the food is good but honestly its just not worth it when it comes to price and service. In Arizona there are much better options. I hope I dont find myself here anytime soon. Do yourself a favor and dont waste your time."
0,"Ri Ra is one of the coolest bars in Charlotte from a decorambiance perspective. After work its loud and crowded and energetic  exactly as it should be. nnWhat I really wish is that the kitchen staff were able to produce quality food to go along with that ambiance. I ordered one of my favorite comfort food dishes  cottage pie. What I was served was sparse ground beef, frozen mixed vegetables thrown in an overly salty sauce topped with processed whipped potatoes. I know they were frozen mixed vegetables because I really dont think corn is typically used in cottage pie... Its just not that hard to make cottage pie or shepherds pie with lamb even in a restaurant environment. nnStick with a Jamesons or Guinness after work and move elsewhere for dinner."
0,"On the the upside, this restaurant has beautiful views and some interesting architecture I like the ceiling a lot.  Unfortunately, probably because of the large open area and high ceiling, it does tend to get incredibly noisy when busy, and might be better for a small group, or preferably just two people, so that you can hear each other.  I was here for a friends birthday, and there were eight of us.  It was difficult to chat with the people on the far side of the table without a lot of shouting.nnWe came here on a Wednesday during restaurant week.  Although the waitress was polite, the service was incredibly slow, especially for a Wednesday!  I believe we were there for  minutes before our food order was even taken. For restaurant week, you choose a salad I got the T.O.R House Salad, entree I chose the Composition of Local Farmers Vegetables and a desert.  Im a vegetarian so that was really my only option for an entree.  The salad was good, especially the beets.  The entree was PATHETIC! Firstly, it was just a few really only a few basic small roasted vegetables, and a tiny bit of rice.  Something I could easily do at home much better.  Considering the high price, I would have expected some effort made in terms of interesting or expensive ingredients, and preferably some kind of protein.  The portion was tiny!  It was smaller than I would expect for a one person appetizer, never mind a main entree.  It was frustrating that everyone else was complaining that they almost had too much food, but despite being a very small female, I was not at all satiated.  Just because Im a vegetarian, it does not mean Im attempting to starve myself with small carrots, I still want to eat!!  Hopefully they will read this review, and do something to improve their vegetarian entree option, as it really is a beautiful spot.  My cocktail was tasty, no complaints there."
0,"It began two years ago. We signed a lease, and were so badly misquoted, I had to pay  an additional  in fees the first month. Then, we were told we could not hang sun blockers on our patio, the heat in the single pain windows required us to buy special curtains, to keep the  bedroom apartment a scalding  degrees for almost . per month in cooling bills. The pool turned into a bathtub for the children, often having an off yellow color and high crime indicators of loitering individuals became prevelent. Now, after scrubbing down the apartment, paying to steam clean the carpets and paying numerous deposits, I am sent a bill, dated midDecember, received today midJanuary and told if I fail to pay . in  days I will recieve action on my acccount. BBB....here I come!"
0,"I wasnt too impressed by  Amigos  the servers were uninterested and lacked politeness and friendliness. The food was typical generic Mexican my burrito was fine, but it lacked flavour and was quite bland.nnIts a pity my trip to Montreal ended with a meal here  there are much better places around."
0,Came in here late after the bar ordered some breakfast and some hamburgers because you can get them both at this location it took us  minute wait before we got it it was crazy ridiculous. Called the corporate office they said they would take care of the problem Scott in a little bit better but not hundred percent.
0,"I have been noticeably quiet of late. It seems I have been dining at all good restaurants with good service and have become rather complacent in sharing. But, as we all know, it only takes one bad apple to ruin everything  and this one ruined my good streak.nnThe Cafe had come recommended and we were considering it for our monthly Meetup group breakfast so the hubs and I did our initial run.  We arrived at  on a Sunday morning after church and the place was nicely busy.  We had tried before to go there but the lines have always been too long so we were thrilled to finally be part of the incrowd LOL  About  of the tables were taken in the main dining area, the side room empty, the bar about  full. So not so busy that we sat  minutes without any contact or water.  Rule number  greet them, get them a cuppa, apologize if you are busy.  Okay. I am going to give them a  on that. nnWe ordered simple  a veggie omelet for hubs and a  egg over easy breakfast for me. We got our meal  minutes  count it   minutes later.  Not sure   I think they had to go in back to the henhouse and wait for the eggs to be laid.   minutes on a notsobusy morning.nnHubs omelet was fine. Chock full of pepper and onions, mushrooms, spinach, tomatoes.  It was a typical veggie omelet, nothing special.nnThe potatoes were uneven. They are steamed redskins that are them griddled which is not a bad way to make homefries I like to boil then griddle but same idea. The thin slices were really good and crispy  my plate was dark and yummy. Hubs, however, had thick slices that did not look griddled at all  they looked like a pasty Pittsburgher transplanted to the Valley of the Sun LOL and they were hard in the middle meaning those guys needed a tad more cooking. nnToast should not be a big deal  but it was drenched in something other than butter.  Liquid gold? Melted margarine? And it is thick Texas break so when I say soaked.....nnMy eggs, however, were the Waterloo for the day. Sunnyside up is not a tough option for an experienced cook.  I grew up cooking them in a skillet as well as on the grill since busy breakfasts mean multiple orders at once. Anyway, they came back.... not even undercooked.  The area around the yolk  maybe  in all directions  was clear. The eggs were not cooked.  Being the good girl I am, I didnt make a fuss  I asked the server if she would have the cook flip them on the grill and make them over easy  that was fine with me, I just could not eat raw whites.  When she brought it back, her comment was all I need to say Im sorry. He would not flip them over, he tried to cook them more sunnyside up which resulted in eggs that were oddly bipolar  the edges were SO overcooked, they were brittle and curled up, the center was slightly more solid but still undone.  As a server, she should have not brought them out. She knew it. There was no use sending them back  one more time on the grill and i could take them home and use them as Frisbees for the pup.  When she came back for refills, she never said a word at the uneaten eggs on my plate.nnFinally when she brought back my credit card to sign, she said sorry about the eggs. At that point, I was just ticked. I dont usually complain but I did. I say that the eggs were disgraceful, that the cook would allow them to go out like that and that she as a server should not have brought them out when he wouldnt remedy the situation. she said this is a family owned business, I cant tell the cook to do anything, they own this place. Wow. Just wow. I come from a familyowned business and, as anyone that knows me knows, I try to  onlygo to familyowned nonfrancise businesses except for Dairy Queen, but we all have vices..... If anything,those are the places where typically peopleowners DO care about their business and their reputation.  So, Henhouse Cafe  which is it? Do you really not care  in which case, shame on you, lots of other good restaurants in the area?  Or do you care, in which case, you ought to reprimand or fire the server?  Either way, I think the breakfast club will not be stopping by anytime soon....."
0,"Where do I friggin begin? nnWell, I was on the north side of town with my hubby and family getting haircuts at our fave barber. I go next door for a pedibrow wax and all is good. We stopped for lunch last weekend and decided to try this place since we liked the Henderson location last time. First impression....COLD. Literally and figuratively, that is. We looked on the wall at the thermostat and it was  degrees in the joint. WTF? It was  degrees outside! Cmon. Put out the money to keep your patrons happy and get some heat up in the hizzy. nnNext, we ordered a quesadilla plain,  pupusas, and some chorizo and eggs. No big deal right? Wrong. We had to send back the quesadilla, and they gave us one too many pupusas on the plate. When we mentioned this after her already having left the table, she took the plate back and replated with the correct amount of pupusas. Why did they take the extra one? Shouldnt that be the oh sorry, have one on the house for the mixup type of offering? I mean, you would think they just threw it away back there, right?nnMaybe, maybe not. Now I will tell you about the cleanliness of the place. They need to be visited by the health district and take some classes on how to properly handle and store food. The masa they use for the pupusas is prepared by bare hands. I know this because I watched everything go down through their open glass wall looking directly into their kitchen. I saw the lady touch the handle of her spatula with her masasoaked hands leaving it sticky. I then watched as the front register lady who touches the money used the spatula to flip a pupusa. Then the masa lady touched the spatula again and again. This is only one offense I will mention. nnI would have been more forgiving if I saw even one person, in the hour that I was there, wash their hands. The sink remained unused the whole time. No wonder my husband and I felt the afterburn an hour after leaving. You know what Im talking about. Shame on you Las Pupusas.nnAvoid this place like Richard Gere avoids gerbils."
0,"Second time I have eaten here, and the food was forgettable both times.  nnI am in Vegas a lot about xyear for work.  Went there one work trip for dinner with some other friends in town for same convention, and I went again about  weeks ago for breakfast. nnThey were accommodating and nice overall, but the service was reaaaallllyyyyy sloooooooowwwwwwwwwwww note as slow as it took for you to read all those extra letters, or what you are currently reading in this parenthesis, and the food was bland.  I dont even actually have any idea what I had there for dinner first time I was there. nnI understand this place is Mr Luckys and not Mr Chow in Beverly Hills, but I would hope that one person paying  for breakfast would end up with something a little tastier.  nnIf the prices were lower for the quality of the food, I would probably give it a star or two more, but I was just not that excited and wont be back there unless I am forced to again by lack of options and a furious hunger that cant be cured by POP Chips from the overpriced tourist convenience store."
0,"Pizza not that great sometimes burned and the salad  not fresh, and looks old dry, and the service is really bad either the real server is out and not at work yet,  and when you find someone, she wont take the order as she is doing something else, and so I should wait for this supposedly real server, or  they chat in one corner, and takes a long time for someone to come to your table   it is highly chaotic am not going back there. Odd service its a good place for kids, I guess. They need to replace this place with professional people or who really enjoys working there."

We had a truck full of our stuff to start unpacking that day after work. We got there around pm and didnt get in our house until pm  hours it took them to call the locksmith! The locksmith was amazed too cause he literally jumped in his truck after he got the call and took him  min. to get to our house!

0,"Eeehhh maybe i just dont get it but we left early. It seems like they just wasted time walking through the audience picking out people. They had a skit where they couldnt open a twinkie so they got a lady from the audience up there to do it. Then they all ate theres and threw it up through a chest piece, then ate that. There was a little bit of tricks with  big gigantic ipads and light effects. Marybe we missed all the good stuff because it was at the end but there was only  more minutes of it.

0,"I was really trying to avoid this, I dont like giving bad reviews. This is the th time Ive been to this location in about a month and every single time its taken upwards of  minutes to check out here. There is always a line whether its am or midnight. Its frustrating to run in for one thing and ALWAYS have to wait that long. Ive never seen them open another line either. The cashiers are really friendly, Ill give them that, but have no sense of urgency. Two stars for being open  hours, just not worth the wait though. Ill drive the extra mile to the CVS on Broadway if I need anything after pm."
0,"I signed up for the text specials and was in the area and thought I would finally stop in here with my yr old for lunch.  First frustration came when the kids meal had  sandwich options, one being salami.  Maybe its just me, but that seems like a strange choice for kids. Well my son didnt like any of the  choices and since you cant substitute I ended up getting him a  in meatball sub. because if course this sandwich didnt have a mini option.  I picked the roast beef and provolone or .  With the choice of mini,  in or giant I knew I was hungrier than a  in but theres no  inch option so I went with the  in giant.  I thought when I said  I was ordering a combo, but as I saw later on my receipt that was NOT the case.

0,"Not on a Sunday afternoon. Hickory Tavern has the potential of being a cool neighborhood bar. But it is not a Sunday afternoon family restaurant. The service was slow and inattentive. The food was mediocre. Everyone was in a days and forgot about why they are there. A good restaurant should seat the patrons as quick as possible, offer friendly fast service, and deliver highquality food at a reasonable price. According to these criterion Hickory Tavern failed on all counts."
0,"Had lunch here on a Saturday . This was our nd time here.  I give our original server  stars for being patient while we made up our minds but the restaurant was not incredibly busy.  The table was sticky and required  a wipedown.  Once we put our order in, it seemed to take a long time..  We ordered the Enchilada nachos and the Thai Chicken nachos second time we had it.  The food was adequate.  The first time we ate there, I had a more favorable impression.  The wait for our check was tortuous.  Luckily another server noticed we wanted to leave.  Given all the places in Vegas  Henderson to eat it, this wont be on our rotation anymore."
0,"I have always really liked this little dark and dingy hole in the wall for the beer only.  Their food is not good.  There isnt anything good on the menu other than beer dont even bother with it cuz over the years my husband and I have tried about  different things and they all consistently sucked however, the beer made up for it.  Its not like a typical brewery like lets say a Gordon Biersch where they have a few they make all year round and then  seasonal beer.  Papago specializes in beer.   Local beer, micro breweries, from other countries, states etc. If you have never been here it is definitely something to experience.  Papago is only getting a  star from me because the food sucks now and always has but also because we had the worst service there ever today.  We walked in and it was a bit busier than it usually is during the afternoon.  There were no seats at the bar so we sat at a table close by and tried to be patient but the servers were actively ignoring us and other customers were going to the bar since they were unable to get service.  After about  minutes of waiting I said excuse me to the waitress that walked by.  She definitely heard me and she didnt care so I went to the bar and asked the man if there was anyone to take care of the tables he said sure be there in a minute.  I asked if I could get a coconut joe and if I could sample  of the other coffee beers so I could figure out which of the  coffee beers I would take home with me and I told him that.  He said sure no prob.  My husband asked for a sample of something and another beer.  This guy brought me a tiny little sliver of a sample.  It was maybe  tablespoons.  The other samples he brought were a little bigger around  tablespoons.  He misunderstood my husband and rather than bringing him a sample of the one he asked for the guy brought him a full beer so my husband tastes it doesnt like it but based on the servers really crappy attitude there was no way my husband was going to say anything.  So the guy asks me if I liked the sample and I asked him for a full beer of it and said I couldnt really tell because there wasnt much in that glass. He got a bit pissy you could tell.  He must not have realized I asked for a full beer because he went and got me another sample and I said oh thank you that was nice.  Trying to lighten his mood which it did seem to do for a second then he said oh I brought you the wrong one that was what my husband was drinking the one he didnt like.  I am guessing he did it on purpose and then re thought it when I was nice to him.  Anyway long story way longer when I got the bill he charged . each for these tiny little samples that we got one that was not even a sample it was more like sweat on the glass.  I wasnt havin that crap.  I am not a newb.  I have been here before dude.  I asked him whats this?  He said oh well we are supposed to charge for the sample I am just doing what I was trained to do.  I said wow ok I never knew you charged for samples I have come for years this is the first time someone charged for a sample.  He says well I dont normally do that when people buy a beer but you said that one sample was too small.  I said wow I could see it all over your face how pissed off and aggravated you were that we wanted to sample but honestly we didnt ask for much only  a piece and we did buy a beer we bought several and brought two growlers in to fill to bring home.  We had a  bill.  Is this guy insane?  I normally dont do that if you buy a beer?  Am I in the twitlight zone.  Yes I said TWITLIGHT.  What a freakin TWIT.  So the idiot twit said I am done with you.  Can you believe this ass said I am done with you?   To my face none the less.  When I told him I could read his body language about how pissed off he was that was when he said I am done with you.  Little Effer.  I am done with you dude and done with that little hole in the wall and the bad treatment.  This little effer twit almost had a  or more tip but instead we left there with a bad taste in our mouth, he got a  tip and Papago gets this crappy review."
0,"This is the most disappointing dining experience Ive had in a very, very long time. Two of my friends that dined with me this evening are also leaving reviews, as it was blaringly clear to not only myself, but to them as well, how bad the food AND service were at this establishment. nnThis pizza is truly awful and ridiculously over priced. I was literally shocked at the sad appearance of the pizza when it was placed on the table, especially because it took a so long to arrive we were there on a Monday with only  other small parties in the restaurant, one of which had already eaten . The toppings looked wilted and old and the first thing I thought was that doesnt look right... when it arrived. There is little to no sauce on this pizzaso its probably not surprising that they charge a ridiculous  dollars for a small ramekin of sauce, which also took about  minutes to arrive at the table, after we requested it after our pizza arrived whenn n we realized there was essentially no sauce on it.  dollars for a  inch, thin, sauceless, wilted topping pizza! I really cant get over their audacity for charging that much for such a poor product. Im not being hyperbolic when I say a  dollar frozen pizza would have been more satisfying.nnThe service was slow an inattentive. We had to ask twice for water and had to hunt down our server to pay our bill.nnIm baffled at the reviews that gave this pizza and place  stars. This eating experience left me unsatisfied, bummed out, and truly mad about the waste of money. Please. Go elsewhere."
0,"The worst watch repair shop in Las Vegas. Brought my watch here to simply change the battery, took about  min and ., but they also left  long scratches on the back of my watch. Ive never seen any watch repair professional leave scratches on handling such a simple task of changing a battery, very unprofessional. And the worst part was that they pretended nothing happened, and acted like it wasnt their fault. I was shocked."
0,"CAUTION Mild ranting to follow...nnI went to this coffee shop after having just arrived to the Cosmo, our hotel, after a  hour drive thus, coffee was a necessity! nnAnyway, I was happy they had almond milk, BUT dismayed by the price.  for a regular almond milk  hazelnut latte.  In addition, I asked for a cup of water and the barista tried to charge me ., so I said forget it.  The flavor of the coffee was fine, but it was nothing special.  After having Stumptown coffee in New York for cheaper than , this was a joke.  nnI know Vegas is expensive, but there are other coffee shops that will probably be cheaper in Vegas.  Some cons, though, are that if you want a flavor shot or almond milk, they charge a lot more.  For hazelnut flavor, they charged me like . and then another .. for the almond milk, which added up to a ridiculous ! nn...end of rant.nnOverall, not worth it.  I would venture across the street to the Coffee Bean  Tea Leaf. It is a bit pricey as well with flavor shots and nondairy milk substitutes but at least they give you a  ounce beverage, instead of a doubletheprice  ounce beverage.  If worse comes to worse...cant believe I am saying this...just go to Starbucks...at least you know the price is standard and what to expect."

0,"We were looking for an Indian buffet place for lunch, so a quick search on Yelp threw up Everest Indias Cuisine with good reviews so we decided to give it a try. As usual I was skeptical of any Indian place with good reviews but decided to give it a try hoping to be proved wrong. Mount Everest is located on Sahara Avenue not too far from the strip and has sufficient parking so location and accessibility is fine.nnWhen we entered at peak lunch hour on Sunday the place was packed which I took as a good sign. As the restaurant is small and tables are cramped close to each other so seating is very uncomfortable and navigating to and from the buffet is painful as you void bumping into other diners.nnThe dishes were standard fare that you will find in any Indian buffet. The appetizers included tandoori chicken, samosa and some fried potato dish. Butter chicken, saag, chili chicken and mutton curry were entrees. Then there was steamed rice and dal and lastly gulab jamun and sweet rice for desert.nnTaste wise what stood out to me was that every dish was bad. Not just one or two items but everything that I ate was the text book definition of bad Indian food. Tandoori chicken seemed to be boiled and then doused with a lot of color as it lacked any flavor at all and was stone cold. The samosa seemed to be undercooked. The pan fried potato were limp and seemed to be days old. The butter chicken was barely edible. Chili chicken tasted gross and the goat in the mutton curry was undercooked so was chewy not one person in our entire group could eat the goat. The naan provided at the table was thin and overcooked so it felt like a crispy flatbread. We asked for garlic naan which was better but it came at the fag end of the meal so it was almost useless. The gulab jamun was one of the worst that Id ever had and the sweet rice was forgettable. I also noticed that there was no biryani in this buffet.nnService was also slow. As mentioned garlic naan was provided at the end of the meal. Plates were not cleared quickly so we ended up stacking them in one corner which made the small table feel even more cramped. Even stacked plates did not prompt quick service and at one time we were scared that the plates would topple over and cause a mess but that did not deter our servers from ignoring them.nnAt the end of the meal I was happy to be out of this small, cramped, claustrophobic place with terrible food. A sentiment echoed by each and every member of our group that ate here.nnPrice wise it was . which is typical for Indian buffets but what I cant get is the high ratings for this place. unfortunately another Indian restaurant that did not live up to its sky high ratings. Obviously wont make the mistake of returning again."
0,"If the Chop and Chick is Guy Fieris favorite breakfast dish, his credibility has dropped a few points.  I wanted to like it... heck, this was one of the reasons I drove out to Phoenix, but the pork chop didnt do it for me.  It was dry and there just wasnt enough pesto to grab my attention.n nThe hash browns saved the meal for me though.  They reminded me of the way my mom used to make them very thinlysliced, a little on the oily side and extremely crispy.  I can eat this forever.n nYes, the place is small and the wait is long, but I wont dock any points for that, even though it was in  degree weather waiting is all part of the experience."
0,"My buddy, originally from Brooklyn and Jewish, so he knows his delis, warned me that this place was worthless.nnI, against better judgement, decided to try it anyway.nnThe breads were done really well and the snacks were good which is the only reason it got two stars, but the food itself sucked llama balls.nnI barely finished my sandwich and threw out most of it. If I wanted to eat kraft singles, Id buy it at the supermarket.nnIn the only way they could understand since they are so brooklyn, FUCK YOU HEIDI AND YOUR FUCKING LOUSY WANNABE BROOKLYN DELI."
0,"For as far as we had to drive to get there  a  minute selfguided tour, WAY over priced chocolate in the store  a cactus garden that we didnt even get to look at.

0,"While I love seafood, Im afraid I have to agree with the previous poster  had a horrible experience here with one of the Crab Pot dishes  one thing about seafood such as crab, mussels, etc., is that it needs to be very well cooked, or one is asking for trouble!  My dish was not, and as a result, I found plenty of trouble!  Its too bad, because we had gone here in September of , and it was much better.  Things seem to have really gone downhill since then."
0,"My family and I had a late lunch here on Christmas Day.  There was a good variety of foods for the Christmas Day menu, but flavor was average.  Our waitress never came to check on us and when we needed a refill on drinks, we had to track her down.  Because our waitress never checked on us, our used plates were piling up.  A couple of other waitresses were clearing off a table nearby, so we brought our used plates to them and asked if we could hand the plates over to them.  Their response, Yah, I guess."
0,"I decided to give this place a try because its close to the most delectable Angel Sweet!! despite the nyehhh review my friend gave of it and now I know, nyehhh x.  My falafel pita was pretty sad, it almost made me cry!nnThe falafel was a little bland and thickly caked, a little hard to get down at times.  The lettuce had seen better days to be sure, the onion had the texture of one thatd been forgotten in the back of the fridge for a few weeks and the tomato was green  no offense against green tomatoes  when youre in Alabama and theyre fried!  But the worst thing about it  no pickled cucumber?!?!?!  Huh???!!!nnI noticed they were cleverly upselling extra sauce to everyone  at . a pop, I fell for it but it did help me get the chunky falafel down.  Maybe falafel isnt their strong suit but even with another decent filling the veggies just wouldnt cut it for me.  Always trying to find something positive though... well...  the guy that waited on me had great hair, and the pita bread was decent I guess.  Ill drive x the distance to have a pita x as good and cheaper! at Haji Baba."

0,"Generally speaking, Im a huge fan of the Jos. A. Bank line of stores.  Ive found their service, prices, quality, and selection to be absolutely top notch.  However, the Jos. A. Bank in Middleton may very well be one of the worst stores in the chain that Ive ever visited.nnIve visited their store on several occasions, and have always felt as if I was bothering them by walking in the door.  Those suspicions were confirmed today, when I stopped in to have the three pair of pants that I had purchased from the Jos. A. Bank in Rogers, AR tailored and hemmed.nnI walked in to the store, which was for the most part empty, and stood at the counter for a few minutes before a gentleman reluctantly asked if he could help me with anything.  I believe he thought I was there to return the pants when I asked if I could be fitted for the pants that I had bought last week, he let out a sigh and said, yeah, but they wont be ready for like three weeks  were really backed up.nnI didnt care about the timeline I have dozens of pairs of pants to wear, so the wait was no big deal.  I shared that info with him, and he sighed again and said, ok, come on back here.nnAfter he finished fitting me for the three pairs of pants, a manager or I assume the person was a manager stopped by and noticed that the gentleman had set a delivery date that was three weeks out.  The manager said, These are just a hem? We can get that done by Thursday.  He doesnt have to wait three weeks.nnThe guy that was fitting me said, Oh, I wasnt sure how busy we were, or if we were backedup.nnI then said, Guys, Im not in any hurry  its no big deal, so take your time.  To which the manager replied, No, were ok right now, so its not a problem.  We could probably have them by tomorrow.nnSo then the guy who was fitting my pants said, Yeah, you can pick them up on Thursday.  Ok, lets get you up front to pay for this.  nnI was shocked Id never paid for tailoring at a Jos A Bank store before.  When I asked why there was a charge, the guy said, We always charge for tailoring, yep, always do.  So,  later, I guess Ill have three pairs of pants hemmed by Thursday rather than early August as originally quoted...nnOn a whim, I called my old Jos. A Bank store in Arkansas, and spoke to one of the sales people and asked about the tailoring fee.  He said, Were supposed to charge for it, but if you bought three pair of fullprice pants from us, wed usually do it as a service to our customer.nnI asked the guy at the Middleton store about that policy, and he said, They should all be fired there.  Thats ridiculous.  We always charge. Youd get fired if you didnt.nnSo, there you have it.  Too bad for the customer.  Im done with Jos. A Bank.  Never again  at least not from this location."
0,"I used to be a regular to this bar and stopped coming after a round I awful service and being over charged. Decided to give it a second go and was sorely disappointed. The Mac and cheese was average at best, the warm chicken for my salad was luke warm, and the Caesar salad was from a bag quality with what seemed to be packaged dressing. It was half off wine night which was nice and we did enjoy the wine. The waitress however was not at all knowledgeable about the wine. Dessert was also less than incredible, the strawberry shortcake was clearly a frozen pound cake and the bengets were also not worth trying. I gave this place a second chance because I had I groupon but it wasnt even worth that. I will not be returning unless its for a bottle of wine in the bar."
0,My feet were frozen in place.. I couldnt back out now! My friend dragged me into this place for karaoke.. as soon as I walked in the door I wanted to turn around and walk back out. This place is the dive gay bar in town.. there was some horrid karaoke going on in the front and some incoherent benefit show going on in the back.. the patio seemed nice enough but not a soul out there cept  drag queens smoking. nnAs soon as this guy started singing some song from Phantom we knew it was time to go. Couldnt stand another second in this place.. just not my scene.. my friend was irritated we wanted to leave..
0,"Terrible service! I dont recommend this place to anyone! They cant even file nails right, my nails were all crooked and uneven, so they sent another lady over to try and get it right. While she was filing my nails they were talking about me in Chinese or Vietnamese...I believe Chinese...who knows! I asked them to stop and I let them know it was rude! The whole experience was a nightmare! I walked out with nail polish on top of my cuticles! I doubt they even went to school to do nails! Other customers were laughing at me! These people are beyond rude! Never go there!!!!!!!!!"

ONE line for beef tongue  tripe  beef shoulder. nnSo I lined up and waited to get one beef tongue taco and one beef shoulder. So I waited ... and waited ... and waited ...nnWhy did it take so long? Oh I see, everyone was ordering at least  tacos for each order. Taco El Gordo, how can you only have one line for beef tongue  should line? Anyhow, and so I waited for  minutes ... nnFinally it got to my turn! And guess what? THEY RAN OUT OF BEEF SHOULDER ! Dude, not cool at all. I only ordered beef tongue and beef tripe tacos. nnIn the end, I basically did not want to wait in another line and I just simply overpaid for a  carne asada fries because there was no line. Oh, did I also mention it took them another  minutes just to get the fries out?  nnWell, these tacos better be amazing right?nntacos de lengua beef tongue  . each and tacos de tripa beef tripe   each For  tacos, they tasted okay. Is it worth  minutes wait? Hell no!  nnTaco de adobada spicy pork   Probably the best taco out of all three that Ive ordered, but it wasnt crazily good. nnCarne asada fries  Not like it was awful, just not at the price that I paid for. I still cant believe I paid  for somewhat average fries  would be a better price. nnI will stick with my East LA tacos ... they are still the bomb and my ultimate taco standards."

0,"Nachso good servicenAngie.  Last night we returned to see if our service would be better than my previous trip as outlined below.nWe brought a friend from BC for some food and drinks. Upon arrival there was a table on the patio with customers so we chose the opposite side after waiting a short time my wife went in and asked the Bartender if we could get service. Answer was yes.  minutes passed , no service so she went inside ordered  shots of Julio  and a Reposado.  Finally a server with Bunny ears came out and took our food order.nReally piss poor service.  I get it.  Downtown deals with tourists equals crappy service.  Hopefully your new store in Summerlin will care about and cater to locals.  Will give it one last try.  Thx EarlenWe stopped in to check NDs out.  Heard about Nachos from watching it on the TV show Mystery Diners. Also a big sign out front advertising  tacos and  Titos nWe sat at the Bar and had a great time talking with him. The day we dined was National Taco Day as well as Vodka Day. Go figure. Tacos and Vodka.  With that said.  Nachos had  Titos cocktails. So we had street tacos and Titos nLater that evening we decided to return with a friend for a cocktail. We ordered  Titos and service was really slow different bartender  took forever to pay.  Got the bill and the bartender charged us  a drink instead of the posted  price. After some discussion they finally adjusted the bill. Then sent a guy out front to take down the posted special sign.  Not sure if or when we will return"
0,"Chipotle claims they have Gluten Free food. Weve had good experience with other locations, but this one is repeatedly clueless when it comes to Gluten Free. Their staff is incompetent when you even say the word Gluten Free because theyve never heard of the term or cant understand.  They have lost our frequent business forever. We love their food, but not if I cant get them to prepare it in accordance to what they say they can do."
0,"Booked hotel room on a holiday weekend before resort fee has activated. So we were happy the extra charge was not placed on our bill, nor did we have to pay a parking fee. I must say that the room was clean and modern, which was expected after the big remodel. I was surprised to learn that this hotel no longer is part of the Freemont Experience association due to some dispute with the group. There was a long line to check in and the usual security guard to check hotel cards before you got on the elevator. Found that to be a false sense of security. The Asian cafe in the lobby served good food for the price and the cupcake shop had very good quality cakes. Where I had the problem was housekeeping never came to clean our room. We tried to call twice and was placed on hold for several minutes. Finally my husband went down to the lobby to complain and he was told housekeeping second shift doesnt start until  pm. So we waited and waited..no one ever came up. I found the housekeeping closet open and helped myself to water and clean towels. I was not going to do the bed linen too. Nothing was ever resolved and so I had to post this review. With so many hotel options in Las Vegas, I dont plan on ever staying here again. By the way, fair warning that there is train track in the back of the hotel. Pretty regular train schedule, even in the middle of the night."
0,"It was an interesting experience, but I dont think I would go again.nnI took my friend to this restaurant as part of her bachelorette weekend.  The experience was very interesting and a bit scary at times I almost panicked couple of times, it is scary to be in total darkness, but the food wasnt amazing.  I had the avocado salad and steak for the main course.nnAlso, I have talked about this kind of experience with my blind friend, and he said he didnt like this kind of restaurants, because it doesnt accurately show how a blind persons life is like.  All of a sudden not being able to see when we always depended on sight is quite different from being blind all your life.nnBut I guess if you want to experience something different from typical restaurants, you can try this place!"

0,"Went later on Sunday and waited for  min for two people, very irritating...when we eventually were served the food was just..OK. Ive eaten at many similar type restaurants in So.

I have been wanting to try this place always trying to expand my brunch options! My sister and I put our name in and waited on the beach chairs out front Love those! and people watched. Our name was called and they put us at a booth inside. We noticed  high tops were available on the patio. I asked for one and she sat us out there. Have no hostesses ever played Sallys Diner?! Gotta maximize and not use up all your  tops with just  people! nnOur server was nice....but not very experienced. My sister asked for a coffee recommendation and the caramel latte she got was almost minty. Not delish. I had just a coffee....which was rarely filled unless I asked. At one point I asked her to warm up my coffee a little bit. She poured a tiny amount in and asked if it was okay. Haha Gotta get up on your brunch lingo, girl! Plus, I feel like I should never have to ask for a refill. Maybe that makes me a diva. What ever. We waited quite a while for our food okay it was a Saturday morningI can understand that. BUT! When our food came it was luke warm at best. She never asked how our food was and dropped off our check with a yep. No we didnt want anything else, or a box, or anything..... Our plates were never cleared. We ended up walking the bill up to our server at the hostess stand....where she was standing and not refilling my coffee.   The food would have been good if it was hot but the service REALLY killed it for us. It was kind if painful being able to see The Breakfast Club from where I was sitting...next time Ill probably go there."

Second they have a condiment table where u can get your own pickled jalapenos and easily throw them on your burger just like they did. nNow for their cheese. I will not eat a burger without cheese, but their cheese was so bad that I rather eat the burger plain. It tasted like watered down Kraft American cheese singles.nThe lettuce in the burger was limp, had no crunch, no flavor, it was really dark. It did not look appetizing at all. nThe meat was ok but I think it was a little over done. nThe only good thing I have to say about this meal was the fries."

0,"If I could, I would absolutely give them  stars. nAs for customer service they are very rude! We had booked a no  smoke room with a king bed and end up getting to their liking. Which by the way they never informed us of any changes We ended up getting a smoking room with  twin beds. I have asthma and I informed them the room smell was of extreme nuisance to me and then they replied with there was nothing they could do. I was not about to risk MY health and my daughters health. They became even more rude and hostile when I had no other choice but to resign the room and urge them for a reimbursement.  They wanted me entirely off the premises. They told me we need you to vacate the room ASAP and leave the premises no apology was given for the unnecessary inconvenience. I will never come here again! And I would advise you as well to stay somewhere else."

Really only because I moved to this side of town.the pharmacy is so busy that even with all the staff they have the pharmacy staff and pharmacists cant keep up and provide the customer service I think they would like to. The wait is always horrible. If you fill your prescription online or call it in, it is never done by the pick up time you request. Im sure if they build another CVS close to this location it would help lighten this stores load."
0,"Came here for Christmas dinner with my mother. Big mistake.  oclock and they were packed! I couldnt believe it. We waited  mins for a table which we didnt mind, we were in no rush. After getting our drinks, we ordered some guacamole and chips as our appetizer. We waited and waited, finally, like  minutes later watery guacamole it looked like pea soup and the WORST tortilla chips came out. The chips were so stale we couldnt finish our one bite they were also soaked in grease. We spit it out and told our waitress. She brought us new chips that were not much better, but edible. We kept the soupy guac, as we hated to complain...they were so busy we just blew that off. I got the bruschetta chicken pasta but asked for shrimp instead of chicken. I dont do dairy, so asked for no cheese. Waitress said no problem. Mom got a ribeye steak and shrimp with sweet potato fries. The food came after  minutes. My pasta with extra cheese. Ugh...and  of the rawest shrimp sitting on top. Sent it back because I cant eat cheese. Waitress brought a new one without cheese. I like my shrimp well done, or at least cooked to a healthy and safe temp. She brought the new pasta, it was ice cold. Then she took back the shrimp and left the pasta! So the cold pasta was left to get even colder while they fixed the shrimp. Then when she brought the shrimp they had to microwave my dinner to get it hot again...resulting in it being dryer than dry. Ekkk. Moms steak was served in a pool of butter and grease. Literally. She used all the napkins at the table to sop it all up. Some of her fries were wet and mushy from the butter. And the shrimp was missing from her plate! After asking several times they finally brought it. Nothing special. Just shrimp. We used a coupon buy one get on free. They charged us  for my four raw shrimp. It was ridiculous. Yes, it was Christmas, but really? This experience should have been better. Even for Christmas night. I dont think we will be back."

They did their best to accommodate the situation which was a nice gesture until check out when they said the things purchased didnt fall into the category of the credit we received and we should have seen it on the card with the listed places we can use it on.

Corion was the promoter that sold us the table earlier in the day....anyway....nnMusic was okay, I didnt enjoy it much, it was a combination between hip hop, techno or rap, I just remembered I didnt love the music. Im a hiphop type of person and there was a lot of remixes with techno beats. nnWont be returning because of the unprofessional promoter, although I want to compliment on the great service at the table area."
0,Very disappointing. I went here on Yelpers recommendations. What a mistake.nnI got the shrimp tempura udon. The broth was flavorless. At least the tempura was cooked well. Also got a flying fish roe sushi. VERY FISHY TASTING.nnTwo of my friends and I that ate the shrimp got sick. POISONED. The other friend didnt eat the shrimp and was fine. Punk.nnBeware. Be scared.
0,"Warning Im not a buffet person, nor will I ever be. The concept of unlimited food disturbs me so read on with caution... nnnKind of a scary place but if you want a salad and lots of it, I guess its a good choice. I love the name Sweet Tomatoes which is why I came here in the first place but there really isnt much sweet about watching a slue of morbidly obese children return to the ice cream machine  times for refills."
0,"I am giving this place  extra star since I love the sauce that they sell at stores for enchiladas. So I decided to go here and give the real thing a try. Man was I surprised....they dont even use their own sauce they sell. The sauce that landed on my tongue was gross, I tried to start over in my head thinking maybe I was expecting to much but the meat inside was not any better. To top all this off the sewer was over flowing outside and was stinking up the night air. Even though my wife said she liked what she ate this is my review and I would never return. Learn from this review and use the sauce that you sell at Walmart and things will start to get better."
0,"This hotel is one of the oldest ones in Las Vegas.  Unlike the Palace Station, which is old as well, Ballys has not been maintained and cared for.  Starting with front desk people.  Not welcoming no friendly greetings.  The rooms are really worn and dirty.  One of those rooms where you do not walk in the room in your bare feet.  Beds sup par along with bedding.  Old furniture.  Towels threadbare.  Food even splattered on the walls in our room.  Pool is a joke and watch out for the extra hotel fees.  Do not stay here unless you are desperate."
0,Internet connection is the worst that I have experience at any hotel.  I came here for Memorial Day Weekend and unfortunately for me I had homework that needed to be submitted by midnight Sunday.  I first tried to connect in the room and it took over  minutes to get a connection.  The next day I went down to the lobby to work and I couldnt get connected no matter what I tried.  I eventually called the technical support desk and he finally assigned my IP addressed.  Later that night I tried to sign in from the room again and I couldnt.  I called the tech desk yet again and he had to assign my IP addressed.  I asked him why I was having so many problems and he told me the service provided sucks.  If it is so bad  they might want to consider another provider.  Note to self NEVER get COX Communications for anything.  This is NOT the experience that I expect to have at the Bellagio.  Marriott Courtyard has better internet.
0,"This review is for lunchtime service.nnJust not good enough given what we paid. At around  per personthats including two kids by the wayI would expect much better food and quality of fish. The snapper was very chewy. And the biggest disappointment was the ISO Fantastic roll. This is one of the more expensive rolls you can get at Takara. It has tuna, salmon and yellowtail.. plus avocado. Should be awesome! In this case, it was nearly flavorless, and the fish chewy again. I was stacking up ginger and wasabi to try to get anything out of it.nnThe only redeeming fish was the yellowtail, which had a good texture and flavor. nnOur server was great, prompt and friendly with substitutions for the kids. Takara also has a really great ambiance. Sadly, the priceperformance of the food warrants only two stars."
0,"The worst hotel experience of my life.  After waiting over a half hour to speak to someone from management about my qualms with the property, I was met with hostility and asked to leave the hotel.  The manager, Guillaume Benezech who claimed he owned the hotel told my guest that he would not charge me for the breakfast if we would promptly leave the property.  We left immediately and then he continued to bill me for breakfast a bill which employees took the liberty to fill out themselves.  It took me one week, three promised telephone calls from customer service that were never made, and my own initiating contact in order to be reimbursed for the fraudulent charging of the breakfast.  There has been no effort to compensate me for the humiliating experience I paid over , dollars to endure.  It is evident that with the departure of Horst Schulze that the RitzCarlton has lost its mystique.  A hotel corporation that once functioned like a work of art is now worse than a rundown movie theatre."
0,"I looked forward to coming for some time as my wife and I really enjoy this sense of humor.  If you come just for the humor, some of the waiters just seem to force it...just to do their job.  The food?  Horrible! and at high cost.  I ordered the wings and they might be the worst I ever had.  Dry and very little flavor.  nnLastly, what upset us the most was the waiters attitude.  Upon leaving the people who took our seats came up to us to let us know their disappointment for not leaving a tip.  WHAT?  The waiter told them that we stiffed him.  First, this was untrue as we left cash in the check wallet and secondly, why not be a man and approach us yourself instead of whining to the next table.  Just came off as extremely unprofessional.  We loved Vegas on our last trip and unfortunately this was our only misstep of a planned stop."
0,"Usually like to try new breakfast items once in awhile, but should have passed on the new fresh baked biscuit sandwiches. McDs still does a better sandwich in the AM. The biscuit was not biscuit crumbly like, but more of an English muffin taste. Bacon was fatty for the most part, although they were generous with the stuff and the eggs were blah. The price was right as it was two for , but besides that, this wasnt any kind of breakfast breakthrough."
0,I think Gordon Ramsey needs to practice what he preaches. I love his shows where he is always complaining about the food being too cold or raw. I had lunch at about  pm.    I had the damnation chicken burger which was served slightly above room temperature. It taste fine but there was no heat to the burger that boasted jalapino as a main ingredient. I did not see a jalapino anywhere. It was cooked through and served on a plate with no garnish just an empty plate.nI also got the chocolate and carmel milkshake. This was served just above room temperature. Not cold like a good shake. It also had the caramel as a layer on top of the chocolate. I had to stir the shake to combine the caramel into the chocolate and since it was filled so high it spilled over the edge down the side and onto the table. I had to get someone to clean up the mess.nI also got the sweet potato fries. They were also served just above room temp. Covered in powdered sugar with a dipping sauce that was like weak lemon curd it was more of a dessert that fries. The fries were cooked well but I could only eat about onefourth of the order. It was a huge amount of fries that could easily feed two or three people. I was so over taken by the sugar on the fries that I had to stop eating them as I was starting to not feel well. By the time I left I was not well at all. I started having an upset stomach and really bad gas as well as feeling like I had motion sickness. This continued all night and I felt so bad I could not eat anything  for the rest of the night. That was last night This morning I feel better but bloated.nI was not impressed with the food though I really wanted to be impressed. The decor is nice and the staff is young and sexy. I guess Gordon is selling sex appeal to make up for the food. The music was bit loud so people had to talk louder to be heard which made for a very loud lunch. They had wide screen tv sets to watch so I watched all the fast food commercials. I spent  with tax and tip for lunch. I have had meals at Red Robbin and Subways that I have enjoyed more. Go by the place and take pictures of the fire wall but pass the meal and get something cheaper at the food court.

0,"I have been a member for almost  years and never had a problem with finding a group x class to fit my schedule or experienced over crowding in the main area. nnHowever, times have changed in the past  months. Zumba classes are becoming overcrowded. It is maxed out way over the building fire code and they dont enforce it. If you are in line early, it doesnt matter. You will get pushed back into the corner as people arrive late and crowd up the space. There are no ceiling fans and it gets hot and very humid and thick. They need to add more classes or enforce the limited space and do first come, first serve. I dont pay a membership to not be able to access all the features and not get an effective workout.nnI left class early today because I had no where to move, I was bumping into people, couldnt see the instructor, and was feeling a heat stroke coming on, though I was properly hydrating myself. It was torture, not fun like it use to be. I wasnt even at the class that was at the busiest time of day!nnThe other day my friend had to leave because they were short staffed and the Kids Club was filled up. If it is during Zumba, you can guarantee its going to be busy for kids too. They should have staffed the area properly.nnI feel my money would be best suited at a private studio rather than a gym."

She could not believe that he was trying to sell me the suit, and she LAUGHED AT me for not knowing about proper fit.  nnSecond, when I finally did pick up my suit, which I needed to be perfect, as my plane left the next morning, they screwed it up.

0,"My husband and I live in Surprise, Arizona. This SCAM company works in several states from what I have found. nWhat happened to us is below, along with an update and a list of other company names I am aware of them using. nnSCAM!!!My husband and I had a terrible experience. We purchased a coupon on living social for . Here is what it says the coupon covers   value for wholehouse air duct cleaning Includes cleaning of unlimited supply ducts, one return vent  one return dryer vent. And the coupon is under the name Expert Air Duct Pros. My husband scheduled the appointment and they made us schedule  months out, as they didnt have any openings earlier. Then they called  times within  days and on the day of the appointment trying to cancel and reschedule the appointment. There were several excuses, the tech is over booked, the tech had a family emergency, they no longer were available at that time, they again had to change the time. Finally the tech showed up his name was Issac, very thick European accent with a shirt on that said US Air Solutions and his paperwork said Mr. Duct Cleaning. Before even looking at the system or starting to work said the coupon doesnt cover everything we need done, it will cost more money to do everything, and then tried to only clean the return vent instead of what we paid for which is listed above. Then he called the manager. The manager was extremely rude and argumentative. We scheduled and rescheduled appointments to accommodate them and they left without doing any work. The coupon is very clear on what it covers, I will never recommend this company to anyone! SCAM!!nnTo my knowledge you are using  different company namesnExpert Air Duct Pros  Name on the livingsocial coupon along with a websitenUS Air Services Name on this yelp accountnMr. Duct Cleaning Name on techs paperworknBlue Sky Air Solutions Name employee gave me over the phonenUS Air Solutions Name employees gave me over the phone, name on the techs shirt and was used in a reply to another customer here on yelp along with the name US Air Services.nSpoke to the NEW owner of US Air Solutions LLC. and from what he described and told me they are affiliated with this company that is scamming people. The previous owner andor employees are still using there old company name US Air Solutions along with all the other names I listed!nnUPDATE!nMy husband was called by the owner of this scam! His name is Ray, he said he doesnt work directly with the techs, he just gets paid the coupon amount from livingsocial, groupon, and any other coupon sites and the techs that go on the service call only gets paid when they sale additional services and that is the only way the techs make money! TOTAL SCAM!!! He also is doing this under several company names including U.S. Air Solutions, he is NOT affiliated with U.S. Air Solutions. nThe real US Air Solutions doesnt even do air duct services they only do air conditioner services! nSince they outsource all of the techs I think this might be part of the reason there are so many different company names. From what I have found they are using this scam in several different states!nNow Ray did offer to send us a refund, which we are glad he is doing that. But this is still a total scam, the old bait and switch.nHe also told my husband his companies name is Custom Air Specialists LLC so now  different names I know of.nnOh, and like other complaints I have read he claims he will no longer work with the tech who was sent to our house. His name was Isaac his paperwork said Mr. Duct Cleaning, his shirt said US Air Solutions, and he has a very thick European accent. I saw another complaint on here that described the tech that was sent to there house that sounded like the same one that was sent to our house. And the manager said they would fire that tech, so who knows if they are being honest about not working with Isaac anymore."
0,"Wow! I took my sister there because she heard so much about it, being from Kansas.... Im her big brother and expected to treat her to whatever she wanted.

0,"How long as my review of Espionage been brewing? Joe A specifically told me not to review it. It has its own charm! Its own class! Its own sort of appeal!nnYes, it has a hot dog stand after pm or so. And yes there are several floors with different styles of music so you can mix it up. And yes I did spend a night here, till almost close .am or so bopping the night away and having a good time. But I think thats largely due to the good group of friends I was with. nnThe Nage thats what I used to call the one up in Aberdeen anyway is a victim of its own, um, nageness. It mainly attracts outoftowners and stag dos. And Fresher students. A place is really just a sum of all its parts, so if the crowd isnt that great then its not going to be that great a place.nnWhen we first walked in, we were pretty much the ONLY women. I kid you not. It was a sausage fest as a fellow Yelper would describe it. I wasnt intimidated. But then it also smelled REALLY bad.

But its hard to get into a really good goingout getmydanceon groove when youre just not feeling the crowdnnI WOULD come back here if a good friend was having a special night out and really wanted to get her dance on here. But its just not my crowed, not my scene. Its free to get in so a cheap night out for a dance. And Edinburgh is lacking a consistently good dancey place. But Id rather go to nights I know Im gonna get my boogie on Green Door, for instance. Sorry Nage, you were fun in the Deen when I was , but just not any more."
0,"After being mistreated and misled by Pinnacle Nissan, Coulter looked promising based on the reviews on yelp and the advertised prices they have.   I was in the market for a Nissan Leaf and they had one equipped just the way I wanted it.  I called in and spoke to Geri and got my quotes, and went over the numbers a couple of times and was assured they would not change after taking the  mile trek to their dealership.   Guess what, the numbers changed, but thats not the end.  The car they had was a Back Leaf with Black interior, not my first choice.   They checked with other dealers and found a White with grey interior that they were to trade the White for.   nnThis is where the story becomes grey.   They tell me the numbers were miscalculated and it was a looser deal, but they would honor the price.   My opinion was very high of Coulter at that moment,  better yet they found a white car to trade for their black  but while getting the numbers straightened out they sold black car to a couple that came in an hour after us.   I was told no problem, we shook on the deal, left a deposit and were to come back the next day to pick up the white car.nnNext day I get a call, deals off they cant get the white car any longer, the other dealer wanted a trade and now they had nothing to trade so sorry.   Sure they were not going to go out of their way to accommodate this looser deal.   Point being in the end they did not stand by their agreement.nnWhats amazing about car dealers  they are not bound by their agreements  yet if you were to not pay for a car all hell would be unleashed upon you."
0,"Many people who reviewed that place say that they have been in California or Texas, that they know what good burritos taste like, etc. Well, I have also lived on the West Coast, been to CA and TX, and I was quite disappointed with this burrito place. I wont say I was surprised, because we live in Montreal and its so hard to find good Mexican or Tex Mex food around here. But the service was slow, and I was not impressed with the food. For example, the fillings were not evenly placed in the burrito, so there were bites with just rice, nothing else. Dont waste your time and money there."
0,"Our first experience to Librettos was on July . The pizza was terrific. Headed back the following Saturday, , with the family. Ordered two pies sicilian and white pizza. I dont think Ive ever had this happen. Someone reheated the white pizza from the case! It was stale, burnt, brown on top, quite disgusting. I informed our server who tasted it for himself to see if he agreed. We had to wait for another pie to be prepared fresh. No adjustment made in our bill. No apology from a manager. Too many other places to get pizza in Charlotte. Oh and how do we know the pizza came from the case? It was full when we came in one pie was missing when we left.nnWont be back at Librettos."
0,"Terrible! Good piece of fish with tasteless batter, frozen fries,  peas that must have been cooked at least two days previously. Either the cook was gone, or the reviews have been loaded by friends , relatives, and employees. We cannot believe that this ever got a best rating."
0,"The Willy St locale feels a bit awkward. There is a constant weird scent in the air, no its not herb, more like incense. The space feels more like a converted storefront than a restaurant. The menu wasnt particularly large which was a bit unfortunate. I think among  of us we only had  different dishes at the table. nnThe jerk meats are good, you dont quite get the spread you get at Jolly Bobs, but its good, well spiced but balanced. The sides are as to be expected, plantains, veggies and rice all of which are fine. nnThe price is definitely a bit of an issue. In fairness, all the Caribbean places in Madison are not cheap Here, Jolly Bobs  Costa Rica Cafe. So ya know perhaps the time it takes to marinate makes all these places a bit more expensive. The problem is they dont look visually high end so youre wondering where exactly the money is going. nnOverall, if I wanted jerk chicken Id probably shoot for their cart in library mall or since the restaurant isnt much to experience, paying for it doesnt really add anything Id just order takeout when I really craved it. Personally, while the meats are good, I prefer the flavors at J Bobs and Costa Rica Cafe and think their value is a better."
0,Worse service ever!!!!!! Dont bother with this Village Inn. The management is awful. There are too many other Village Inns in the area to deal with the poor service. The one on Power  Ray is a better option.
0,"Visited the Phoenix area to see Stanhope a few months ago and the main problem wtih this club is people are packed in like sardines.  nnI understand the club trying to make a buck, but be prepared to not move and definitely dont expect to make a quick trip to the bathroom from anywhere except by the door.  You will be squeezing by and stepping over people, which is annoying for everyone.  I equate the experience with sitting in an economy airplane seat where youre fighting for shoulder space.  Easily they could remove just a few tables and give guests a few more inches of comfort.nnIll stick with my local favorite, Hollywood Improv.  nnI love standup, didnt love this venue."
0,"I have never dealt with such a rude manager before. I called to cancel my account because I had a contract for a six month fee for tanning and was still getting charged the next month. I was confused why. So I gave the store a ring. Apparently because I signed a contract saying I have to come in and cancel it before a certain date there wasnt anything I could do about it. The girl just kept giving me a bratty attitude saying, it was my fault and that I signed the contract. She seriously stated the fact I signed a contract over  times. I understand it, I didnt read the contract all the way through yes, but what I was so taken aback by was the way this girl handled the whole situation. I felt like I was arguing with a four year old girl. She was just ready to get snappy with me the second I answered the phone. Obviously I was confused and just asking a few questions because I really just wanted to cancel my membership and didnt want to drive all the way there. I wasnt looking to start a fight. I will never go back here again because of that. We all get that time of the month sweetie, no need to take it out on your customers."

But lets get down to brass tacks its CRAP! absolutely friggin CRAP!!  For . with tax you get Swiss Miss, ice, and milk thrown into a blender with a little whipped cream on top.  If you think that Swiss Miss, ice, and milk could possibly amount to anything worth that kind of money, not to mention the sugarpacked empty calories, then youre a sheep, an idiot lobotomized sheep who oohs and aahs over anything featured on the Food Network.

0,"I went here recently to see a couple of worldclass singers in the adult contemporarypop genre.  Too bad the venue is run by amateurs.nnThe singers and their bands were outstanding.  I dont fault them, which is why Im not mentioning their names, although when I was playing drums in classic rock and country cover bands, somebody always went out to do a soundcheck before we played.nnOkay, here we go The seats on the floor were small, uncomfortable, and squeezed ridiculously close together.  The acoustics in the place were awful, with a concrete floor and absolutely nothing on the walls to soak up the sound.  The band was way too loud.  The mix was terrible you could hear some instruments while other were barely audible if you could hear them at all.  The lead vocal mics were feeding back.  Finally, and probably worst of all, they pointed the flood and spotlights directly into the audiences eyes frequently and multiple times per song.  I spent most of my time watching the monitors rather than the stage, or just sitting there with my eyes closed.  I wish I could have done the same with my ears.nnI ended up leaving shortly after the second act took the stage.  It was the most dreadful concert experience of my life.  I will happily go see either act play againjust not at Mandalay Bay."
0,"We stopped at Morehead Street Tavern one evening because some friends wanted to meet there they knew the bartender who was working.  We parked behind the building in a deserted parking lot, feeling a little unsafe, unsure if the tavern was even open.  We walked in and sat at the bar.  There were a few other people there, but Im not sure where they had parked.  The way the tavern was layed out, it reminded me of a Western saloon.  And the lighting was low and a bit harsh.  The atmosphere didnt allow for anything exciting to happen other than maybe a barfight or shootout.  So we sat there for a couple of drinks, hung out with friends, received average service sitting at the bar, and left.  There was nothing really memorable about the experience, so I cant say that Id go back."

Meh. I ordered it here about  years ago, it was better that night. Tonight it tasted like red wine, a little fruit juice, and water, as if it used to be iced down, but it melted. My husband agreed. I was going to order a different drink, but the waiter never asked. nnThe meal  we didnt want paella, which is supposedly something they make decently. We got a steak and a chicken breast dish. The steak was fine, not good flavor but edible. My  boneless chicken breasts were perfectly uniform under a mushroom sauce. The mushrooms were sadly just canned, button mushrooms  I expected savory sauteed mushrooms, I got a weird pickled twang. The chicken was WEIRD. Reminded me of institutional cafeteria food, couldnt place it. After two bites, I quit. My husband tried it  they were so uniform because they were like large unbreaded McNuggets  like pressed chicken, we think. GROSS.  The cookedveggies were actually fresh, but sadly doused in so much garlic powder I couldnt do more than a few bites. nnEven though I didnt eat the chicken dinner, no point in asking for a refund, since it was the  of the for although the coupon does charge  gratuity on full price before discount, so the waiter got a couple of extra pity bucks. its gotta suck to serve such bad food. nnSUMMARY I cringe to say this, but that was the worst dinner Ive had in a LONG time.

We were seated really quickly, but sat for at least  minutes, craving water, before our server wandered over.nnI must pause here to just address something that drives me CRAZY when restaurants do not post alcoholic beverage prices in their drink menu, not the servers fault obviously. Do you think by not posting them I will somehow forget that SKYY is more expensive than Taaka? I know it might get people to buy a more expensive drink unknowingly, but we just wanted beer prices. They had draft imports and domestics, and bottled imports and domestics. nnWhen our server came by we practically shouted water! at him and then asked about beer prices. Dear God  for a domestic bottle . for a draft. Im sorry did we suddenly end up on some foreign planet where beer is equivalent to currency? Have you forgotten that we are on a casino floor and that I could therefore go sit at a penny slot for five seconds and receive a free beer? Obviously they cant compete with free, but since I can walk to the Coors factory from my front door, charging me . for sixteen ounces of it is one of the most absurd things Ive ever heard of. Its even cheaper at Red Rocks than here.nnWe order chicken nachos another reviewer talked about their steak nachos, and our server did make sure to tell us that these are different things in that the steak nachos are individually made nachos every one is uniform. The ones we ordered were a huge pile with lots of toppings thrown around. It had a ton of chicken, and was also slightly cheaper. nnWe had to wait at least another five minutes for water. In fact we tried to get some from the bar. when we finally got our water, we drank it and never got a refill. Our food came and the incredibly kind and responsive food runner gave us a refill immediately, which isnt his job. Finally our server gave us one more refill. It took  minutes to get the check after we asked. nnThe food was really pretty good, but I could have probably walked the length of the strip in the time it took to get anything from our server."
0,"We dont have HM in Phoenix, so I have to get my fix when I travel somewhere where there is a store. I decided to make a quick trip down to the HM store at the Miracle Mile shops since I was staying in the Planet Hollywood hotel. Thank goodness I didnt have to go far because it was a really unimpressive store.nnTo start, its not that big. Second, the selection is incredibly lacking. Except for what I bought, most everything was not cute. Third, where were the summer dresses??? All I saw were shirts, shirts, and more shirts. I saw one...yes one...summer dress in the whole store and it was hideous. Fourth, what store doesnt take American Express??? When the cashier told me they didnt accept AmEx, I was stunned. I mean, I know AmEx has high fees, but I think its the first store in three years that I have been in that doesnt take it. Fifth, the layout sucks. nnI appreciate that it was a clean store I had visions that it would resemble Old Navy...picked over and messy, but the merchandise selection was disappointing. Its a . star HM, but Im rounding up to two since I walked away with three cute shirts. If you need your HM fix while in Vegas, go to the one down the street."

0,"We ordered two,  entree take out dinners and one Panda Bowl. On one of the meals we were charged an extra dollar for crispy shrimp which was never delivered. The chicken appeared to be mostly pieces of chicken skin and breading and the Mongolian beef was tough and stringy. Most of the meals were overwhelmed with a very dry rice concoction that was supposed to be fried rice. We also never received any soy sauce so we could at least moisten the rice into an edible state. These were very disappointing meals that cost a total of . that did not include a beverage. It was a waste of money and a waste of time. I would recommend against patronizing the particular Panda Express. Because of our experience here, I probably will not patronize any more Panda Expresses... and let me tell you folks... I am not a very picky guy... but this. place was really a disappointment"

0,"cashier on the day after Thanksgiving one of the busiest movie days of the year.  Line a mile long as you might expect.  No worries we go to the Express Kiosk inside the lobby.  Except that it isnt really Express, and theres a long line here as well and only  kiosk.  Then the scanner to read your Club Card doesnt work so the holds people up even longer trying to get their  points so some year they an get a free Pepsie. Then buying popcorn the scanner doesnt work again.  Then the attendant ignores a request for extra butter and puts on almost no butter.  It really gets a bit comical at some point and I almost start looking for cameras to see if Im on candid camera.  Save the stress and rent a DVD or go to a chain thats cares enough about its customers to hire enough human beings on busy days."
0,"Wow  I dont know whats happened to this place, but it has seriously gone downhill. We were debating ordering some garlic bread, and then remembered our meal came with the complimentary bread, so decided to just go with that. After waiting for about  minutes, our waitress came back to tell us Were still about  minutes out on the bread, so you might want to order some garlic bread if you want bread before your meal. I asked her if we were supposed to pay for bread simply because they didnt have any ready, and she said I guess if you want some, thats your only option. Ummmm how about comping the . garlic bread since it was your error to begin with? Maybe its a small thing but it was SO tacky and they just have a couldnt care less attitude here...Way too many options right in this area to put up with that!!"

0,my review isnt on the decor which is cool and soothing. nor is it about the food which was very tasty. my companions soup was delicious. but it is about the service. i believe our waitress is the owner. from the outset she was really grouchy and rude. that continued into desert where i had to hail her down to order and then she kept saying you want that? i asked her if everything was ok did we have a problem. ill go back again and give it a chance but i didnt have a good time
0,"I went in looking for a birthday cake and was greeted by a friendly helper. She was very nice, and went out of her way to get the cake exactly how I wanted it. They also had lots of cookies, cakes and such that looked awesome. I was offered a sample and politely declined, then thought to myself  Why did you do that. As luck would have it, I spotted a sample plate at the next counter and just helped myself. Apparently, Wayne Newton is a big fan of this location and I had just missed him.nnUpdate I took a friend back here a few days later to show him the wonderful treats available. We were treated like garbage. The lady helping us was rude and annoyed with our questions. I will never return!"
0,Extremely over priced!  Many hard to find items can be purchased at regular grocery stores these days. I kept getting sick from eating their soups only to find out that the bad produce that wasnt sold was given to the chefs along with the old meat to make the fresh soups everyday.
0,"A busy restaurant that makes itself seem so exclusive by crazy wait times.  And when you can get a reservation, dont try and check in a minute before your res. time, they wont accommodate you.nnOnce you get over that, its a great restaurant, however overpriced, tried their jumbo shrimp appetizer, blue corn cakes with duck, and coffee rubbed steak.  The steak, at  was a bit much for what it was considering it doesnt come with sides.  If you want a side thats another .  For  for the main meal, it wasnt outstanding.  But the appetizers, at  a piece, were much better prepared and more bang for the buck."
0,"Wow. Two words that should never be associated with this place Great and American. Most definitely the worst bagel sandwich Ive ever had in my life and absolutely nothing American about it. I was so hungry when my flight landed and a bacon egg  cheese on an asiago bagel sounded like the perfect breakfast snack before my connecting flight. Turns out I payed  for a Walmart quality bagel topped with a soggy yellow sponge, a rubber circle that looked like it should have been sausage, and a slice of cheese that I would have had a hard time giving to my dog. It was a struggle to even put half of the thing down my throat. Next time Ill settle for the squished granola bar at the bottom of my carryon."

As I exited, I noticed mine was the only one on the top rd shelf, next to the pilots. Unfortunately, the top shelf was as tall as I am, I was wearing heels, and carrying a backpack could have toppled forward, if not for backward. I requested help, and the gate agent said I was taller than her. So? I still cant lift my bag from that height, can she please get someone to help me? No luck. I insist on pointing to the baggage handlers, what about them? She igrnoes me nnThe baggage liaison woman then demands I get off the tarmac. Sure! Naturally, I say, as soon as I get my bag, but I cannot reach it. This continues. I lose my cool. It escalates. Finally another woman comes over, and helps me with my bag.

0,"I dined at the restaurant prior to seeing Viva Elvis at the hotel. The restaurant claims to be a Thai restaurant, but it seemed to be more of a fusion. I had order Pad See Ew and received Pad Thai. All of the food tasted the same and the waiters treated us as if they were doing us a favor. The only thing that was slightly average was the wine. I would not recommend this restaurant even if one was looking to simply waste their money."

Later after speaking with customer service on the phone, she told me that I have never gone over  gig and adjusted my plan accordingly.

0,I use to go to Yummy Grill Sushi once a week. I use to love them! But since a few months back Im afraid its gone quickly down hill. We order our items to go and it always takes VERY long. Even on off nights with no one eating there it takes too long. Trust me I love sushi and I have a repect for the art of creating such edible beauties. But it doesnt take  minutes to make popular  rolls. The last  orders weve taken to go were both wrong. I dont live across the street baby I live across town!So you can imagine the unhappiness that comes with going back for the right order!  I wont be eating here anymore. Theyve now lost   a month from me and my family!
0,"The staff needs a lesson on what any social media means.  It doesnt mean just Facebook.  I mention this because there is a posted sign by where you order a burrito, in which any social media checkin gives a free elote.  I luckily had Facebook, but my girlfriend disabled hers awhile back and when she showed her Yelp checkin nearly everyone in the kitchen was yelling, Facebook only!  The younger cashier understood the clearly marked sign and offered to deliver  rightfully earned elotes to our table.  I guess the cashier forgot, so we asked her about our corn, which she said she would bring right out after apologizing to us.  We overheard the kitchen staff loudly asking her in Spanish why two elotes were being given to us...  Sigh, we each got an elote in the end thanks to the cashiers diligence and reading comprehension.nnAnother thing, the price of burritos has gone up.  Our usual order of  burritos used to be  something and now it is  and some change.  I will be looking elsewhere for Mexican food when Im back in Vegas."
0,"Okay I will start by saying that the food was not at all what I was expecting when I made reservations at this restaurant.  Upon arrival, the decor was very nice and I thought I was in for a treat.  Well I was wrong.  nnWe started with a few cocktails, which were good.  We ordered some starters, The Edamame sampler was good and the garlic wasabe edamame was an interesting twist on a favorite, Hot and Sour Soup with Shrimp toast my soup was pitch black, and the shrimp toast was burnt on the outside but mushy on the inside?, and Vegetable Dumplings were overcooked, the skins were mushy.  nnFor entrees we ordered the Fried Rice, Kung Pao Chicken which was basically like Sweet and Sour Chicken at most chinese fast food restaurants, but not fried, Eggplant, and Noodles.  After seeing the food I think the prices are absolutely ridiculous for what they provide.  The food is not flavorful in any way and I definently think that Tao needs to revamp their dishes all of them were unimpressivennAt the end of our meal we did get a dessert which was a sampler of many of their desserts.  I have to say this was definently the highlight of a disappointing meal.  They had a sparkler on the dessert platter when they brought it out and the thing that caught my attention was the GIGANTIC fortune cookie which has white chocolage mousse on one side and chocolate mouse on the other side.  They also had some sort of chocolate cake with a melted chocolate inside, and a fried dessert eggroll.  nnOverall I would recommend for the money you can find much better places to eat in Las Vegas."
0,"If you do have to eat here.... Stick to something basic. They cant even cook a hamburger properly. I have had more of the speciality items and Ive learned my lesson.

We attempted the other room and it smelled the same, looked worn down. Our view from the second floor was an old rundown apartment complex next door. The smell of cigarettes lingered around the property.nnAfter staying at the Biltmore and Four Seasons, this was not a comparison.

I am perfectly OK with waiting in line for check out but when you have  people deep in the two lanes that are open you would think the floor manager would say hey, we need more cashiers. nnWhy do I keep going back?

One quirk that I noticed is they cannot serve alcohol on their outside patio due to a Phoenix law.  I found that curious.nnMy server kept staring at me like I had two heads that morning. I ordered the Sonora burrito that came with hash browns.  I had to ask twice to get the ketchup and it was brought in a small metal container.  Why cant I have a ketchup bottle?nnThe hashbrowns were not cooked all the way through and were kind of gross.  The burrito was tasty but they didnt give enough sour cream to go with it.  Later on either the chilis or the chorizo got me.  So that put me out of commission for a bit.nnIf I lived in Phoenix I might give them another try.
0,"was in there last night with some friends at , place was about  occupied. Sat at the big square table in the bar.

0,"I was really excited to try Noca after hearing so many good things about it. I bought the groupon for it as it was the only way I could afford this place and wanted to go for a late V day dinner with the BF. So we got there and, as others have said, its in a strip mall, but it looks nice enough inside. We were seated and got the big bottle of water. They brought out an amuse bouche to start which was a blue cheese, apple, and nut... thing hard to describe and it was good despite neither of us being blue cheese fans. So I ordered the clam chowda soup to start and it was not so great. It didnt taste like any clam chowder Ive ever had. It just kind of tasted like paprika.. and the potatoes were all thin and looked cute in the bottom of the bowl, but had no flavor as they would have had if they were cooked in the chowder. After the soup they brought a little taste of a parsnip soup. This was the best thing we had all night.... mmmm. For mains I ordered the hangar steak with carrots, broccolini, polenta, and some kind of wine reduction and the BF ordered a pork chop with rice, greens, and celery root puree. My food was good, the steak had good seasoning and the polenta was really good when often it isnt that good. The broccolini tasted kind of weird though... like it was a little burnt. The bfs on the other hand was not so good. The pork chop tasted good at the beginning, but as he got closer to the bone it was basically raw. Like mushy and pink... not gonna eat that. Also the rice tasted dirty and weird. The puree was really good though. So then they brought out the cotton candy which was fine, but not necessary. For dessert we ordered sticky toffee pudding at the waiters recommendation, and it was good. Very different than most desserts, so we appreciated that. So overall the service was really good, creepily good, our water was always full, but the food just didnt impress, especially for the price. nnnThe BF picked up Filibertos on the way home... ha."
0,"The worst Dennys in town that I have been to.  We walked in there was no one to greet us or anything. The employees were all at the corner hanging out by the kitchens door. Our waiter couldnt even do a head count. Basically she suck. Worst waitress ever. She had no clue of what shes doing. She doesnt even know anything about the menu. My friend wanted a chicken wrap, she told him they dont have that. I was ordering and I wanted the build your own short stack with the eggs and stuff. She didnt even let me finish what I wanted to order. My food came I wondered where was my eggs bacon and hash brown. Her ass didnt even write it down or whatever. She then gave my friends each others plates. My friend was like this is a burrito. The waitress responded well thats what they gave me. Freaking idiot gave my friend who ordered the burrito my other friends chicken wrap. The waitress upset me. Erghhh. She then gave my friend a diet coke which he ordered a regular coke. Oh yeah. She didnt gave us any fork knives and napkins. How am I suppose to eat my damn pancakes. This isnt a pancake eating contest. We were all done she put the receipt on the table and told us the check is on the table. Every time time she came to our table she kept telling us the check is on the table. I find that rude. I swear she was on drugs. The manager lady was cool but she didnt help us. If you do decide to eat here try to get the Hispanic lady. Shes really helpful and has been there a long time from what she told us. PEOPLE PLEASE DO NOT GO TO THIS DENNYS. If you want to go to Dennys drive a couple blocks to the one on Dectaur and Tropicana. They give better service. I wanted to add you can smell cigarettes from the casino. Not a good place to bring your children."

He took our order and brought our food then check...no service with our meal.  No drink refills or silverware for our child.  And the wait time to get our food was a little too long.

This was kind of inconvenient because we were carrying around our  week old baby in his carrier too, but we repositioned ourselves at a table inside.nnThe server came over and asked to take our drink orders, but he didnt really greet us at all.  He was not very friendly.  No small talk either.  He was down to business.  It wasnt really even that busy.  nnMy husband had a Diet Coke to drink, but it tasted ultra syrupy.  It must have been served out of the bar hose.  I just had water which was a mistake.  It tasted like Chlorine.  My husband hollered to the waiter who appeared to be in earshot, Excuse me!  Could we please get a bottled water?!?!?  He didnt even turn around nor acknowledge him.nnFinally, when he came back to our table to take our order, we asked him for one, but they dont have bottled water.    nnNext we ordered the food.  We liked our food.   My husband was really impressed with his Build Your Own Burger.  I had a Vegetable Salad which was really good.  The dressing was especially excellent.  It took a while to get our food out, but we really didnt mind because we were distracted by all of the televisions.  This was another plus.  The L.A. Lakers vs San Antonio Spurs playoff game was on.  nnTo summarize, this place really would have gotten more stars had the service been better.  However, it was nothing special compared to the other options North Scottsdale has to offer.  We may be back, but I doubt it.  Probably only if every other desirable option has already closed."
0,"Completed an online order A WEEK IN ADVANCE for a friends birthday party via the Gigis website. When I went to pick up my order in the way to the party, I was old that there was no order for me that they had. It being the end of the night, there were literally  cupcakes left in the store!!! Fuming I asked hat we could as I was literally on the way to the party!! The cashier, who was apologetic and offered a  discount, scrapped up some cupcakes I guess from another order and presented them. Although it was not specifically what I ordered i ordered specific flavors for a specific reason, I took the cupcakes as the alternative was to show up to the party empty handed!! I was informed by the cashier that their bakers have been doing this. I asked for the manager Sergio name and the best time to reach him. I Los left my info so that he could contact me. Almost a week later and no word yet. I have tried to contact him but have been told that he is not in. BUYER BE WARE!! If youre making an order or an event, expect that there is a real possibility that there will be no order for you to pick up when you arrive! Is it more important for Gigis to keep bakers who obviously have no regard for completing tasks correctly, or is it important for them to keep customers??? The jury is still out on that one."
0,"We made a reservation for my pregnant best friends th birthday today for a table of . Keep in mind, shes already emotional to begin with. We get here at PM sharp and wait to be seated... The host then checks his reservation book and says we dont have a reservation set up. I ask him to look again because I made the reservation myself this morning and got a confirmation from the employee. After arguing back and forth for about  minutes, He checks again and then sees the reservation however it isnt made until tomorrow... We then ask wen the next table will be ready and we are told its gonna take one hour to get the table ready...  Oh yeah, and its MONDAY! So I ask to speak to a manager because why should we wait one hour! Isnt that the whole point of a reservation! We shouldnt be punished for somebody elses incompetent mistake !"
0,"Wow, what a disappointment.  Had great expectations because Im a huge fan of Bobby Flay.  The drinks are good, but incredibly overpriced.  for a margarita.  I will say, the duck appetizer was fantastic and I highly recommend it and the side dishes were also good, although  for a pretty small dish.  My big disappointment was my main dish.  I ordered the veal chop, which was huge.  I was so ready for this, but once I cut into it, it was pure fat.  And at  I was sick about it.  After cutting away about half of it, I finally gave up.  Didnt get much to eat.  And our waiter never came back to ask how our meals were, or I would have sent it back.  By the time he reappeared, they had already cleared our plates, so I didnt say anything.  Needless to say, when my  bill arrived, I was not happy.  Dont think I will be returning any time soon."
0,I came here thinking I can get some food cheap and quick but it was the exact opposite. I had the  scoops gelato it was  that was good gelato but too expensive. I had the super dry BBQ chicken at Bar BQ not good at all

0,"Im trying to figure out how such a great place like Mandalay Bay allows this lousy place to survive? This is not what I envision as part of my mLife experience! nnMost items were mediocre, tasteless, too dry, or just frozen food reheated. Desserts? Pitiful.nnI will credit a good waitstaff, but the kitchen staff looked bored. I would be too if I had to serve up this slop.nnMB management how about it? Go sample the buffets at Bellagio, Wynn, and Wicked Spoon. Then shut this place and try again."
0,"Where do I start? nnWith the false hope? The promises unmet?  The astonishing laziness? The lack of understanding of even the most rudimentary customer service?nnLets go back to the beginning. I called the folks here to see if they could replace a cracked screen on an otherwise perfectly functioning HTC EVO G. Meaning I could access all of the phones features, but thought it might be nice to have a fresh, clear screen again. They said, Sure, we can do it for .. I told them to order it. They said I had to come in and pay a deposit of .nnSo I brought it in, paid the deposit.nnProblem   I get a call two days later from a clerk whose voice I recognize as the young man who first took my phone in and assured me it could be done. He said, and I quote verbatim because it is seared into my memory  Hi, I tried to order the screen from our distributor twice and they cant get it. And I dont have time to deal with it.nnWow. I am someone who has worked in retail, with  years under my belt on the floor, facing customers. If I ever said I dont have the time to deal with it, I would have been fired on the spot.nnAfter my initial shock, I told the clerk that the screen is readily available online as I was able to find it in  seconds and for about  shipped to me. I told him this and also expressed my astonishment that after paying a deposit that he would speak to me with such disrespect. He said Sorry, sheepishly and told me hed try. I told him I was not in a hurry and was probably the easiest person on earth to deal with because I understand what a pain in the butt it can be dealing with customers at a service retail center. He was young, maybe , and I thought Id treat him with kid gloves because I dont like to make a scene or cause issues, but I was still so surprised at how easily he was able to tell me he didnt want to deal with my issue.nnProblem   A week later, the screen comes in. I bring my phone in and they tell me to come back in a few hours. I do. The screen is on. I leave, thinking all is good. Over the next  hours, the digitizer goes wonkier and wonkier and slowly recognizes less of my swiping and dialing, and I am unable to use the phone to do anything but fill my pants pocket. nnI call in, explain the situation after sharing with the person the exact issues. He says it could be a faulty digitizer and they could order another one.  I ask if they can expedite it, he says they can but Ill have to pay extra. I inform them that they have not actually fixed my phone and are under original obligation to do so. This clerk turns out to have learned his customer service skills from his colleague, the first one I spoke to. He said I had to pay extra if they had to expedite any process. I ask for the manager and am transferred to a young man who identifies himself as such and also tells me he is the one who personally worked on my phone. I ask him if the information about extra costs for expedited service is true and he confirms it. But he does say that he will personally look at my phone to see whats up.nnI hung up frustrated and we agreed Id bring the phone in for him to assess.nnProblem   The next day, on my planned day to bring it back in, I wake up and my phone has now become a black screen, the wonkiness having been complete. I become very concerned that they have now killed my phone with a bad screen install, but am happy when I hear a preset alarm go off and the phone recognizes my standard downward swipe to shut it off.nnI bring it in and explain the situation to the manager I spoke to, the guy who said he personally worked on my phone I am not naming him so as to personally shame him. I tell him I was able to hear my alarm and thus deduce that the phone itself is fine, but the original repair might have some loose connections. He says fine, well look at it.nnI call back in a few hours, and he says, yes, we were able to fix it. He tells me the tech he was supervising who fixed my phone did not reconnect things securely. I dont remind him that he told me the previous day that he was the one who actually did the work. No biggie, I thought, at least my phone is fixed.nnI go to pick it up and he hands it back to me. I run through the phone and it all looks good.nnThen, as Im about to walk out, he says, Oh, and I wasnt able to get the loudspeaker to work. I tried to fix it like three times and it isnt coming up.nnI tell him it was working that morning, which he knows, and ask him how exactly I am supposed to hear the phone ring? He shrugs his shoulders and goes back to dealing with another customer. I walk out, stunned.  nnNowhere along the line was I offered a discount for the shoddy service, an apology, or even the slightest sympathy that they had been the ones responsible. The franchise owner needs to either send his childrentechclerks to some customer service training or expect that he is going to get a lot more reviews like mine. nnWorst. Service. Ever."
0,Decided to try this place again hoping the lady had a bad day prior. Guess what same RUDE service as the last time! Plus its so hot in here with no air conditioning! Worth driving up to the W. Charleston location. No wonder we were the only ones there!!
0,"My son was a patient of Dr. Vu, and we did see Dr. King once when Vu was out of the office.  Both docs are very friendly, but from my experience, Dr Vu spent very little time with his patients.  The past  appointments we had, the wait was long  min each time.  What makes the visit even LONGER is that a medical student usually visits first, gives your child a full exam, and then you have to wait again for the real doc to visit. When Dr Vu does visit, its lightning speed.  The med student spends WAY more time asking you questions than the real doc, which is disappointing.  nnBad experience on our most recent visit, I went in thinking my  yr old son had croup, told that to the med student and Dr Vu.  Med student kind of believed me, Dr Vu told me it was just very bad allergies and to give him Childrens Allegra.   nights later, I rush my son to Urgent Care at am Goodnight Pediatrics, love them! A and sure enough, my son had croup.  nnWont be back to Anthem Pediatrics...."
0,"Checked in and was happy that I was given  free buffets with my stay.  I used the free buffet for my wife and I, but I of course had to pay for my  kids.  Good thing my wife and I were free cause the buffet was an epic fail.  I also played a few hands with blackjack, and the dealers have zero personality.  I liked the fact that the room started off at  for a special I got early, but to add  resort fee to each night sucked.  I could of stayed elsewhere for  instead, with no resort fee.  Overall, I would say it is an okay stay, but I think Ill look elsewhere next time around."
0,We booked the hotel rooms because it was cheaper. We checked in  rooms are very outdated. It smells old. This hotel needs to update itself. nnIt took us  hour switching between rooms but none of the room was up to our expectation.
0,"Well after seeing a packed parking lot night after night and hearing some good reviews from people we finally checked it out. Unfortunately we left very disappointed. Long story short, service SUCKED, we sat at a table and it took forever to get anything and they forgot things we ordered, the food was mediocre at best and the drinks were weakwatered down. I definitely wouldnt go back. Seems like a place that maybe caters to their regulars and doesnt give a crap about anyone else."
0,"Yuck!! I can only speak about the breakfast buffet but for  plus tip you would think the quality of the food would be a little better. In good Vegas fashion its all flash and no substance. Sure they have all kinds of food,,Chinese, pizza etc for breakfast but the quality of the ingredients is low low end. Bruised fruit, rancid tasting hollandaise, smoked salmon that smelled like old socks and watery coffee. Even the lighting is depressing like they only had money left over for some cheapo neon tubes. I guess if I had been drinking and gambling all night I might have enjoyed this before going to my room to sleep it off. My advice, unless drunk skip this place."
0,"The food was ok. Not very authentic, but tasted ok, and good if you have little kids with simple palates. Service was very poor unfortunately. We waited in the foyer of the restaurant for  minutes before anyone even noticed us. Two members of the wait staff were just hanging out at a booth in the bar. The bar tender saw us but did not make eye contact or greet us. I finally had to go interrupt the two servers who where chit chatting at the bar amongst themselves, to see if they could seat us. There was really no excuse for the poor service. There were only two other families eating in the whole restaurant. Sorry, dont think we will be back. When I go out to eat dinner, I expect good service."
0,"I hadnt been to Rainforest Cafe since I was a kid... I guess there was a reason for that. I went here with work since the students were studying the rainforest and how to behave in a restaurant. The service was sloooow, we were there for about  hours. The food came out far apart...making some of the kids upset. The food itself was nothing special. I had some mashed potatoes and clam chowder. Chowder was like the stuff you get out of the can... the mashed potatoes were ok, but gluey. The main issue with this place are their prices. They are insanely overpriced. You cant get an adult meal for less than  and those meals are basic sandwiches... the entrees were about ... even for pasta.... craziness. Even their entree salads were . I would not come back here."

0,I have been their twice for Karaoke. They have an AMAZING book I was shocked to see how many songs they had.

0,"I REALLY, REALLY, REALLY, wanted to like this place. Lets start w the positive. Nice atmosphere, liked the bar and the fact that we could get mixed drinks, great staff! VERY friendly and helpful! Definitely the best looking Mongolian place Ive been to. Unfortunately you can not eat all the above! If so it would be a  star joint. The food... Well its hard to explain but its not Mongolian BBQ. If theyd have left the mongolian out of the name and just called it Genghis Grill Stir fry, maybe Id feel different. I just expected real Mongolian. I know its a chain restaurant and you can tell they spent some dough in this place. But how do you screw Mongolian up? Its like these cats way over thought the concept? The meat was not good. The veggies combos were all wrong. And the sauces, which a prob the most important part were to thick! Way to thick. I dont care about the metal bowls and the cooks banging the gong when tipped, all I wanted was some descent Mongolian. What they have is way over done corporate over americanized Stir Fry. nApparently you can get fajitas though? All you can eat! What a joke!"
0,"We decided to try based on the good reviews. This place is way overrated, they must be writing their own reviews. I def wont be coming back. We came with a group of   kids and spent  for virtually nothing. The sides were all horrible. The chicken breast was descent, but not for the money. If you want real BBQ go to Lucilles or Charlestons or better yet Texas Roadhouse. I dont know how this place stays in business. What a rip off. Customer service was horrible!"
0,"A steakhouse can not deliver quality steak, which is unacceptable.  Part of the steak was made carbonized, barely edible.   Although the manager took the steak from the check, but the dinner and the whole night were ruined.  Just so disappointed."
0,"The novelty of eating during your movie quickly wears out due to the horrific customer service.

0,"Went with a big group of people on  for a friends birthday and had a terrible experience. The server gave the table shots, strongly implying that it was because of my friends birthday and they would be complimentary, received the bill later and we were all charged  per shot. Ridiculous, since this is supposedly a nice restaurant. Food was soso and overpriced."
0,"First off we walk in and there are open tables everywhere but unfortunately for the young blond hostess the tables outside were dirty. Now it was a nice night out on a Friday and I felt like sitting outside which I requested. The hostess then scoffed, gave me a dirty look, and repeated that there where tables available inside and if we sat outside she would have to clean it first. We eventually got to sit outside...with an attitude. We apparently must have upset someone because we were neglected for about  minutes even though at that time the restaurant wasnt busy. When we did get service it to was with an attitude but the food was awesome. The edamame dumplings were seriously incredible. Now here is where it gets really bad...we gave a card to pay and when we received our receipt back the receipt read . but the copy we were to sign was charging us .. Keep in mind we were a party of just  so the gratuity shouldnt have been added in.  When we pointed out the error no one seemed surprised or particular concerned that we were over charged. They corrected the issue but were so nonchalant about it that we walked away feeling like this was possibly a scam that the staff often tries to run that we were lucky enough to avoid. The moral of this review is to warn you to review your receipts carefully and if you dont want to wait on people you should get out of the service industry."
0,"I must be a big dummy face as I dont get the allure the allure of shopping here. nnI walk in and go to grab a cart... it needs a quarter. Wait what? All I want is a shopping cart.

Thanks for telling me. nnI walk out about to drop my stuff and realize, Aldi, for all intensive purposes made a seemingling simple process of grocery shopping, difficult. I never knew you could bungle up an operation like this. I complain all the time that giant eagles costs are going up.

0,"Im sad to write this review, because Im actually obsessed with Calientes Hawaiian pizza, but the service is so bad I feel that I can no longer give them my business! Every time I order I get the same thing and thats pretty frequent dont judge and every time I call and order they tell me it will be  minutes.... and every time it is late. Last time, the woman who delivered it told me they dropped it and didnt want to give me a bad product ok fair. But, why wouldnt you let me know that or give me some sort of discount since it was so late? If that was the only time this sort of thing happened, I would give them a pass, but they are always late and the one time I went into the actual establishment the service was slow and inattentive as well.

0,"Ive tried just about every BBQ joint here in the Phoenix Metro area  even those who have closed and I can say by far that Chandler BBQ Company is the worst BBQ I have ever tasted in my life.  This place advertised ...meat so tender it falls off the bone.. well, the meat was not tender and it did not fall off the bone.  There was no flavor.  I brought some home for dinner and my family who loves BBQ could not stomach it  we wasted a lot of food that night  had to eat something else right away to get the bad taste of that BBQ out of our mouth. Now that being said, that was my experience, first and last, you may have a different experience if you go.  Im giving it  star because I did not like it at all  very horrible experience.  TAYOR!!!!"

0,"Pretty pastry shops are deceiving. The desserts look great in the display case but for the amount you pay Id say skip it and save your money for buffet instead. A case of  mini macaroons costs  and if you go to Wicked Spoon at Cosmo or Bacchnal Buffet at Caesars Palace you can get unlimited full size macaroons. If youre staying at MGM its conveniently located right next to the elevators as you exit, but Id rather go to Starbucks and get a morning pastry then go to a buffet later. nn    I tried the almond croissant and it was good but nothing special. The coffee was decent too. I also ordered a boston cream pie cupcake but ended up giving it away to the taxi driver. Just because its wrapped in pretty packaging doesnt mean its amazing."

0,"I had always wanted to see the mother of all Cirque De Soleil shows, presumably O at the Bellagio, but tickets were always sold out while I was in Vegas. Somehow this past July  weekend, I was able to get tickets only a couple days before I left home.nnI had seen all other Cirque de Soleil shows in Vegas, such as KA, Zumanity, Mystere, Le Reve, so my expectation for this O show was very high. nnThe stage for O was the most elaborate and beautiful. I give it a star. But the show itself was boring. It was nothing but a bunch of acrobatic performances. Ive seen them all already at the Circus Circus Hotel and Casinominus the water in Vegas and the shows there were free, I didnt have to pay a dime for it. Somehow they perform the same stunts at the O and they charge you  to see it.nnThere were a lot of things going on around the stage while the main act is undergoing. Actors were running around, yelling, singing, dancing but its just to give you an impression that the show is big and the acts are grand but in reality they know the acts are boring so basically they have a bunch of people running around so the audience doesnt fall asleep.nnBasically its nothing but a bunch of boring acrobatic performances in a beautiful theater.

0,"Terribly overpriced drinks   the drink menu does not have any price written, cocktails cost us  bucks plus tax when u will see the bill .  The bad part is even it says the cocktail is a grey goose vodka based .. I dont think the drink actually had any vodka in it for sure ., its just ice and some cheap cocktail mix water .. Beer  nothing on tap  will cost  to  dollar for a bottle or can ., and the club has  drinks minimum ..,., its a terrible place for food and drink ..  min price drinks at the end with tax and forced tips will cost around  bucks and the bad part is its not even any good drink or nice cocktails .. Sound is good.. Seats are too close to each other so u will feel like you are sitting  too close to stranger sitting next chair .. The whole thing is pretty much a overpriced rip off .., nothing compared to a concert like good comedy experience in some real nice venue which will cost not too much than this place .. Will never go here again for sure"
0,"This place... Oh, this place. Kids have fun and thats what really matters...nnThe courses themselves were basically made by some handy man with some  x s, tape, outdoor carpeting, paint, and tons of black lights. It is thrown together cheaply and with little regard to the fun, trick shots that make mini golf fun. There are no windmills or anything else that putt putt is known for. Albeit there are one or two holes with a tunnel or loop... But they are so cheesy! nnIn addition to the course being pure cheese, the people running it arent paying much attention. There is no delay in start times so everyone is holding on top of each other. The front desk should pay attention to that rather than just take peoples money. And theyre not even very good at doing that. I paid and had to ask for our balls and an adult club. The gentleman gave me the third degree because he didnt remember me paying a mere few seconds before. He was friendly, but the lights were on  no one was home, you know? nnYou also have various loitering of teenagers around the th hole. They were literally sitting on the course  the staff or their parents doesnt feel the need to make them move. Of course, the parents would have to be the ones to make them move because there were no other members of the staff anywhere to be found, except at the front desk. nnToo bad my daughter won another free game on the prize hole at the end because I really dont want to ever come back."
0,"I think the Soup Nazi runs the counter service. nnYes, its always good to find a good Jewish deli, especially here in Phoenix. And maybe a little big city attitude adds to the ambiance. But is it necessary to provide such rude counter service? Maybe its cultural? Maybe this place is owned and operated by the Soup Nazi from Seinfield? nnI tried to place a big order for my motherinlaws birthday party. I wanted mini deli sandwiches, mixed fruit salad, chocolate covered strawberries, and mini cupcakes. The guy at the counter told me, in no uncertain terms, that I had it all wrong. You dont want mini deli sandwiches you want whole ones, cut in half. You dont want mixed fruit salad, you want cruditue, you dont want chocolate covered strawberries, theyre too messy and expensive, you dont want mini cupcakes, and you want a regular sized cake. Really??? Then he quoted me a ridiculously high price. So what did I do? I politely told him that Id think about it and quickly went to nearby Frys grocery store and placed the exact order I wanted. I admit that Frys catering food was a smidgen below the deli quality. But given the greatly reduced price half? and the customer service, Im gonna stick with Frys Food Stores. nnGuess its a good thing I didnt try to order soup for the party. Surely the Chompies guy would have scowled and told me, No soup for you."
0,"Seated and had to wait  to  minutes before server came to our table. There was  of us and we ordered appetizers and  bottles if wine. All  of us ordered ribeye steaks. When steaks arrived, the other  were definitely ribeyes. But mine absolutely looked like a New York steak. I asked the busboy who brought my dish if mine was indeed a ribeye. He said yes. I ate a few bites in and knew it was not a ribeye. Our waiter walked by several times without asking how our steaks were but noticed him looking at my steak but no mentioning anything. I finally flagged him down and said this is definitely not a ribeye. He said ok an brought it back to kitchen. Then few minutes later manager came to me and said they are making me new piece of meat. I asked if indeed mine was not ribeye but manager said he didnt know but that my new steak would be out soon. nAll I wanted was acknowledgement that they screwed up and apology. Did not ever get it. Even when waiter came by with new steak I asked him if my old meat was New York steak and he said when it comes to mess ups , he just mentions it to his manager and lets him handle the kitchen and he also said he just washes his hands when it comes to the mess ups. Ridiculous that not one person took accountability and apologized for error. All they said was my new steak would be out soon. Wow. That was total turnoff. Especially when we are staying at the Venetian hotel , it was not representing the experience of the hotel. Bad bad bad.

0,"Ive stayed all over Vegas on the strip and in downtown Golden Nugget, Plaza, and more, this place is the worst!!.  Stayed Thursday, Friday, and Saturday night didnt get any sleep!  There is a band that plays classic rock on Fremont street until am every night. The windows are old and dont offer any sound insulation. Im a heavy sleeper and it still kept me up. I ended up purchasing ear plugs to get some sleep.  Also, our TV didnt work the entire  days we stayed there.  We had a maintenance worker try to fix our TV but it only worked for ten minutes. nUpon checkout we were charged a different rate almost double than what we were quoted from the players club.  The girl working the front desk VANESSA was rude and didnt offer us any assistance with the mix up on paying the wrong price.  She even told me that the TVs in the entire hotel were not working on Saturday only, right after I told her ours never worked, basically calling me a liar. One good thing, when we got back and spoke with the players club they admitted to their mistake and offered us a reimbursement of the higher price we paid. Too bad Vanessa didnt offer to check up on the mix up, we left angry and frustrated. nI will never stay there again and I suggest you stay at any other place in Las Vegas, even motel  would be better since they have a working TV and quiet atmosphere after pm."
0,"First of all i dont like to wait longer than  minutes from the time i order my food to the time i receive it. This is what happened at this Mimis that me and my wife went to on a Thursday night during our first month here in Arizona. It had a New Orleans vibe to it...and happy hour was taking place when we arrived...but the food and service was just average. I cant even remember what i had at the time because they took so long to bring it to me. I am not saying that all Mimis are like this one but be aware my fellow yelpers when you go so you wont be disappointed as well. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my friends!!!!"
0,"Tried the  New England Style lobster roll at the Vegas Foodie Fest  what a disappointment ! No flavor, unless you happen to bite upon a tiny piece of celery, and the lobster meat if thats what it was looked like imitation crab meat run through a shredder. Not a single chunk of discernible lobster meat. Dont know about the orange tarragon butter  tasted like they forgot the orange and the tarragon part. For  I would have chalked it up to just crappy food. For  bucks, its ridiculous. Avoid !"
0,Totally underwhelmed by our first visit here. Slightly embarrassed as we took friends visiting from out of state here. Food was fair. I was afraid it would be cold for as long as it took to get it. They were not that busy for the wait we had with server to get us the bill. We were actually ready to get up an go find him. I guess we were anticipating more since they have been open for awhile to get kinks out. Looks like construction is still going on. I will be hesitant to return.
0,"Good ambiance, great service, comfortable enough, and the prickly pear margarita was delicious! So what gives with the two stars?nnThe food was abysmal! Ive never had worse mole sauce. I wouldnt even call it mole sauce. It was more like black bean paste. Another member of my party had the same dish as I, and we both only ate about half and turned down the offer of the box. And I love almost everything! It was just bland, which is really bad in my book. A person orders mole because they like flavor! No one else in my party complained aloud about their food but neither did I since I was eating for free, but I heard few compliments about anything except the wonderful margaritas. Stick with happy hour at this joint."
0,"Id give a  star if the food wasnt so delicious here. thats why im giving two. nThe service was horrible. came here for a going away party last week and we were sat in the middle of the room at a long table. My boyfriend and I were a little late so we asked the hostess if she sat any big parties, who ever she was texting on her phone was obviously waaay more important then we were so we found our party ourselves. once at the table it took us  minutes to be able to order drinks. I ordered my usual scotch and soda, never being asked what scotch i wanted, but i assumed they would just give me their well scotch. was i wrong about that... but we will go over that once i tell you about our bill.nnour drinks finally arrive about  minutes later, i ordered water as well so i reminded the server when he dropped off our drinks. Our water never came, even after reminding him a rd time.nnThe food was amazing, as usual. We had the heirloom salad, padron peppers, artichoke toasts, ceviche, ahi poke, and we split the spicy shrimp. i obviously took a break from veganism for a night The heirloom salad is freaking amazing, ive never had such a great salad. nnOnce getting our bill, we noticed i was charged for Macallan . For all my scotch drinkers that are reading this, it is a crime to mix Macallan  with soda.. If you cant just drink it straight, just admit to yourself that you are by no means a scotch enthusiast.  And with a price of  i think? a drink, we werent too thrilled. On top of everything the tip was already included, and we werent told this. So for horrible service we ended up tipping double. nnOn our way out the same hostess was still on her phone texting away. If we didnt live in Veer Towers and were so close to this location we would never return. You would figure with all the bad press this restaurant has endured they would step up their customer service."
0,"Maybe its because my friends and I were there earlier in the night, the place was filled with an older crowd, and wasnt full. We came here to get a stamp to get into XS for free which turned out to be a bust, but thats alright. The music was what you get anywhere you go. A mix of top  and house. The drinks were watered down but I guess you cant really complain when theyre free. nnThe main reason for the low rating is because I could not get over the fact that the entire place smelled DISGUSTING! There is a problem when the bathroom of a place smells better than the actual place."
0,"All around bad. It started with the front counter saying no double nonsmoking rooms were available. The person I  traveling with quit smoking so this just wasnt workable. Magically a room opened. Then later another one. The first room looked like no one has vacuumed in awhile and the hall carpets where loose and coming up like the entire floor has flooded floor  North Tower. There was also bad mold in the bathroom. I called the front desk to see if I could at least pay for an upgrade and they sent me to a room that was better but had hair in the shower. Later found the heater does not work during a cold season it was  degrees at night and the shower gets room temperature at best. I wanted to get my money back and leave but there was a big convention and everything is booked.nnThe reason for two stars is location. While loud, it was nice being so close to everything."
0,"Walked in last nite around , sat at bar. Dining room was busy but bar quiet. Horrible service, dirty glassware. Rude bartender. Mushy albacore sashimi, coulda used a straw to eat itnnDidnt order a entree , left"
0,This place is ok. The food is decent besides the overpriced fajitas that had overcooked meat. The main issue is the terrible service. They argue with you on where you sit and had to ask my waitress to stop grabbing with the hostess to do her job. I am currently trying it again and the waitress is exceptionally impatient and seems to not want to be here at all. The only good experience has been the first time we came here and the manager was fantastic and so was the server. How that has seemed to change. The night crew here is terrible.
0,"Me and my wife decided to go to dinner and try something different.   So I picked the Mesa Grill because of the high reviews it had here.  Plus being one of Bobby Flays restaurants, I had high hopes.  We only had to wait a couple minutes to be seated and the hostess was very nice.  I was impressed by the selection on the menu and many items looked good.    I started out with the Tiger Shrimp Tamales and they were very delicious.  I ordered the Black Angus New York Strip Steak in a medium well.   Well when I got the steak and cut into it the steak was barely rare.   We were sitting fairly close to the meat prep station and I had noticed the cook throw what looked like a frozen steak on the grill.   Then he was more focused on the monday night football game on the TV in the sports book.   To me there is no excuse to order a  steak and have it improperly cooked.  I had mentioned it to the waitress and she offered to recook the steak.  I am one not to send anything back to the kitchen because what I have heard they do to return orders.  I figured she would at least mention to the cook that he did not do a good job but she did not try.  Needless to say I was not happy and have definitely had better steaks from a Chilis restaurant.   Overall there was certain parts of the meal that were good but it was truly a disappointment."
0,"I went here for a Birthday party and I was not really impressed. They have an arcade for the kids in the main entrance.  That can be good and bad. I went up to the bar and I started to gamble and I literally had to wait  minutes to get offered a drink. Bartenders were too busy talking to other employees or using their phones. The party was upstairs in the balcony area. In my opinion, drunk people and steep ass stairs do not mix well together. The idea is nice but I am not sure about trekking down those stairs after a couple of beers. As for service I was not really satisfied. Maybe it was because the waitress never came back to take our food order. Maybe it was for the best because when I looked at the menu it was waaay overpriced for what seems to be your typical bar food flair. Two and a half stars  rounded down to two."
0,"This place use to be sushi dans, all they did is change the name.the service is horrible and we were the only ones in there during dinner, guess I know why now. I went in for the AYCE and sake they tried to charge me for the sake, even though they had a sign outside saying it was AYCE and sake. This place is a joke, the sushi isnt half bad but the whole experience killed it.There are way better sushi places in vegas than here, like blue fin!"
0,"CLOSED DOWN nVery disappointed. nDrove way out my way to get there because good creole food has never been seen outside of its native habitat. There was a restaurateur who built in Coconut grove Miami the white elephant of all pseudo NO restaurants. A huge N.O. style mansion,  stories and highly ornate spent several million dollars. The only thing he left out was an authentic chef. It took two years to build and only two months to give up and close its doors."
0,"Friends and Ive always wanted to try this place and finally came around to it. We walked in around pm on a Sunday for some good food.nnAmbience Casual. The interior is very cute, homey but classy, and modern. The restaurant was pretty empty on a Sunday evening, but might have been due to the impending rain. Music was very cute! Overheard that it was s rock on Pandora nnFood We got the spinach artichoke dip, grilled cheese  tomato soup, sliders, and a side of sweet potato fries. The food took slightly longer than expected and came out all at once which we didnt mind since we were sharing everything anyways. Everything was slightly overdone if not BURNT.n Spinach artichoke dip had deeply burnt edges all around and did not taste good at all. The consistency was off, and the pita it came with was deeply burnt on one side and obviously the visible side was fine.n Grilled cheesetomato soup  The sourdough bread was burnt but not as bad as the pita. It was edible. The tomato soup looked and tasted like plain crushed tomato in a can.n Sliders   sliders, looked very cute. I didnt try them, but friends said they were pretty good, meat done right, and was the best menu item on our table.n Sweet potato fries  I pulled the first one out, excited since I have been craving them for awhile, and of course, at the end of the fry was... black. Even the sweet potato fries were burnt. Tastewise they were fine, a bit crispier than normal, but managed to satisfy my craving.nnService Server was fine. No smiles or warm welcome or anything, but she did what she needed to do. As stated earlier, food took longer than expected and was burnt. We placed a good amount of the burnt pita bread that was inedible on the side of the plate. If I was a server and saw that, Id immediately offer to bring new bread, but I mean... people dont all think alike I guess...nnOverall, will not be returning, but perhaps late night is better? Very cute place, sad that it was a fail..."
0,"When our son started here  years ago it was amazing . The instructors were phenomenal and my son really LOVED karate.  They pushed several competitions throughout the year so we decided to train for one and try it.  My son was only  at the time of his first competition.  We paid A LOT of money on top of the already expensive tuition to have one on one sessions to train for competition.  When it came time for the competition we found out they dont send their instructors and we were completely on our own.  EVERY other studio sends instructors along with a team of supporters for their competitors.  We continued to compete, and the kids who represented Sandoval usually ended up with first place wins.  Their training and trainer was amazing, but was often denied permission to attend competitions.  The kids were NEVER recognized for their achievements on their website or Facebook page.  Karate was my sons main passion and now its really fizzled out.  He was in the same class for over  months and had so many youngernew kids join that he completely dominated the class when the sparred.... not in a good way because it didnt make him any better of a fighter.  Sad to see it go downhill so fast but we wont be back."
0,"Im writing this review without even staying at the hotel yet.  I was so frustrated with the whole reservation process.  Ive been to Nobu restaurant in Malibu and totally enjoyed the experience.  Hence, I was excited to try out their first venture into the hotel business.nnI called to make a reservation for a  night stay.  The reservation agent was very helpful initially.  After she told me the rooms and rates available, I selected a double room.  She was able to give me a discounted rate of  per night for the weekend...great!.  She told me that I would receive an email to confirm the reservation at which time I would have to submit my credit card number to hold the room.  I waited and did not receive the email.nnI called the next day.  After talking to numerous agentssupervisors took over  minutes on the phone, they were unable to find my reservation.  They offered to make a new reservation at a rate of  per night.  When I mentioned that it was not the original price I was quoted, they apologized but offered no solutions.  After the whole ordeal, I decided to try another hotel.  nnNobu makes great food..I think they should stick to food business...unless they could improve their service department for the hotel."
0,"Same as the reviews before me  very disappointed. I had purchased a Living Social after being impressed with Jones website. Unfortunately, her customer service was horrible  we never got a chance to see the same quality photos that are displayed on her website. She cancelled, she didnt return calls, she didnt return emails, or texts.. She lacked common courtesy... to the point I wondered if she was just screwing with me?? I dont think Ive received worse service in the online shopping era?? Where most legitimate businesses depend on positive feedback, it was obvious that she did not care. I expected quality pictures, I got disrespected."
0,"Whats worse an excon burger flipper who actually barks at you for your order, a filthy condiment bar, cash only, a cashier that walks up and asks you for your drink order and then walks across the restaurant as he goes and clears a table after he just asked you a question, or the fact that if you dont have cash you get to pay an extra  on top of your  burger to use their cute little ATM machine.nnI KNOW the fact that for some reason people completely overlook it all If you go to ASU, you have to go to Chuck Box! So good dood.nnI was in line, realized I had no cash and began to turn around to go to the ATM up the street. Spatula Master must have noticed that I was about to effup his patty streak before his next Skoal break, and shot me that Ill put  wounds into your torso with this Bic pen look, to which I respond Ill be right back nAnd the response I get OOOK? Whatever!nnReally? OnnI would have left, but I was there with friends  damn.nnThey even have a sign posted claiming that they take cash only because they need to speed up the line. I got an idea how about you employ more than TWO PEOPLE to service your entire restaurant. No? OK, waste my time and my money instead. I get you. Oh but, that cant be so, not if your website statesnnBesides a cold beer and a burger, Ill be here to greet you with a smile and a hug.n Big JuannnBig Juan mustve gotten mugged by the two thugs working the grill at burger number .

Yes they dont take cash, but they dont make excuses, and never would I expect to be greeted with that paintpeeling excon deathstare. And whats with the gimmicky Western decor? Hole in the Wall? The closest reason Chuck Box could be categorized Hole in the Wall Im afraid to eat here because if I piss off Spatula MasterBurger Nazi, hell probably grab that red hot grill and flip it over on top of me... you gotta be mildly afraid to eat at a Hole in the Wall...nnIn all seriousness though, theres no excuse to treat paying customers like theyre wasting your time. Maybe people dont know how to react, or they think that somehow its cool to go to Chuck Box and get treated like a roach. nOOOK? Whatever!"
0,"Forget it! They have some good menu items, but nothing spectacular. It is outrageously noisy on weekday nights with very few patrons. Zipps in Chandler is trying too hard to be a something Mill Avenue bar, when their week night customers are  and yearolds. I expect a noisy bar with loud music on a Friday or Saturday, but who wants to go to a neighborhood bar with your spouse in the suburbs on a Tuesday evening and have to scream over Motley Crue for an hour? nnI did mention the volume level to our waitress and a manager showed up at the table within minutes, but dont be fooled. This was all smoke and mirrors. The manager could care less what we really thought and pulled the old, is the volume okay now trick during a quieter section of the music. He hadnt touch the volume. It was just as loud as it was previously, if not more so. If he wanted to keep the volume at ear piercing levels, he should have just ignored our complaints rather than lie to our faces. nnDrive the few minutes out of the way and go to Devils Advocate! The atmosphere, higher quality menu, and friendly staff are well worth it!"
0,"This hotel was a great venue to hold a wedding reception. There was plenty of parking, service appeared to have run smoothly, and the setting is beautiful. It was also convenient that we chose to take up the couples wedding block deal and just stayed here for the weekend too.nnService from the hotel overall was meh. Most times when I was carrying luggage in and out no one opened the front door, other guests we knew had to contend with broken toilets, malfunctioning sinks, and room changes. Maybe these mechanical issues will be resolved once theyre done painting and renovating? part of the second floor, Im not sure. The pool was nice, though, and its a pretty good location within reasonable driving of some good source of food and shopping."
0,"Rude!  I like to browse and like most of us we dont like to be bothered.  They are very pushy.  Trying to sell sell sell.  If I were to buy, it wouldnt be from them.  I did get an oil change from them, and it was more expensive than what I pay from the dealer.  They also tried to get me to have service done that was not necessary.  Most of my problem is with the floor staff.  Ive walked in a few times with intentions on buying something and left simply because I felt uncomfortable.  Just not a good vibe."
0,"I was so disgusted with the service here, waiting a crick half hour to ask for water, the waiters dont give a crap about you.

I was solo thirsty, what was I to do, get up and ruin other peoples views.? Thats what a waiters for!  nnThis place sucked. Nothing amazing about this theater . Pretty week in.

0,"I was introduced to this pub last night Thursday when I went there to see a friend of mine play and wasnt impressed.  the pubs atmosphere seemed very uncomfortable for me didnt get a great vibe from it. Overall, the pub looks very nice with all the wood floors and a very warm, traditional style of an Irish pub. I will say that the bartender was very nice and friendly however, didnt really know who the waiterswaitresses were so didnt know how to ask for drinks or food when I did eventually sit down. I will also say that if any of my girlfriends go to this pub, I will definitely recommend that they go with friends or at least one other person guy or girl. I was hit on barely  minutes after entering the pub and the guy would not leave me alone nor take no for an answer. my friend playing eventually had to stop in the middle of his songset to tell the guy to leave me alone. The guy was eventually removed from the premise and I was able to enjoy the rest of the night. Overall, my experience at this pub was not the greatest and will probably not be going back anytime soon."

So Im guessing that they put a time frame on when you can pick up your money that there no counting ass cashiers fuck up on if I didnt come back I know they would have pocketed it no good POS.

0,"Came here one morning a couple of weeks ago.  Had about  minutes alloted before my Mayo clinic appointment, so I thought a short stack of banananut pancakes would get me in and out fast.  I thought wrong.  Staff was friendly enough, but it took at least  minutes for the server to finally take my order.  I asked for banananut pancakes, but instead of the pancake syrup not pure maple, I wanted a side of the blueberry compote that usually comes w the blueberry pancakes.  Would this be OK?  Server said yes.  The short stack  cakes arrived  minutes later, but instead of banananut pancakes, these were blueberries, delivered by another server.  My server came by to ask if I needed anything else, heard my complaint, and rushed back to the kitchen to correct it.  I was assured that it would only take  minutes to get a fresh batch out, but another  minutes went by before the correct order arrived.  Keep in mind, its already been at least  minutes since I sat down.  I only had  minutes to spare not enough to savor these delicious cakes.  The blueberry compote ended up containing corn syrup, the ingredient I was trying to avoid by not using the pancake syrup, but its hard for me to resist blueberry compote, so if I must suffer...nnI most likely will visit Chompies again the next time Im out and about and craving for pancakes, but only if I have  minutes or more to spare..."
0,"Burger was bland and expensive. I got the Hells Kitchen burger, which is really just a burger with tomatoes and avocado. I really was hoping for something special here but it did not impress at all. Everyone in my group thought the same, just bland.  for the onion rings, they were good."
0,"Went for a second time on a busy Friday night and had a  minute wait for a table.  nnThe wait was not unexpected, so we expected to order drinks and pass the time.  However, the bar tenders were very unenthusiastic about serving drinks to us.  The two bar tenders made us feel like we were putting them out.  While waiting, we were told to stand in the rear coat rack area.  There are about ten wooden posts for coats and above those posts is a rail with an inch thick line of dust.nnThe dust doesnt end there.nnWe were sat at a booth at the front of the place under a ceiling fan and under an old phone.  The phone above us on the wall is covered in cobwebs and dust.  Each of the ceiling fan blades is covered in dust and that dust and dirt is so thick it is dripping off the sides just waiting to fall in our plates.  nnThe food  average.   Most of us had burgers.  One of us had the open face steak sandwich.  The steak was over charred and under seasoned.

0,"Im not one to put down restaurants because Ive worked in them for about four years, I know its hard. But this place is something else. Im originally from New Jersey, So maybe I was spoiled with great sushi available whenever I want, but to make me feel better, my dad took me out to eat here, because I LOVE sushi. The first time I went there in July, I wasnt impressed. Slow service, and the rice way WAY too salty. I go back from time to time to get a California roll or two, and I asked for spicy mayo to go on the side. They literally gave me a side of hot sauce. I do, however, love their soup and respect them for doing what they do. Ill keep coming here until I can eventually find a better sushi place."
0,"It is a beautiful, but largely unoccupied Japanese restaurant.  We started with potato croquettes   and soft shell crab .  The crab was unrecognizable, overcooked, tasteless and overpriced.

Cigarette butts everywhere inside, trash, vacant window shopping, unfilled water ponds, dust, mold, token homelessmentally ill dude this is the fucking boulevard of broken dreams.nnBy all means go, it will make a good story. The baguette was great and they sell them for  cents. The bahn mi is nothing special. We tried half the menu. I make better bahn mis at home theyre really easy to make and fairly cheap. They dont use mayo but rather the margarine that is one molecule away from plastic. Our group was wondering how they can get away with selling bahn mis at . a pop, and we then joked because rent is probably . If you decide to come, you will see why. You cannot argue with that. The strip mall being in the state it is in...You cant help but feel it is unsanitary even though the storefront looks clean. Les Sandwiches arent bad but theyre not  stars. nnTheres no sign indicating the place exists in the front of the strip mall. ATTENTION HIPSTERS JACKPOT!

0,". for lunch I thought Hey buffet style All you can eat sushi and hot entrees sounds good to me. Totally thought wrong.nnHot Entrees I didnt even touch this, SUPER SUPER Greasy. You could see the oil bubbles. This wasnt Japanese hot dishes more like Americanized fast Chinese Food. nnSushi It wasnt fresh at all Im guessing because they make it then its left out till someone grabs it and they love to pack on the rice, ONLY great thing about this place is they dont care if you eat the rice or not. So I had myself a lot of shashimi. nnSoupUdon Noodles There was a small area were the udon noodles were already preput into bowls and all you had to do was fill the bowl up with soup. The soup lacked flavor, the noodles were were out so long they dried up. Also no good. nnDesert Their selection of deserts were very limited and mediocre, Sorry Mr. Makino I guess I was expecting more? The only exciting this about their desert selection was the fondue chocolate fountain which was a mess chocolate splatters every where. On the floor on the counter every where. Also the strawberries were half frozen still so the warm fondue chocolate quickly turned cold once it touched the strawberries. I like my chocolate strawberries either hardened or warm and meltynnThe place First off this place was disgusting, when I first walked in I couldnt help but notice the floor had bits and pieces of food all over it. When we sat down our table was still wet, Im assuming the waitress just finished cleaning the table from their previous costumers.

Its pretty decent although if youre really into it, theres an exact knock off of this recipe listed on food network. Google it. Youre welcome. nnThe whipped cream on top was delicious, almost my favorite part of the drink. Its about a  ratio iced chocolate drink to cream. Before we dove in, my friend mentioned she should have asked them for no whipped cream. Excuse me? Who are you? nnThe chocolate chips that topped off the drink were not good at all. The worst Ive ever tried but the rest of the drink made up for it. nnAll in all, I tried it and Im done and I have no interest in ever getting it again."
0,"This chocolate shop does not compete to many that I have visited. It is tucked away in one of many corners of Caesers palace so I really dont think its worth an entire trip to visit this shop. I thought the space itself was decorated nicely but the section of pastires wasnt very exciting. They had delicious sandwhiches though but that only because we were really hungry and at  per sandwhich I am sure that only covers the cost of the snazzy packaging they serve it in. Espresso and coffees are good but again, nothing to rave about. nnThey must work on something a bit more imaginative other than a chocolate santa clause mold and the usual tiramisu to impress a visitor."
0,"I dont really eat at Chilis... But tonight we had to go and pay close attention to everything. Cant tell you why, but we had to. The place was nearly deserted on a midweek evening around  or so. As per usual, if youve walked into one Chilis or Applebees, OCharleys, Outback, Olive Garden, etc youve walked into all of them. Nothing surprising there.nnThey sat us down and browsed through their menu. Shitty beer selection but I already knew that. So, I ordered water and a Sam Adams Boston Lager for Becky and I to split since, you know, we still had kids to go back home to.nnThe waitress was nice and serviceable.nnTheir menu had the usual fare. We didnt browse a whole lot. They had some special where you get two entrees and an appetizer for . Of all the things available from that submenu that sounded appealing were the fried shrimp, which I ordered with french fries and cole slaw, and the oz. sirloin, which Becky ordered with a baked potato and steamed broccoli. For the appetizer we chose the corn guacamole.nnThe appetizer came out pretty quickly and it was a very nice  portion I must say. It did not taste like it came from some reconstituted power and the only true complaint, as far as flavor, was that it needed cilantro. Aside form that, it was ok. Not entire sure why they called it corn guacamole as there was hardly any to speak of.nnThe Chips... wow.. those things are a joke and they should be ashamed to call themselves tortilla chips. Doritos have better tortilla chips than this crap. They were paperthing and broke every time you tried to scoop some guacamole or salsa out. They didnt taste horrible... but you couldnt dip them into anything. The salsa was ok as well. Nice and roasty but no heat.nnThen our entrees came. Becky got the better deal out of this fiasco. Her sirloin was nicely cooked mediumrare, her baked potato was pretty standard, topped with the usual goodies and the broccoli was nice and crunchy. Everything on her plate was pretty nice and tasted good.nnI, on the other hand, got a miserable  shrimp on a mountain of soggy fries. They tasted ok, the shrimp did, but I was not happy with the portion I was given.  shrimp  fries and  of my plates real estate went to two ramekins with marinara sauce and sour cream. I barely touched my fries, the marinara was pretty bland and disgusting. Its kinda hard to screw up sour cream from a tub, so that was ok but overall my dinner just sucked. The cole slaw was pretty standard but pretty bland as well.nnMy plate was a prime example of why we dont go to chain, casualdining places. They just suck. Definitely wont be going back to ANY Chilis unless I have to."

0,"I am rating the Low Country Skillet which was ..  This was advertised as cheddar grits with Andouille sausage, blackened shrimp, and eggs.  Others in my party were not as disappointed as I was, but I really was sad about my meal.  The eggs, ordered over medium which is supposed to have a runny yolk and firm white, had very runny whites.  The grits were tasteless .. I had to add a lot of salt and I rarely need to salt anything except eggs at breakfast.  The shrimp was definitely not even recognizable as whole shrimp and definitely not blackened.  The sauce was marginal and pretty spicy even for a Cajuntype breakfast.  I shared a side of pancakes, which was decidedly the best thing I ate, and the Farmer Brothers Coffee was good.  This meal was on Super Bowl Sunday so maybe the cook wasnt paying attention ... but I wouldnt go back.  I couldnt even finish the skillet, and that wasnt because it was too big ."
0,"What did I just eat?nnIm not  percent sure.  Ive been all over America and Ive had sausage gravy over biscuits just about everywhere.  Ive been down South and had amazing sausage gravy.  I had really, really good sausage gravy at a Motel  in Custer, South Dakota no lie!.  Ive had passable sausage gravy and biscuits all over this great land of ours...but what I just ate at the Dairyland Family Restaurant comes nowhere close to being sausage gravy and biscuits.nnThe gravy itself was passable as gravy.  Lifeless and sad, but gravy.  The biscuit chunks in the gravy was where things start to go awry.  They were all uniform in size and shape warning! and they tasted not like sausage, but more like something that was killed out behind the dumpster last night.  Maybe it was raccoon sausage.  nnThe biscuits themselves are where the whole train truly derails.  They actually served that slop over freakin Pillsbury, outofthecan, cook em yourself at home biscuits!  That, my friends, is unforgivable.  If I want that crap, Ill stay home and cook it myself.nnOn the plus side, the service was good.  The eggs were fine.  And the Pepsi I drank was sweet and perfectly carbonated.  nnThe decor of the place looked straight out of  and desperately needs some updating.  nnThe price would be reasonableif they had given me decent food.  At the price I paid for what they gave me, I feel a tad overcharged.nnIm not going back.  Madison is a big town.  You can do much, much better."
0,"When first looking at the website and menu for this restaurant I was not interested in trying it at all. But out friends asked us to dinner with them at this restaurant so felt obliged to go. After looking at the yelp reviews I felt a little better about trying it, though I still had my reservations. nWhen we walked in the place it seemed fine, not too large in size and there were plenty of customers. Every person dinning there was of Asian decent so we thought that the restaurant might be more authentic. You seat yourselves and order at a counter as you would at a fast good restaurant but then the food is brought out to you which we do not know how they remember what goes where because they do not give you numbers. The menus do not have any description of the foodentrees. It dies arrive fairly quickly unless you order their Dinner Special Box, which seemed to arrive  minutes after everyone elses meals.  I did like their crab Rangoon because it wasnt fried to long that the shell was too hard, but my boyfriend disliked how greasy it was. I was also not impressed with their egg rolls and he said they were okay. I ordered their Healthy Option of Chicken and broccoli steamed chicken  veggies with white rice and sauce on the side. It was okay but the broccoli was not cooked enough and the sauce was very bland in taste as was my friends Sesame Chicken. My boyfriend had the Sichuan Beef that had broccoli, bamboo shoots, water chestnuts, and zucchini. I tried a bite of the beef and broccoli and my mouth was on fire! The broccoli holds inabsorbs lot of the spice, but my boyfriend mainly disliked how raw and uncooked the broccoli was. nPrice was fine and the restaurant seemed cleanly enough but Ive had better Chinese. I would not return or recommend others."
0,"Bad service....my friend and I waited way too long. We sat there for an hour. Even customers who came in after us got their orders way before us....our order is not that complicated to cook..I def dont see why it took so long. Finally our food came, but its not what we expected. Average taste. The soup is basically from instant noodle package. Thumb down! Besides, when I asked for some paper napkins, the waitress gave me a poker face immediately...we also had to pour water ourselves. Bad service..I also seriously think the owner is racist. She always smiles at white people but is very impatient with other customers. I would say it is my worst dinning experience."
0,"This is a mixed review.  We were a party of six and some of the food was good.  My wife had the pork chop I tasted a bite and it was really good, as was the mac and cheese.  I had the  rack of ribs that tasted like they were floating in liquid smoke  I ate two small bites and couldnt stand any more of it.  Also i had the cole slaw which was very bland.  The pinto beans was terrible.  I did try the green chile which was pretty good.nnWould I come back here to eat?  NO!"
0,"Me and my husband usually stay on the M Resort for special occasions. On my birthday we decided we would spend a little extra and eat at Anthonys. I guess my expectations were too high, because i left disappointed. nnWe had reservations and were seated promptly on arrival, which was great considering there were only a handful of people in the restaurant for a Friday evening. I was surprised at how long it took for a waiter to greet us and further more disappointed then how long we waited for our order to me taken. nnDover Sole is my absolute favorite fish and is always a treat when we make it at home. I was very much looking forward to enjoying this dish at my visit. It was a decent size portion and garnished nicely, however was absolutely tasteless. I would say that the  was drastically overpriced for what i received. nnMy husband got a steak that was flavored well and cooked to his liking, which made me regret my choice in menu selection even more. We shared the mashed potatoes and asparagus, which were both good and well portioned. nnAfter we completed our dinner they spared no time clearing our plates off the table, but then waited more than minutes for someone to bring us our check. i have no ambition to revisit this establishment in the future and will continue to buy my Dover Sole at the store previously frozen for a reasonable price and better taste."
0,Was not a fan. The steak looked like it had been torn up and twisted into many parts. Looked nothing like what we ordered. The taste was very bland. We both had a horrible time there. Service was atrocious and we felt like we were being treated poorly. We may give them another chance but at the one uptown as I care nothing about going back to this one.
0,"I rented a property through this company first as home lovers and was transferred to homeqwik as my lease was ending.  The house was left in dismal condition for my movein.  The walls and floors were dirty and stained, no screens on the windows, the key only worked on the front door and the other locks had no key, the dishwasher was broken, the air conditioner needed repair, there were no bulbs in the fixtures, property had damage all through the inside, there were bud light caps and cigarette butts all over the backyard, the backyard had broken cinder blocks all along the back and side, fridge was dirty with missing shelving, kitchen had missing shelving and a slanted shelf under the sink that appeared to be installed wrong, among many other things. I left the property in  better condition than when I moved in.   When it came time to get my deposit back I was given a bill for the owner to improve on the house and fix all the things wrong with the property before I moved in.  I am even being charged to shave the bottom of a door that was installed wrong!  Luckily I have video and pictures of the property in the condition I moved in.  I know have filed paperwork with County Meadows for a civil suit to get the money owed to me from my deposit back.  Make sure you take video and a lot of pictures of every square in of any property you rent from them!  I would recommend that you go through another property management company and save yourself a lot of money and headache!  Jason is the property manager for both and this company is very shady!"
0,"When you leave a restaurant unsatisfied you leave a  star review, but when you leave pissed its an automatic one star. Unfortunately, I was a bit pissed when I left. nThe first few times I visited Sugar Factory were great experiences, the service was quick and the desserts were delicious so I felt it would be a great place to end my night with some friends. I was dead wrong.nI didnt catch my hosts name but she was kind and courteous, definitely a good start. Alas, my waitress was nowhere near as kind. She didnt seem very happy about serving us nor did she care about any of the questions we had. She didnt tell me that the menu had been shortened and instead made me feel like I was making up names of desserts Ive had there in the past. Apparently the ice cream waffles dont come with any ice cream they changed it without any notice or warning on the menu, big nono so I agreed to add another  dollars for a pathetic scoop of ice cream on my  waffles, whatever. The food took at least  minutes to arrive, which is completely unreasonable, plus the waitress didnt come by to check on us or let us know our food would take this long.nAs if that wasnt enough, when our desserts came out they were terrible. The ice cream and bananas on my waffles were the only edible parts of my tragic ice cream waffle ensemble. The waffles themselves were much smaller than they used to have and were a bit old and stale. My friends fondue was disappointing at best seeing as how I could find fresher brownies and pieces of cake in the back alley of Albertsons bakery section. nTo top it all off, the waitress charged me  for my  waffles and another  for the scoop of ice cream. It was now time to call the manager, who made up a reason as to why they were charging me extra but eventually waived the pathetic scoop of ice cream fee.  is not a big deal, but its the principle of the matter, Im sure youll agree. nnAt this point I thought we were past the worst of our experience but the waitress decided to prove me wrong by SNATCHING the bill out of my friends hand and SLAMMING it on the table when she returned. She walked off without a word. nI will not be returning here and I suggest the chef sample some of his food before sending it out. nnLong story short, if youre a mindless tourist and you know nothing about good service or food, please visit the Sugar Factory, get screwed on the bill, and leave a great review. Locals arent fooled as easily."
0,"Let me sum up Sweet Cakes for you in two words... over rated.nnMy wife loves this place, and I can see why. The decor is as if the hobby lobby filled head of a molly Mormon exploded inside a hole in a wall restaurant, and the resulting mess that came out was cookies and vinyl lettering surrounded by oil paintings of merchant allies in Paris. If youre into that sort of thing, be my guest. Otherwise, the paint jobs look unprofessional clearly no primer and sloppy lines, the design is inconsistent and the sitting bars by the windows are literally plank boards being held together by vice grips. As hard as they try to design the hell out of this place they did so by cutting corners, and it shows. Very sloppy. nnThat brings me to another point, in what appears to be another effort to pinch every penny, sweet cakes has made a very critical anticonsumer mistake and is now only accepting cash. They say theyre going green which is bull. Getting rid of a credit card machine doesnt do anything to support sustainability, but it sure is a nice way to get people to think youre not actually screwing them when they walk inside.  Alls not lost though sarcasm, seeing as how they only accept cash now, theyve conveniently provided an ATM in their shop that you can withdraw cash from, and wouldnt you know it, its owned by sweet cakes cafe gee, I wonder who gets a cut of that  atm service fee for pulling out cash, nevermind the  your bank will charge you in addition to the atm. It would be one thing if the owners passed on the burden of accepting debit and credit cards to the consumer by slightly raising prices heaven forbid!, but its a whole different thing to profit from the fact that the consumer has no choice other than cash in your establishment. nnI didnt try the deli items here, but from what I saw, Im glad I didnt. The pizza literally looked like the kind you would get from a school cafeteria lunch and the sandwiches didnt look particularly appetizing either. We did try the cookies and I have to say that I was really disappointed. They were too crunchy and hard. The snicker doodle was actually decent, but for the most part I could make better cookies than these at home. The only difference here is that they must use an ice cream scoop when baking them because theyre so huge. Speaking of which, if you go on Saturday they have a buy  cookies get  free sale, and I put that in quotes, because the reality of the situation is that if you buy  cookies, you will not get  additional free. I wanted to buy  cookies and get  free because in my mind, when you say buy  get  free, unless theres a limit stated then it should extend to multiples of two, its just common sense. But when confronted about it, the cashier claimed that its buy  or more and get  free. Thats a huge difference!! If the policy is  free cookie per transaction then it should be clearly stated on the sign, instead, yet again sweet cakes has shown their anticonsumer attitude by their unclear and misleading sale. nnOverall, if Im going to spend  on a sandwich, or . on a cookie, im going to do it at paradise bakery or somewhere that I dont feel like theyre trying to rip me off by selling me sub par goods at higher prices. Im all for supporting your local businesses, but when you can visit a shop once and determine that you dont even want to give it a second chance, youve messed up."

0,My friend brought me here go hang out. Its a really nice place to hang out. It was my first time here and Ive never heard of it. I looked up on yelp to see what was popular. I saw the broccoli cheddar soup seemed to be popular so I ordered that in a bread bowl and I was reallllly craving a strawberry banana smoothie...bit they only had strawberry smoothies so I ordered that. nI dont think this is a good place for me because I HATE bread. The soup was good but not great like everyone here is saying. I couldnt eat the bread bowl it was too hard. The smoothie was delicious but it was  dollars all together. Didnt like that. nNot sure if anything else is great but I dont really like sandwiches either so I doubt Ill ever be coming back. Dont see how its popular or has such a good rating.
0,"In the words of a Jo Dee Messina song, You and me, we had a pretty good thing...IM DONE!  Been going here since it opened, with its ups and downs, but after three bad visits in a row stayed away for months.  Decided to give them one...more...try last night and will never go back again.   It looks like they completely changed the menu and got rid of most of the good things, leaving some really weird sandwiches.  First off, I cant figure out how this place makes regular Grey Goose vodka taste like green apple.   Oh well, that will remain their secret.  My husband ordered a Bleu Cheese Burger and I ordered the Philly Sandwich.  After quite a long wait, he received a BBQ Burger, so I was nearly done when he got the correct order.  All I can tell you about my Philly was it tasted like soggy bread and provolone.   Since I didnt like my vodkagreen apple drink, I ordered something else and received the wrong drink.  So I asked our waitress Sammi or Tammi?  if she was new and she said well...kind of.   So zero tip and out the door and Im sure shes still wondering what the heck she did wrong.   Im sure glad this wasnt a  cover charge night Im reading here for the first time.  What a joke!"

0,"The pros great looking place, feels like you arent in Phoenix. Family ragstoriches story is a great plus. nnThe cons inattentive waiter.

Saw him three times the whole evening, and he left part of the order in the kitchen, we had to flag someone down to get the rest of it. Abondigas soup was lukewarm at best been eating this here for years. The food steadily has taken a dive over the past few years. Doesnt live up to the standards Ive come to expect from the original restaurant. nnReally disappointed. Dont plan to visit again in the future."

0,"We were told great things about the lunch buffet so we decided to try it one day for lunch. When we got there we saw a very nice restaurant but no buffet so I asked the woman at the front specifically if they still did the lunch buffet. To which she answered yes. So, we sat down and waited and waited and waited for a server to come over and finally a man came over to bring us some water. He asked if we had been served and we said we wanted more info on the lunch buffet. He got terrified and said someone else would help us. So, the lady I originally asked about the buffet came over and we asked her for information about it. She then said that they werent doing the buffet for a couple of weeks so they could change it. WTF??? I asked why she specifically said that she had it and she said that she was sorry because she never heard me ask that. THAT WAS THE ONLY QUESTION I ASKED!!! What did you say yes to? How does that even make sense? I dont like feeling like she said what she thought we needed to hear just to get us in the seats. We just walked out after that. Thats a terrible way to do business."
0,"We have just finished a dinner at the Citizen Public House and were still not just feeling like going home yet. Maybe grabbing another drink and a little bite to eat before we go home. It was after pm Saturday night. We naturally strolled around Marcellinos on our way back to garage and I said What about trying this before we go?! Told the hostess we are looking for a drink and maybe a little bite to eat and we would not mind sitting at the bar. She told us nothing is available for another  mins, and she asked if we are going to eat food...?! We said we have already finished our dinner but would not mind to taste a bit of their cuisine and inquired about sitting on a patio or at the bar. There were  or more place seats at the bar while we were not offered either one of these. With quite a sarcastic voice she told us WHATEVER MAKES YOU HAPPY. We have decided to follow her suggestion and left the restaurant   which made us happy."

They promptly referred me to security, who referred me to risk management, who blew me off.  I guess they wont respond unless my lawyer calls.  Craziness."

Very disappointing, and not worth its full price of  which is, shockingly enough, the same as the Rio.nnFirst off, the wait was much longer than expected, and it was largely because the line to get seated was almost as long as the line to pay. I understand that this was a very busy night, but we could see loads of open tables from where we were standing.nnSecondly, HOW ARE YOU GOING TO HAVE A CHINESE SECTION WITHOUT EGG ROLLS? SERIOUSLY. nnThe only above average items in the buffet were the desserts I know, everyone raves about the crab legs at this buffet, but the line for crab legs never seemed to end so I decided to skip it.  interesting things to note about this buffet are that they make and serve cotton candy and they are one of the few buffets in town to serve ice cream andor gelato in waffle cones. You are also allowed to leave the buffet with them. I think I ate more sugar at this buffet than anything as everything else was so mediocre. nnIts also quite possibly the most oxymoronic buffet in town. How are you going to have international stations and yet not even the basics of that cuisine are available see egg rolls for the Chinese section and tamales for the Mexican section. Thank god we grabbed the Buffet of Buffets deal, so at least we can easily make up for this disappointment.nnOur next stop is going to be the Le Village Buffet at Paris. Stay tuned."
0,They really need to work on there customer service whenever you call any of there departments especially aquatics they never pick up the phone I dont understand what is so difficult in picking up a phone and helping a customer VERY DISSAPOINTED
0,"i was way excited when i got a groupon deal for this place.  i live right by it and pass it all the time so i was always curious of what this big ol place was right off decatur and .nnthe food was not great.  we got the cajun grilled scallops to start.  it was just ok  in my opinion it could have used more flavor.  my husband got pasta and it was just drenched in oil.  i got the jambalaya and it was just wrong.  i wasnt enjoying the flavors at all.  i think it was because way too much sauce was mixed with the rice and it was overwhelming.   i only ate a small portion and felt so guilty leaving so much behind.  i do admit that they did include a nice portion of seafood in both dishes which is good to point out.nni wouldnt call it the hippest place to be.  the place was pretty full, but kind of zzz.  the wait staff was very nice and food came out in a timely manner.nnif there ever happens to be a next time, ill try the fried catfish.  i hear they have good happy hour specials so maybe well try that next."
0,"Dont waste your time.  I called for a delivery order, and an hour later, it still had not arrived.  I called back to find out what time the order would be arriving, and I was told that the delivery driver had been out and came back stating no one was here.  Um, yeah.  From the conversation between the employees one answering the phone didnt cover the receiver, so I heard the entire conversation, it was apparent that the order was not going to be redelivered.  If a place cant be bothered to call and find out information even though the information was given to them when the order was placed, its obvious they dont need the business.  That was my first time in trying the place, and there certainly wont be a second.  nnTip  Spend your money somewhere else, because these owners dont seem to care."
0,"I dont really understand all the hype about this bakery. First time we got cupcakes here was on our way to Mt. Charleston last winter, and the cupcakes were just very blah to me. Since we live on the other side of town from retro bakery, there really was no reason to drive up all the way just to try another batch of cupcakes since the first time was just mediocre. We found ourselves on this part of town yesterday since we needed to go to centennial toyota, and I decided to give retro bakery another shot. We bought the retro cupcake, coffee and donut, and the pumpkin spice, and boy, were we just disappointed as last time. As many others have stated, the frosting was too sweet, all you can really taste is the sugar and a hint of coffee flavoring at the end, same goes with the pumpkin cupcake. The cake part was just too bland. It almost tastes like those boxed cake mixes you can buy at the groceries. Not impressed at all. Only saving grace was the service as both girls in the counter were very helpful and friendly. Go ahead and stop by if youre in the area, but not worth traveling to in my opinion."
0,"I ordered bun Bo hue remembering from a year ago how tasty it was. Boy, thing has changed for the worst. Their bun Bo hue was so bland, their broth tasted like it was rundown and the meat was stale furthermore, it was not the correct meat combination  a bun bo hue should have. To sum it up, it tasted nothing like Bun Bo hue. I was very disappointed. However, their service was a four star."

Very disappointing.nMeat was dry and Luke warm, Mac n cheese was old  crusty, fries were soft not crunchy. nAll in all a very disappointing experience"
0,"From the moment we moved in we have had problems with our complex. Our upstairs neighbor plays music at am every morning to the point where it wakes me up every day. The walls are so thin you can hear everything your neighbors are sayingdoing. Also, if you work a ampm job like me and my boyfriend dont ever plan on having any maintenance done. Every time we needed work done I had to take a day off of work. which I really cant afford. There was one time we had asked for maintenance on our kitchen sink because it was draining into the cupboard below. We had given them permission to enter and no one had showed up to fix the sink. We made a complaint and then the next day a maintenance man was there. Instead of fixing the piping he ghetto rigged it into place. Not only did he not fix the sink which lead to multiple phone calls and issues, but he went into our bedroom. The only reason we knew he was in the bedroom was because our dogs had to be kenneled whenever we had repair work done. They are aggressive. We would shut them into our bedroom so they wouldnt bark at the guy the entire time he was there fixing our sink. The day the maintenance man was supposed to be there I came home to an open bedroom door. We still dont know why he thought it was OK to parooze the house why we were gone but we definitely wouldnt recommend anyone letting the maintenance enter without someone being present. Another issue we had is that we needed our bath tub to be repaired. After we had moved in the bath tub started to flake. We havent been able to get any one out here since we need someone to be present to fix the bath tub. Also, whenever we ran the washing machinedryer nicotine would come out of the walls. Yellow ooze would run down the doorswalls whenever they were running. Our apartment is  sq ft and we are paying over  to live here every month. They have also decided to up our rent an additional  if we decided to stay. HAHAHAHA ... no On top of issues with the office the neighbor hood is bad. About a week after we had moved in a swat team was in front of our apartment and I spent  hours outside in the desert heat with two aggressive dogs because we were not allowed into our apartment. We asked the front office what to do and they said tough cookies and went home. There have been multiple drive by shootings and helicopters circling the area when we take our dogs out for a walk. Completely ridiculous! There are two schizo boys that walk around the neighborhood everyday. They make me feel so uncomfortable and my dogs hate them, but what can you really do about that? The management is awful and they treat you like dirt after you sign your  month lease. Yes, we signed a  month lease thinking we were getting a steal on our first apartment! Boy were we wrong! To those of you who still have a chance, find something better. All of our neighbors moved out and there have been less new comers filling the apartments. Lets keep it this way. Apartment number  has had enough.nnAfter posting this comment I received a call from Sydney She is one of the new girls from the company who took over our complex about a month ago. She wanted to address the problems I have been having with the complex. I addressed my concerns with her. This makes me have high hopes for the new complex, but I wont be sticking around to find out how it turns out. The fact that I had even gotten any feedback from our complex at all was a shock a pleasant shock. Good luck to those of you who are going to test the waters."
0,Hey Teavana at Northlake  PLEASE put up a sign about your products containing nuts!  I had no idea tea even could have nuts in it!  But I found out the hard way when a chai I tried at the tasting station had almond flakes brewed into it.  LIST THE NUT INGREDIENTS AT YOUR TASTING STATIONS.  Your corporate office says that youre supposed to do this.  But this was not the case for your MAHARAJA CHAISAMURAI CHAI tea blend.  Thankfully I didnt have an allergic reaction but someone else may not be so lucky.
0,"I havent been all that impressed with Bluephies.  The food was fine, but overpriced for what we received.  I think I paid about  for a salad with grilled chicken.  The decor was interesting but I wasnt really feeling the ambiance.  I stopped by another time for their famous desserts and was again somewhat disappointed.  The cookie dough egg roll, Oreo ravioli, and Butterfinger wontons didnt live up to expectations.  You can get an edible meal here, but the pricevalue equation is a little off."
0,"We got here around noon and most of the baked goods were gone. Matter of fact there was only one croissant left, no chocolate croissants either. nnI just had a small latte, but it was a boring dreadfully dead cup. Aside from the interior decoration of books, mostly French, and a piano I dont see why I would come here again. Once is enough. There isnt even wifi."
0,"Ive been wanting to try Barcelona for a long time, we finally got a group together and made our way there. Staff was friendly and efficient even with our large group. The restaurant is small and intimate.nWe missed happy hour But we had a  off coupon from a mailer. nStarted with a Blood Orange martini...it was delicious, while looking over the menu we were brought complementary toast with hummus and a sweet butter spread.nWe decided to share steak skewers, mac and cheese, and ham and cheese croquets. The steak was yummy, well seasoned and done medium as we had asked a small scoop of mashed potatoes was included, they were a little runny and needed salt but edible with the steak, the mac and cheese was lacking bacon which the menu says is blended in side, we didnt see or taste any bacon. The ham and cheese croquets looked good and werent greasy but were flavorless, again I added salt. My friend had a few different items than we did and agreed the food needed more seasoning. Everyone raved about the bacon wrapped dates.nWe skipped dessert because our friend had brought along cake to celebrate her husbands birthday.nIm glad I got to go and take this restaurant off my list of places to try, I doubt Ill go back, Id rather go to Firefly for tapas  stars."
0,"You know I was super excited to try this pizza, the reviews all say how amazing it is! But.... We tried to use our Discount Dining Dollars, and their pizza restaurant is on there. We ordered the coupons Which by the way costs money! And when we tried to use it, they first said they would honor it, we placed our order and was out the door to go pick it up, they called back within  mins. And said the Owner is refusing to honor it. So were bummed we didnt get to try it! I will say the gentleman that was on the phone was VERY nice and he sincerely felt bad. Not his fault that the owner refused to help.. to bad could have had life long business!"
0,"Okay I must be missing something because I wasnt all that impressed with this place. We are not coffee connoisseurs by any means, but we have a palette that craves more than the crap Starbucks produces. I was super excited to try this place out and it was busy on a sat morning. We got in line and ordering was fairly easy even if the baristas didnt feel like explaining their products. I ordered a mocha and the boyfriend got a regular coffee. His coffee tasted burnt like the beans were over roasted aka like Starbucks does. My mocha tasted off like the milk was turning. Maybe it was an off morning or maybe we have crappy palettes but overall just not impressed. The foam art was generic but well done! I just cant imagine going back again."
0,"If I could give it a minus rating I would.  I was vacationing a few weeks ago in Scottsdale my first time in the city.  We wanted to come in a day early.  We called Hotel.com and talked to the agent.  They told us it was a remodeled hotel with a handicap room with two beds.  When we go there it was not remodeled, a handicap room with  king size bed. It was the worst night I have stayed at any hotel. For the money I paid it should have been a  star experience.  The staff at the first desk was rude and when we asked for other hotel numbers she made sure they were to high in price so we were forced to stay there.  The bedding was spotted so we dont know if the blankets were ever washed.   We got up early the next morning to leave, we didnt stay for the breakfast we just had to get out of there  ASAP.   It was a horrible time and when we moved to the other hotel that we then spent the next three nights in we washed all of our clothing to get the nasty feel of dirt off of us.  Please go anywhere else to stay other than the Days Inn Fashion Square Resort unless you know nasty hotel rooms."
0,"per person omakase was not worth ! nnWe were served the list belownn. Unagi with cucumber and ginger  Very small portion, taste ok.nn. Flounder sashimi  Good fish but overpowered with sauce on top.nn. Caviar with Toro tartar  Caviar was good, but toro couldve easily been tuna, didnt taste like toro.nn. Seafood shabushabu  Good broth, good seafood. The best of the course.nn. Wagu shabushabu  Bland broth, meat was well marbled but was sliced too thick to be in shabushabu.nn. Strawberries with japanese tea  Were paying person for this meal and were served plain strawberries for dessert. WTH?? I can only think of  reasoning. The chef is either  does NOT care of dessert, or  so full of himself that he thinks the main courses were so great that he doesnt want dessert to be too pronounced. Either way, bad judgement on serving plain strawberries.nnRight before we came here, we met someone at the casino that ate here the night before. He said it wasnt worth the money but we decided to give it a try anyway. He was right. Not worth your money. I heard American Fish is better, go there."
0,"I did not have a good experience with this showroom from the very beginning. It started off when the associates at the showroom tried to get my appointment to appear under my existing account on RTR online. The number of times they incorrectly recorded my email address was ridiculous. It took multiple phone calls to straighten out and after a couple days, it was finally listed. This process should take no more than five minutes.nnApproximately a week before the appointment, I received an email from a stylist asking about my preferred styles, colors, size, etc. I appreciated the contact and was looking forward to seeing the dresses she thought would fit me. To my surprise, two days later, I received the same email from a different stylist. I didnt quite understand why I got the extra email I have a feeling its related to the numerous attempts to get my appointment into my RTR account and it didnt bother me too much, but it just added to the bad taste I already had with the lack of system.nnThen, two days before the appointment day, my friends and I all received emails saying our reservation was canceled when we never canceled. The three of us all had to call AGAIN and reschedule.nnThe most disappointing aspect about my experience, however, was the extremely limited selection of dresses in the Vegas store. When I responded to BOTH of the stylists emails with my preferences, I assumed I would be given options that reflected what I had written... I even gave a brandstyle name of a dress from the RTR site that represented exactly what I was looking for.nnNONE of the options were remotely close to what I wanted. I truly do not understand the point of stylists reaching out when absolutely nothing is done with the feedback. I responded a week in advance of my appointment, giving them plenty of time to review my emails. I had filled out a style assessment weeks in advance as well. A professional and honest approach would have been to contact me and recommend browsing RTR online instead because the showroom did not carry anything that was close to what I wanted.nnRTR should use the term stylist loosely and should not advertise them as people who will help customers in personal styling sessions. What a farce.nnI ended up settling with a dress that didnt match my taste as did my two friends. It was something I wouldve never chosen in a thousand years but I had no other choice since my event was the same night.nnI would never recommend visiting the Vegas showroom.nnIf everything above wasnt already enough, I discovered today my credit card along with my home address information has been saved to my RTR account online from when I made the transaction in the showroom. I NEVER authorized this and find it absolutely irresponsible and inconsiderate to the customer."
0,Dont do it... Save youre money for the M resort Studio B buffet it might be off the strip and mins away but its worth it. Spice Market was mediocre and costly for absolutely no selection. I should of read the reviews before going there...Shame on me!!
0,"Do NOT got this place. Im so mad I did not want to tip the man. The nail tech who did my pedicure had a horrible attitude and almost refused to do what I asked! I was only there for  minutes and I saw another tech do it to somebody elsenAnyway, I have dark nails so I like a white base coat so that my colors are more defined, he was so confused and said it wouldnt look right. He put on the base coat and then refused to finish. Then they proceeded to talk about me in Chinese!"
0,"Not really a big fan of used things, but I decided to check it out one night with friends after dinner.  Lots of selections, but its not for me.  At least I can tell my friends that Ive actually been to one.  Good luck if you are a like buying cheap things."
0,"I havent Yelped in awhile but saw fit to tell of my experience here. I ordered edamame that came with a pinch of salt thrown on. Not sprinkled, or dashed. I ask for a side of sea salt and the waiter points me to the salt shaker on the bar. I willingly lick my Palm and sprinkled some salt on to test. Its table salt. I call him back and ask for a side of SEA SALT.... yes, I may have been a bit stern. I finally get that and call him back and ask for a glass of water. Halfway through my beans and no drink service offered. My roll shows up and the water follows right after. Im ignored nearly the entire meal until somebody new appears from the back to ask if everything was ok. At this point I was nearly empty on water and finishing my beans with the sauces in front of me. I asked for more water. After a few passes by, and no water he reached for my plate as he was asking if I was finished. I informed him that I was not and was finishing my edamame. After this, no water served and the check arrives. The saddest part of this review is that I live within ten minutes walking distance and enjoy a stroll to and from meals as it aides in digestion. I wont be returning to this place and the only reason theyve received  stars is because I couldnt quit dipping my edamame in the residual sauces from the roll."
0,"Rudest experience ever! Last time I was here, I had left my dog home and came here only to find others with dogs seated in their outside dining. So, this time I brought my dog. The waiter jumped up on his toes, terrified of my vicious goldendoodle and went in to complain to the manager. He came back out and told me I needed to leave because dogs are not allowed on their patio. I told him that the last time I was here there were dogs sitting here. He was so rude, saying well you have to leave now bye, bye. On my way off the patio, I mentioned that this is now the only business in our area of town where dogs arent allowed on the outside patio and that the apartment community theyre adjacent to is a pet friendly community. Im a vegan so I support vegan friendly businesses. I also have asked the drug reps at my job to cater from Pita Jungle at least ten times this year. I was planning on catering a party in February from here. No longer. No more business from me or my company or our drug reps again, at least at my request."
0,"I want to support Korean business owners in Charlotte. I fucking want to. But I just cant recommend this place.nnA pretty expensive meal without alcohol. . We wanted to do tableside BBQ and had to order two meats to do it. Which is pure radical authoritarian nationalism, man. We chose pork belly and kalbi, the most affordable options I would have chosen those either way, because its bomb anyway, they gave us two kalbi short ribs which I found to be fucking shitty. At least give us four. Most of the kalbi rib is bone, anyway. Theirs was tong kalbi. They should do a flanken cut instead to give the appearance of more food if they dont want to actually give more...food. Also, I think tong kalbi just confuses white people. They dont know what to do with their hands. And those scissors. Really, it stresses some people out. The ban chan is not bad. I liked the soup they gave us as well. nnYou could tell our waiter knew it was overpriced as well, he felt guilty so he ended up bringing us two shots of sochu. Without us complaining.nn I mean, we mentioned it was steep for two people...but we didnt go into full white people complaining mode.nnThis place isnt bad, though. But, two stars means Meh.

0,"I wish I had read the fortune cookie BEFORE I ate here  you will be disappointed with your meal today is what the fortune cookie read.nnTruer words have never been spoken! nnA little backstory I saw this place while I was shopping at the beauty warehouse in the same parking lot, and the big sign that said Lunch Buffett . caught my eye..Chinese buffets are usually pretty affordable for lunch, so I didnt think the price was any indicator of the quality of the buffet. nnnWRONG! nnThis is the first time since  that Ive tried a new restaurant without reviewing yelp first. Why oh why didnt I check the reviews? nnnPerhaps the air conditioner stolen sign see photo should have been an indicator of something. My buffet preview revealed a semidecent selection, but the food was greasy, old, cold, greasy, disgusting, oh and did I mention GREASY? nnI picked up several clean plates that had food debris all over them. The food wasnt labeled correctly, and it just looked sad.nnSpeaking of sad, I learned a valuable lesson before deciding to eat at an establishment, I will ALWAYS check the expressions of the patrons.

0,"Not like it used to be.  I used to come here all the time about  years ago.  I always got the Golden Gate Special Beef, which was a huge pile of beef in a thick red sauce, sprinkled with candycoated walnuts.  I decided to get that again and was disappointed to find a small plate of soggy fried beef in a watery sauce with a few plain walnuts.  My dining companion had the garlic chicken and it was a little slimy.  The crab angels tasted fishy and the pot stickers were more wrapper than filling, so everything was a disappointment.  It definitely isnt as good and its far more expensive than I remember it.  Too bad."
0,"Ordered french dip and the meat was tough and dry. The Aju seemed like it may have been previously frozen, like the stale bread.  Bozena got a burger and it was dry even though it was ordered medium. The fries were kind of crispy a good thing to me, but flavorless.  nnPerhaps this experience was an anomaly or maybe what we ordered is not what this location concentrates on.  When paying for food at a restaurant, I dont always expect it to be better than what I can make, but I do expect it to be satisfying or better than average.  I normally like to leave funny reviews the the only thing funny about this evening was how I ran into the grocery store after dinner to get some dessert."
0,"I stopped by last week to dry clean  items  creamblack dresses and a pair of black mens dress slacks. The drop off process went well and I paid before I left since they offer a prepay discount. The three items was just short of  and would be ready the next day after pm.nnI went to pick up the items two days later, but was told one of my dresses needed to be run through again. I wasnt necessarily happy since I know dry cleaning can be rough on fabrics, but I would rather have a clean dress to wear than one that still appeared dirty. I was able to pick it up Monday after . nnToday I went to pick up my dress and it looked discolored, almost like it was washed in tea. I told the gentleman that it looked strange but that it may have been the lighting in the store. I brought it home and inspected the garment under a few different types of light bathroom, living room, and even brought it outside. Nope, I wasnt crazy, it was obviously discolored a couple of the tags had even turn brown. There was also a black smudge on the shoulder and the clasp at the top of the zipper was mangled. nnI called to ask about why the dress had been discolored I wasnt really upset, it was an even discoloration, I was just curious if it was a process unique to their dry cleaning. They told me that with a few more washes, that the color would fade to become bright and whiter again. They invited me back to wash my garment a few more times, I declined and told them I wouldnt be back, and that I was unhappy with the clasp they ripped apart. The fabric of my dress also seems rougher than when I dropped it off, but Im going to chalk that up to the dry cleaning process until I become more familiar with it. nnI wouldnt recommend this place to anyone, and am still on the hunt for a dry cleaner that wont ruin my wardrobe."
0,"The hotel has a very confusing layout. Had to go to the back of the hotel to mess around with the parking. The parking garage is very small and confusing. The lobby was like entering a set of a s tv show. Mirror chandeliers and out dated carpet. The check in line was very long and they only had  people checking guests in. I requested top floor and only got ! I received . I said there was no way that the room was on the th floor because the building didnt even look like it past  floors. We walked to the elevators which are beyond outdated. Scratched and scrapped up gold walls and Mirrors, doors and floors. I looked at the wall of buttons to push my floor and it had numbers ? With arrows and other room numbers. I pushed  which is where my room was.  Got off and the sign in the hall said th floor but all the other signage says  but clearly we were not  stories high above the Vegas nightlife. It is extremely confusing and makes no friggin sense. Thats all I ever heard the other guests complain about. The room we got was a luxury in the renovated Monoco tower. Renovated is an understatement! I think the last time it was update was in the s. The carpet on the halls was stained. The room doors are an old wood type very dark and ugly. The room was worse. It smells like mold as door are you open the door. The room was certainly not luxury nor updated. The bathroom was terrible. Ugly old s yellow bathroom tile and shower and old outdated bathroom fixtures. The shower head was the worst I ever had in a hotel. Everything in the room was dirty. The rugs the ceiling in the bathroom stains on the carpet. The desk and the pictures looked like it hadnt been dusted in years! The windows were absolutely disgusting and dirty. The view was pretty good except the view of the ugly buildings and dumpsters but overall it was a nice view. The bed was pretty comfortable I was surprised. The fridge didnt work and we had to tell them  times to replace it and they never did! We came one night and there was absolutely no parking! All the garages were filled and even valet was full! The one night we did valet the car it took almost  mins to get the car. And they were very short handed.  I didnt have any change to tip on me except a large bill so I went in the hotel to front desk and asked for change and the older lady told me no and I had to walk to the casino which was on the other side of the hotel to the cage to break it. Really? You cant give me some change? Ill never come back to this place. The casino was horrible. They advertise  blackjack and only have it On  table! Really? And they only had  other BJ tables but the min was . Really? The slots sucked and so did the players club which gave me a. . crappy shirt for joining and spending all my money in their hotel. The restaurants suck and are fast food places. Please update it. You can still have the history and old charm if you just update the dam place! Absolutely the worst! Save your time and energy and stay and play somewhere else!"
0,"I hate to use such a negative description, but this buffet was truly awful.  We stopped here for lunch because we had purchased the  hour pass where you can eat at any M Life property buffet as many times as you want in that  hour period.  Ive been to almost every buffet on the strip and this was the worst.  nnFirst of all the line to get in took about  minutes even though there were only a handful of  people in front of us all because there was one person working and each transaction at the register took at least  minutes.  Lots of people in line just walked away.  One hostess walked over to see how big the line was and deemed it unnecessary to open another register.  And when we finally got seated about  of the restaurant was empty so I couldnt believe they wouldnt want to move the line along quicker and get people in. Even when we left, the place was still empty and the line was still long and moving slowly.nnThe food selection is the smallest of any buffet Ive been to in my life.  There were honestly about  less food options than every other Vegas buffet, and worst of all, there were fruit flies in the salad and dessert bar.  How gross!  The place was just filthy and our server only gave us a drink refill once.  Needless to say, we will never return."
0,First time here. Went to see Christopher Titus. This place is a place for comics to test new material. Comic used cue cards. Paid  bucks to go see him.  drink minimum per person. Took my wife. Totally cool with that. Had  or  cocktails wife had . Expected maybe a  dollar tab for less than a  dollar bottle of whiskey.  bucks! Are you fing kidding me!. Now I know why maybe  people showed up. Never go back there again. What a rip off. I can get full bottle service at that price. If I could id give this place negative stars. Thanks for slapping the bill on the table after the comic is done with his test runs and starts with his good material. Ruined the night. Just wanted to take my wife out for her birthday.
0,AVOID THIS PLACE!!nnThe wings might have been the worse I have ever had.  The wife and I love wings and we could barely choke down  each.  French Dip was dry and tasted like eating a block of salt...Im not even sure how you do that with the dip part but they did.  The beer selection was okay at best...wish Peaks wasnt crowded and I didnt have to look for an alternative.nnThe only way this place has a rating about  stars if if the people that work there or their friends are rating it.

0,"Elite Nail Salon is the name I have been hearing since last one month being buzzed in my ears by my friends. Hype was created and I was made to visit it with them. I thought that it will be a state of the art salon which will consider the hygiene standards needed to meet the present life style along with a humanistic friendly environment which is needed to spare some good time off a stiff and grueling working routine. The decor and ambiance was very eye catching when I entered the salon. But all my awe was shattered when I entered it like any other person without any reception or warm welcome which is an important part of a service. Moreover, I went disappointed when I saw that the working ladies were not less than a robot with no expressions on face and no conversation with the customers. The metal tools being used for manicure and pedicure were not sterilized at any point and were being used on other customers the same way as they were used on the customers coming before. It left me in a shock that such a huge investment has been done to provide unhygienic."
0,"went there last Tuesday.  a group of . Got there early with our bar and nightclub convention passes. at  not to crowded. Saw someone fall down the stairs and remarked how dangerous they look. Sure enough an hour later I fell up the stairs. Trying to find someone to report it has been a nightmare. I am very hurt going to DR,today. The black on black floors are a stupid idea I cant imagine anyone with half brain designing a place like that where people drink. And the ones I fell on had no light. I offered to come the next day and show them the said no. Would not go back there. One of my employees a  yr old girl got confused from dance floor as others have said and ended up outside of club. They refused to let her in or even help her as all her belongings purse phone and the rest of her party were inside. She was outside alone crying and finally a couple helped her let her use a phone to call one of us. She even asked security to just walk her back to get her things and she would leave and they refused. would not recommend this club to anyone."
0,"I should have listened to the other horrible reviews about their slow delivery times. I havent even received the food yet . hours and counting, but regardless of how good the food might be, Im never going to order again.nnGot the food after  hour and  minutes. Cold and mediocre. Never again."
0,"Home of the three dollar tip.nnIf Im paying Vegas prices, I want there to be no limit to the hours something is served. So, if I want sushi in a restaurant that is located in the lobby of the Bellagio, it should be served all night, not until eleven PM.  PM?! Really? Because Im not a Vegas local Im most likely just getting out of a show then, or maybe  of the way into my night. Serve sushi all night...its a good business model.nnHowever, if you do serve sushi, dont put white onion in it. Its totally gross. Maybe the chef was playing a joke on us.nnDinner for two  including a horrible plate of mushrooms and sauce that tasted like something from my high school cafeteria that weird onion roll, and something tempurad, which can never go wrong. nnAlso, the server insisted on reaching our table by maneuvering through a tiny gap between my left shoulder and the wall. It was like someone was sneaking up on my, only they were bringing me my chopsticks. nnIm sure this is a fun place to have a drink we werent given a drink menu but our vodka tonics were watered down. nnEh, you get what you get when you go for convenience in Vegas."
0,"Went for dinner for the second time on the one on craig rd , parking is bad bad  and the food was not so hot . Asked for a chile Verdi  burrito and it looked like a enchilada rolled on my plate . Was bad food  I have had better Mexican food at other places . Wont be going back and also pricey they raised their prices on some dishes that are valued at  or  dollars less ."
0,"Please indicate if the following points are True or Falsenn   You and Matt were really excited to visit True Food Kitchen during Restaurant Week. TRUEnn   Upon arrival, the two of you were happy to be seated promptly without a reservation. TRUEnn   The cheerful restaurant duecor infused you with organic, healthy, and sustainable vibes. TRUEnn  You and Matt really enjoyed sitting outdoors on the cozy patio that was artistically bordered with green grass. TRUE nn   The menus variety of healthy and fresh options initially looked impressive and yummy. TRUEnn   It took your waiter about  minutes to acknowledge your existence after being seated, even though the restaurant wasnt very crowded. TRUEnn   When the waiter finally arrived, he didnt welcome you to the restaurant, introduce himself or even explain the concept behind the menu that Dr. Weil  Mr. Fox created. Instead he looked bored and just wanted to know your order. TRUE nn   Waiters at Applebees have made a better first impression than he did. TRUE nn   The seasoned hummus appetizer, topped with a flavorful Mediterranean mix of Kalamata olives, cucumbers, feta and sliced pearl tomatoes impressed both of you. However the amount of time it took this dish to make its way to your table did not. TRUEnn  It seemed like the entire restaurant staff was playing a game of Guess Who?  waiters kept moronically walking around with food, stopping at different tables and trying to guess who ordered what. TRUEnn   At least  times it occurred so frequently you stopped counting, a random waiter placed someone elses food in front of you, and you had to tell them that they guessed wrong. TRUEnn  You ordered a salad, tofu teriyaki bowl and frozen yogurt with berries. Matt ordered the smoked salmon, steak tacos and flourless chocolate cake. It was healthy, fresh and good but definitely NOT worth the  bill including a bottle of wine. TRUEnn  You both felt robbed. A much more pleasant, faster and cheaper alternative would have been to buy the wine and ingredients from Trader Joes or Whole Foods and prepare this simple meal yourselves. TRUEnn  A snail could have cooked and served your simple meal faster then the  painstaking hours it took your waiter. TRUEnn  The restaurants parking validation is only good for two free hours in the lot  but the wait staff decided to play that irritating game of Guess Who? and couldnt serve your simple meal in less than two hours  so to top it all off, you STILL had to pay for parking, which was beyond upsetting after so many other let downs. TRUE nn   Although you liked the duecor and really wanted to love this restaurant, you dont recommend it to anyone since you have most certainly tasted MUCH better health food. TRUEnnThank you for your responses to these True Food Kitchen statements. We are excited for when you return to enjoy more of our overpriced food and overwhelmingly bad service. FALSE!!!"
0,"My Wife and I stopped in Sunday around noon for a cup of coffee, The lady working in the kitchen area looked up from her tasks and didnt say anything.  We waited another  minutes before the waitress greeted us and referred us to the menu. We waited another  minutes for her to finish gabbing with a regular and decided to leave. While we were waiting the  minutes I noticed the lady in the Kitchen wearing a tank top was sweating and wipped her brow with her hand, then proceeded to finish that customers order... Gross! This is the second bad visit weve had in a row at Tuvalu and we wont have our time wasted there again."
0,I wouldve given them  stars for decent food and great service. But the  star is because as Im eating my fruit bowl I find a long black hair in it. Gross so I called and they offered to remake it but who wants to eat another meal after that!?
0,"Dont go here unless you have a huge pile of money and hate good customer service.nnFood very good. nPortions very tiny I paid  for a half a zucchini. Shameful nWaiter Terrible. Attitude. I tipped him , which I NEVER do because Im such a guilt ridden little baby. nChef This was teppanyaki, but the chef never made eye contact with us. I didnt expect a show but I expected a little character with my meal. again, very well prepared nAmbiance very nice.  nPrice too high for the level of service."
0,"Awful. We went for happy hour and ordered nachos and beer. The nachos were pathetic and made with cheese sauce and a very few pieces of chicken. My sister in law had chicken quesadilla and it had three pieces if chicken. To top it off, they opened the garage doors at , causing the inside temp to be  degrees. When we talked to the manager, he responded there was nothing he could do. Never going back."
0,"My friend was in town  from the mid west where it is below zero temps so I thought I would take him to Rustlers Roost to sit outside in nice weather and enjoy the view.  We arrive around  on Thur night to find out they are not offering outside seating tonight. On such a nice night, no outside seating? really? There was a min wait so we headed to the bar where we encountered a less than happy bartender. This is my nd time here and same rudeness at the bar. I asked for a glass when he gave me my beer and I never got one, same issue last time I was there.  We were seated in min. Our waiter was great. Our order included a hamburger and I got a rib eye. I ordered it med and got rare and there was way more fat than meat. terrible. My steak was not good the last time I was there but thought I would give it another shot. nope, just as bad.  the only food that was good was the corn on the cob, all other food, horrible. The band is too loud. All I could think of is when are they going on break!  another reason why I wanted sit outside so I wouldnt have to listen to that God awful loud music.  Bad choice to go there if you want good food and be able to converse with your friend.  Best thing about the place is the view.  I wont be returning."
0,"I had such high hopes for Meatballz.  nnI visited this location around ish and the place was empty. I ordered the sausage sub which was served promptly but at best it was bland. Actually, I thought they had made a mistake and given me a meatball sub.  Italian sausage meat normally has some character, but this tasted more like breadcrumbs.  nnIf Im in the area again I might give them another try, but I was pretty underwhelmed by the place and the . sub. nnSorry!"
0,"I went here for a good few months. I thought this would be a great deal because I only do spray tans and they have monthly unlimited specials. I must say that the customer service was okay but the pricing and everything is off. If your a person who likes to spray tan, I wouldnt do mystic tanning that they offer. Though it seems like a good deal its better for you and your skin to just do airbrush tanning. Dont rely on my comment if you are a bed tanner, I only did the mystic. Plus sometimes the mystic tanning would my skin turn orangeish! Trust me not a good look for anyone! Even though airbrush is more expensive its so much better for you and your skin and plus airbrush makes you look nice and even! I go to Classic Mobile Airbrush Tanning. But Im sure there tanning beds are great. Hope this helps."
0,The pool was fun! The room was spacious and there was nothing wrong. BUT when I went to shower the drain was clogged! I asked guest services to come up  different nights and nobody ever came. I even checked to make sure the do not disturb sign wasnt hanging on the door. It wasnt and I had to shower with water at my feet ankle high. Ew!
0,"Arrived on a Friday at PM.  A few tables but not busy.  We ordered a bottle of wine Ecco Domani Merlot for  and knew we could buy this at any market for  to .  Overpriced.nnMy date ordered Lasagna  and I ordered the Rigatoni Al Forno . I got the side salad with Parmesan dressing and he the Minestrone.  Bread and olive oil dipping were very good.  The salad was okay but the Minestrone soup, while tasty, had a small bay leaf in it.   When we told our server about this, he said that the kitchen leaves them in and when you get one, its a symbol of good fortune.  What ?????   This is a serious choking hazard and nothing should be in your soup that you cant eat !!!!  How absurd !!!!nnThe rigatoni was a huge bowl but the lasagna, although tasty, was very small and lukewarm at best.  The rigatoni was VERY hot as it was placed in the fire burning oven and was  times the size of the lasagna for less money.nnWe were then given the dessert menu and didnt see our server for  minutes.  While we finished our wine, we put our jackets on and the server came over.   Asked if he could bring us anything else and we said just the check.  If we had wanted dessert, it was too late so where did he go?nnDont know if well go back."
0,"To be honest we did not stay here, we only walked through and gambled. So take it for what it is. This place is enormous, with multiple towers and spokes. Lots of stores. Notable restaurants by famous chefs Bobby Flays Mesa Grill, Spago by Wolfgang Puck. They may be good, but they are not cheap!. Dinner entree at Mesa will set you back , not including salad, appetizer, drinks, dessert. Pizza at Spagos is about . I also did not like the casino because it is incredibly smoky, and the slot machines seem to be set to pay out very infrequently. We simply did not like the feel of the place, although the Roman architecture and decorations are cool. We decided we would not want to stay here."
0,"Extremely overpriced flavorless mexican food. Customer service.,. Ehhhh not so good. I know they pay premium for this location but come on.... At least put meat in your beef. They get two stars because I like the chips yet the burrito and tacos we got were so gross!"
0,"I guess they think you will not see what they actually sent. Lets just  say I was mortified nCheap, cheap cheap.in my opinion  I should have went to the grocery store myself. But it gets better when I called to inquire hoping there was some mistake, trying to give them benefit of the doubt I get a argumentative lady with a foreign accent. I desperately wanted to recoup the money   I felt they messed up. She flatly refused to do anything to make the situation better.       in other words I felt ripped off big time. A honest business person would had made it right but instead chose to go this route well .......Sorry I was forced to go this route nTake the time to put you on yelp and expose your stupid business decision"
0,"Waiting two hours just to get two chairs without a table? No thanks..Ill come back in a few months when the shiny wears off a bit. We had high hopes based on the PHX location, but if youre making we wait two hours to get seated, you should let me know ahead of time that we could end p without an actual table when we get seated. The antipasti at the bar was good, but Ill come back and give a more thorough evaluating. Until then, Liberty Market still wins in service without having actual table service."
0,"Ive gone about five times now for some Sunday lunches and was only pleased once in all those times. nnLike some of the reviewers, Im originally from the north where diners are nice and plentiful but I was looking for a good diner in SC. The food here was always ok to just bland save for their french fries which were always good. The one thing I got that was amazing was a bbq burger that they removed from their menu for some reason.  nnService has always been terrible. Youll stand around waiting to be seated for a long time and by the time you sit the servers take  minutes to greet you and youll only see them maybe  more times from there. The day I had the bbq burger the air conditioner was dripping it dripped on me a few times and their solution was to have their dish boy mop the vent over the customers. A lot of dust came off those vents despite the condensation. nnTheir prices are also a little higher then other restaurants. For the price and quality you might as well go to a chain restaurant."
0,"Was excited to try this place as I am a Toby fan ... Cool atmosphere , BUT slow slow slow service . Dont go in starving !! We waited  minutes to get our food , nothing special ...  burgers and a grilled cheese and fries.  The food was descent , not great enough to go back though.  I can now say been there done that ."
0,"Let me put this out there I love pizza buffets.nnI went to Als on a Friday for lunch.  I was a bit confused when I arrived and no one was at the front desk.  But was soon seated.  The interior is nice  modern looking, but unfortunately this may be where the nice things end.nnMy idea of a pizza buffet Unlimited supply of pizza that you stand up and get on your own.nAls idea of a pizza buffet Your choice of unlimited slices of pizza, ordered  at a time using a order form that you have to give to your waitress.nnTo start out with, I ordered a slice of silcilian pizza, a slice of pepperoni and a slice of buffalo chicken.  I liked the buffalo chicken after I dusted off the carrot slices there were carrot slices on my buffalo chicken pizza, and the silcillian was good but I just didnt like the sauce that was used on the pepperoni pizza.  It was now time to order more pizza, so I had to flag down my waitress, ask for an order form, order more pizza and wait for it to be delivered.  Just an odd concept to me.  I dont think Ill be returning.  Luisas pizza buffet is more my style."
0,"This store has the worst customer service  management Ive ever experienced! For about six months, they had a sign  which was about the size of a piece of notebook paper,  located in the upper, right corner of the front window by the entrance that no bags or purses were allowed in the store. The sign was not noticeable in the slightest,  when you walked in the store, you were immediately greeted with  Excuse me you cant bring your bag in here! Not to mention, you are told to leave your bagpurse in a heap of others on the floor at the inside front of the store by the front window, where anyone could walk off with it on their way out  if you dare question this in any way, youre told by the snotty store manager that if you dont like it, dont shop there,  also, that Dollar Tree isnt responsible if your bagpurse gets stolen.....SERIOUSLY!? Youre not greeted  immediately treated like a thief, they have no secure place for peoples belongings,  cannot seem to fathom why anyone would be concerned about this? Come to find out ,  after speaking to the district manager  the vice president as well  Dollar Tree has NO such policy, that policy was created by the store manager,  her employees were told to enforce it unbeknownst to upper management. What an absolute joke!"
0,"LocationnPretty easy to find. Just pull in and look for the sign.nnInside nPlain, but I didnt expect much.nnServicenI was greeted as soon as I came in. I said I had never been here and asked for suggestions. Pig. Bird. Etc. were the suggestions.nnFoodnI cant say I would rave about the food. The sandwich was OK, but I think it was on par with the buckets of pulled pork that you can buy at the supermarket. It was pretty large, I will give them that. I ordered the coleslaw and it was very dry. I worker later told me that if I liked it with a lot of sauce to just order it that way. Some people might like it as served, but I like it soupy.nnWorkersnYoung people. Nothing against young people but they were just flighty it seemed. The boss, or what I can only assume to be the boss came in close to closing to lock up the chairs. Not to judge, but he didnt say a work to any of the guests and just had his large DJ headphones on. he seemed more interested in bossing the girls around than customer service. Now, I admit, I normally kind of find the managers asking how your meal was to be kind of annoying. However, I found it more disappointing to have a manager figure come in and just be  unconcerned about people eating at his place."
0,"OK, I know the last time I reviewed I said I wouldnt come back for at least  mos. I changed my mind. WISH I HADNT! Anyhow, I ordered at  according to the receipt. . for a beef plate wvegis and a small drink. Got my drink and sat down. Maybe  min later someone yelled my name. A couple that had been there longer than me responded and left with their order.  or  min later the girl that took my order called my name and verified my order. That would have been great except I didnt order a spicy chicken bowl. Even if it was mine Im not sure I would have taken it. The way she was carrying it in the bag was the same way you might carry a book under your arm. If it were a bowl of soup, the bowl would be empty. I told the girl that the other couple with the same name probably has the wrong order. She kind of sighed, set the wrong order on the counter and looked like she was going to get my order. Maybe  min later she looked at me to confirm what I had and was finally going to try and fix it. By that time I told her to forget it and give me my money back. Too bad because I really wanted teriyaki today to. And most of all I wanted this place to be good. I have to bet that whoever is throwing money at this place wondering why its doing so poorly has no clue. Continual screw ups like this really make it seem like this T Mad takes customers for granted. Fool me once.... Departed the premises at .  OH, THE RECEIPTS HAVE NUMBERS, USE THEM!!!!!!"
0,"Brought my folks here from CA. Totally disappointed. Food took over  minutes to arrive, and the order was all wrong. We asked for waters three times and never revived them. I spoke with the manager and she told me Im sorry and walked away. I will NEVER come back. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere with better service and food."
0,"Why in Gods name would a shoe repair shop be closed Saturday?nnI should have known at that point that things were screwed up. My second clue was the plastic fake Louis Vuitton bags for sale, hanging on the wall. My third was when the employee argued with me about what I wanted  namely, for my heels to be resoled with something that gives them a little more grip, because  heels  highly polished floor at work have earned me the nickname of Cripple. I specifically asked that the heel itself get a little something for grip, since that area seemed to be the worst culprit. The man argued with me, saying the heel shouldnt matter. Well, unless you have a secret, big guy, I doubt you have a lot of experience with the treacherous specifics of heels. The fourth clue was when he ran my debit card and the machine ran out of paper and he didnt know if the transaction went through or not.nnWhat?nnWhen I picked the shoes up, I then had to wait while he flipped through the entire days transactions from the day I had dropped the shoes off to make sure the payment went through. Why is this my problem? Why do I have to stand there for five minutes while you do that?  nnAnd then, next time I wore the heels to work, the heels themselves slipped all over on the floor, just like I thought they would. Sure, the ball of my foot was fine, but that wasnt the problem in the first place. So I spent  for nothing. Thanks."
0,"This is not a place you would like to take you pet especially when your pet is sick! I had horrible service while here. Not only did I already feel horrible, sad, upset etc due to my  year old dog being in bad shape but the vet was very rude and unprofessional! She came in for less than  mins and then never came back. But she went into another room where she was talking to the nurse and didnt realize I can here everything she was saying. She refused to give me a quote to get my dog treated and she was disrespecting myself as well as my pet. If I could give less than  star I would but not an option. Instead I took my pet to a different place and they were very helpful. nnAnd another thing that should not be done is you should not be on the phone while your with a patient, if not work related. Vet was speaking of being in jail.. That is not work related in one bit. I just want to make sure people and their pets are receiving the best care. Just dont do it here."
0,"Food was good, I ordered the Teriyaki Beef lunch special. The situation started when I finish my meal and decided to eat the  orange dessert. The taste was not sweet and rather bitter, then I realized the orange was rotten on the bottom, and you can clearly can see it from the outside only when you turn it around. Well, this can happen to any restaurant. I guess the reaction of the waiter was more disappointing than the rotten orange, once I show him my plate he never offer to replace the orange, simply reply with Im sorry about the orange I was not looking for a free meal, I only expected the waiter to care a bit more and asked me if he can replace it. Well... I was charged full price but they got  tip well deserved.nnSuggestion to the restaurantnIf you fell most people dont eat the  orange at the end of their meal, simply add a plastic one just for looks.nnTrain your employees to show appreciation for your customers no matter if they dont order your All You can Eat"
0,"A friend and I ended up accidentally going on a slider tour of downtown the other night. District was our second stop. I was excited to try their sliders featured on happy hour that were described as Wagyu beef meatloaf with root beer ketchup, spicy pickles, and shallots on a rye bun and were inexpensive at only .. Unfortunately, they were not very good at all. They had a very off taste to them... hard to describe... but not juicy or flavorful... I couldnt even taste the ketchup... I dont think there were shallots on it... and when I bit into the slider, the meat was kind of mushy and fell out of the sides... pretty unappetizing. We also had the bacon wrapped dates, which were actually good but its hard to mess up dates wrapped in bacon. My friend had their special cocktail of the day, which was some peach concoction... it was pretty awful, extreme alcohol y taste and generally not pleasant. Maybe their regular menu is better, but I dont think I would come here again to find out. nnnPS When we got there, we talked for awhile and then pulled out our phones to check in while we were waiting... the bartender came over and told us to put our phones away and enjoy each others company. I get that, but I think it wasnt his place to suggest it, especially since he had no idea what we were doing, how long we had been together, or the fact that we were checking in and thats it. I thought it was in poor taste."
0,"I would not go back here....EVER! The woman working the door accused my ID of being fake. She asked for a second form of ID. I pulled what I thought was my credit card out of my wallet, however, the bartender at the previous bar gave me the wrong card! Obviously, this did not help my case. I showed her two more credit cards with matching names and asked if I could go back to the previous bar, get my credit card from the bartender, and come back. She said no and threatened to call the police! I told her that was fine with me I had nothing to hide. Instead, she called her manager over to look at my ID. He sided with her and told me that even if I came back with my credit card, I could not come in because you called my employee a B. I was SO taken aback, because I was not intoxicated and would remember if I called her that name, which I absolutely DID NOT. My friends and I left and went to a different bar. I understand this establishment probably deals with fakes very frequently, but I was extremely disappointed that they were so rude it was uncalled for. Do not plan any parties here, because you arent guaranteed that everyone will get in."
0,"I agree with everything that Max A. said about this place.  nnI went in here not too long ago as some friends really wanted to go for last call.  If you are turned on by watching some pale anorexic looking girl wearing a gas mask dance on a bar, then this place is for you.  If you like bad hair, white belts and crappy tattoos, this is also right up your alley.  I wanted to grab some of the girls in here and just give them sandwiches and some sunshine and tell them that their Daddy did love them.  nnI wont be going back here, its just depressing."

0,"meh!  This place is just ok, if it wasnt for the two free nights offer we would not have stayed here.  This place is a hugemogous resort in desperate need for a rehab.  We upgraded to a deluxe room for  per night, decent but nothing fancy.  Our room was big but rather drab, it had a mini fridge , safe and comfy king size bed.  We stayed in the north tower which had convenient parking on the side.  I doubt I would stay here again unless it was free, there are just so many other better off strip options.  One plus, no resort fee."
0,"To date Ive yet to meet a place that was as disappointing as Daisho sushi. I had went for lunch with two of my friendsco workers. A previous story about the owner had me suspicious enough. However two of us had never been and person number three was willing to give it another chance. Immediately it was evident that communication was lacking in this place. From the kitchen to the waitress. We started off with three waters to drink with lemon. The waters arrived timely, without lemon which I had asked for again. After that it took  minutes to receive them. Lemons that take twenty minutes? Ok...nnThings didnt improve from there. I had ordered yakisoba noodles which again came out in a timely manner. The two sushi rolls I ordered however, as well as the sushi the other two ordered all took another  minutes to arrive. The place was not hugely busy, the food took way too long.nnThat being said, the actual meal was the most disappointing part. If I hadnt eaten the chicken yakisoba Id be caps yelling a review. The yakisoba was ok, not something Id order again but it wasnt bad. The sushi on the other hand was downright criminal. No flavor, yum scallops tasted like nothing and my spider roll had the feint hint of tempura flavor before fizzling out.nnMy friends didnt get any better than I did. Their rolls lifeless, badly rolled. I almost didnt take my left overs with me. Though Im not one to waste food. Best part was one of the rolls which we never received and paid for since we needed to get going. Communication of course was horrible. Between staff owner and cook. We had even mentioned that if the roll wasnt started yet then its okay, we will just cancel the order. The waitress assured us it was coming for  minutes, we left without it.nnSimple point is this, dont come here. Blue fin is in the area. Down eastern and Maryland is yummy grill. Sushimon or Osaka is nearby. Go to one of those places and enjoy the food. This place is sadly run by someone with no passion for what good food is about. A most disappointing of findings."
0,"My husband and I honeymooned in Vegas and stayed at the Aria for four evenings. We were not impressed and wont stay there again. Upon checkin, they couldnt find our reservation and when they did locate what they needed, only had smoking rooms available when we specifically said no smoking. The clerk needed to find out what she could do and brought over a manager which at time this time, both ladies turned their backs to us while discussing the rooms. Eventually they sorted out the issue, whatever it was.  One compliment that I will give Aria is that they did upgrade us to the th floor with a fabulous view, due to the inconvenience.   nDuring the rest of our stay, my poor husband kept being called by my last name each time he had to call for service, and on our honeymoon, that is a bummer, especially when this was the first trip as man and wife and Im taking his name. We corrected them at each opportunity but it was never corrected in their system.  Biggest oops of Aria was no room service after our first evening.  Hubby and I went on a LONG Grand Canyon tour.  We left the hotel at seven in the morning and returned close to ten in the evening and the room was exactly as we left it.  This was the biggest let down of all, in all my years traveling and staying in all types of hotels I have never came back to a messy room. nI will give Aria  stars due to the beautiful rooms, awesome roomy baths and incredible view.  The casino is beautiful, has a sweet aroma which is much different than usal casino smell and the city center is fun.  nI hope that maybe since the Aria is fairly new the customer service will be fine tuned and the little details worked out because it is too pretty a hotel to miss out on, but with the nightly rate, the bar must be raised."
0,"I have been flying Hawaiian Airlines for many years.  Recently, they have changed their seats.  Very uncomfortable.  My butt was aching by the time we got to Kauai.  I thought it was just that flight, but had the same experience over the next four flights!   Then, a friend recently came from a trip to Honolulu and mentioned this same, exact ache from the seats. Its definitely the seats nnTakes them over an hour to get a cup of water or any kind of drink to the passengers, which I have experienced the last four flights.  nnNot sure whats going on with Hawaiian Airlines.

0,"I just dont know what to say except Tony needs a firmer grasp of the American language.nI have no idea why my reservation on the phone just now was so difficult nTony over  over again kept saying for example I need a credit card on file to book the reservation, whereas I would ask him if their company already had one  on file for my fiance, vs. using one to book the reservation. He kept rudely bombarding me wother info and not active listening showed he just wasnt all together in the head. He even claimed to be the manager but, he didnt have a firm grip on the language how could anyone who wasnt paying attention be a manager?!!nnMy point being is not a firm understanding of their policies.. weve been going there for years now...  its that he needs to develop his people skills and learn active listening, and to stay wthe flow of conversation instead of parroting policy. He truly wasted both of our times, just from the fact that he wasnt paying attention.nnAs to the standards of this place for its rates you get what you pay for. They only do the basic for upkeep and sometimes the nonsmoking rooms, people smoke in.nThey employees only do the basics when it comes to actually using their computer system and anything out of the ordinary will be difficult for them. Im pretty sure, that some of them get a kick out of doing less than appropriate helping.nnIf someone can turn me on to another hotelmotel near that has the same rates, Im game... nnhttpwww.avictoryhotels.comphoenix.htm"
0,"Great first impression, but that was all. I was greeted promptly at the bar but everything went down hill after that. I asked for Magic Hat which I saw they had on draft, but they informed me they just ran out of it. Understandable. Then ordered a Blue Moon in the bottle instead. She came over five minutes later with the beer and said she had forgotten. Then she asked if I would like a glass. After I replied yes, I was given a collins glass because they were out of cold pints. At this point Ive had a menu in front of me for  minutes and by the time I was asked what I would like to order I asked for my check and left. BOTH bartenders were too busy taking care of the same group of four people. The menu looked great and the atmosphere was nice, but without good service, and proper inventory, I will not return."

0,Unfortunately after trying bad sushi joints and yes they include all you can eat sushi places I thought that I couldnt eat worse. Well how wrong was my take on that. The absolute no no in sushi is when the raw food isnt fresh. A good thumb rule is if the seafood smells more than usual its probably old. Well thats exactly what I got here. nnThe service was good. BTW they expect you to spend a minimum of
0,"I ate at Somburros for dinner around  or pm.  The place was not too busy.  It was clean and brightly lit.  I was greeted by a nice young lady behind the counter who too my order.  I had the  combo a chicken taco, cheese enchilada, with rice and beans.  With a medium soda the check came to just under .  A small tray of tasty chips was included.  Not cheap.  nnMexican food in Tempe has to be great just to stay in business.  There is so much competition.  So my two stars would probably be three in another town, like French Lick Indiana.  Its a real town without many Mexican food places.   nnThe taco was just ok.  A little on the small side.  The corn tortilla was fried in old oil which gave it a burnt stale taste.  The chicken was tasty, and the lettuce was crisp.  There was a little cheese in there too.  It tasted cheesy.   The enchilada  sauce had a burnt taste and was dark brown.  Im not an enchilada expert but Ive had better.  This cheese enchilada was flat and I could not taste any onions.   The rice and beans were average.    On the bright side the food was hot.  nnI didnt find Someburros to be a very good value.  I have had much better tacos and  enchiladas at full service restaurants for less money.   Im going to keep looking for some great tacos."

0,"Lets start with the positives, the lunch menu is affordable with regular menu items not being very expensive as well. The service was friendly and efficient and the wait to get our food was surprisingly mere minutes less than . Cheap and fast.nnNow the negatives. I ordered the orange beef and what I received did not taste anything like orange beef. The beef looked weird and there was way too much tasteless sauce. While eating I felt that this meal may have been precooked or simply reheated. The tiny roll I got was absolutely tasteless and wasnt given some sauce to accompany it, a first for me.nnThe rice ball and veggies were decent, preheated or not. So I ate that and left half my beef in my plate.nnI didnt feel Pho Modernes lunch menu was anywhere close to authentic Vietnamese cuisine and while I didnt order a Pho or more traditional Vietnamese meal, this didnt meet my expectations. With the handful of Vietnamese places around the area, this could have been better. nnShould have been better."

With my lunch being just butchered, it just put me in a bad mood."
0,Gnarly fast food. The concept is great but the execution is just awful. There was no flavor to the Jade Red Chicken and the tortilla was stale. It wasnt even creative purely drunk food only that it still leaves you unsatisfied. I can take awful food now and then but the place was completely dirty. There was food left on our table that I had to wipe off and there was food all over the floor. the staff just merrily ignored it. Absolutely disgusting. We came home and showered. If I could give it zero stars I would.
0,"Ripoff artists.nn I only used them cuz they were on my cheaper dental plan from Aetna.

They try to sell you this stuff cuz the insurance makes no  from the regular cleanings and they have to make some  somehow, so they fabricate stuff thats not ready to be done yet on your teeth.

I received a body wrap, a massage, a shampoo blow dry and a manicure. The only thing I enjoyed was Brenda who did my body wrap she was awesome! My massage was with tym. He didnt listen to anything I said. I told him I am on my feet all day and I have back problems so I would like him to focus on my back and to please not rub my feet. He did the total opposite. He maybe rubbed my back for  minutes ad did my legs and feet for the rest and the time. Then told me one of my legs were shorter than the other and I should get it checked out. Im sorry but that was so rude he could have tried to say it nicely. The lady who did my blowout was very sweet but my hair was still wet at the roots when I left and the ends of my hair was fizzy. For  I expected so expected something a lot better. Lastly I got a manicure I didnt need more than a buff and polish because I get a manicure once a week anyways. But I saw if I got an upgrade from that I could get a massage in that so I did. If I would have known that massage would have just been putting lotion on my hands I would have not paid the extra. The ladies at the mall do a better job. Needless to say I am extremely displeased with my services here. Besides Brenda Maybe because I am a service provider myself so my exceptions are high. But next time I pay  somewhere Ill make sure its not here."

They were nice about it when I brought them back in and said it would be no charge to fix them. So, I dropped off and picked up again and the same thing happened again with two pairs! I am very disappointed with this place which is unfortunate because everyone is so pleasant each time I come. I will be looking for a new dry cleaner."

I specially described how I wanted it cooked.  I kept asking, since I like it pink but without blood, if that was doable.  I said I would be happy to change order if this might be difficult.  I was guaranteed it would be cooked to order.  It was raw.  They took it back.  I sat there while the other five ate for almost  minutes before it was returned.  It came back burnt on the outside and still bloody inside.  The first bite was so salty I had to spit out.  Didnt take a second bite!

So we decided to take him for his birthday.nnThinking ahead, we showed up at  on a Saturday, just knowing that we would beat the dinner rush. Unfortunately, everyone else appeared to have the same plan. So we were told it would be a minute wait. Unfortunately that turned into something more like  minutes. But it wasnt horrible, since it was a nice day, and the staff was generally good about updating us on the status of the table.nnUnfortunately, since there were five of us, and a very large party arrived just in front of us, encompassing multiple tables and the setup of this location not conducive to larger parties, it meant the only option even at that time was for us to sit at a booth for four with a chair at the end. It was cramped to say the least, and then that was made worse by the fact that we were placed in the traffic lane between the tables of the aforementioned large party. We asked to move, and were given another table that had just been cleared. Clear sailing ahead. Or not.nnJust as we were settling into this new table  now just over an hour after we arrived  a lady approached us, in a relatively nice manner, and asked us to move to yet another table. Please know that it isnt that we had a problem with any particular table, but that we had already been there for an hour, we had been seated and moved once already and initially been told that it would be only  minutes.nnThen we found out that the lady who asked us to move this last time was actually one of the people in the large party that was taking up all the large booths so that we couldnt be seated, and perhaps most importantly, the staff milling about just allowed her to do so.nnSo we left.

0,"I really wanted to like this place because it was close to our hotel and me and the crew got hooked up for free.  It was a Saturday night, we bypass the line and go directly to the bouncer who completely hooks it up and ushers us right in  free of charge.  Once we got inside it was a completely different story.  Its Vegas so I completely expected the normal wasted drunk Vegas crowd, but what I got was a bunch of slobs so drunk they could barely stand.  Upon entry a guy was sitting in the hallway with his head between his legs looking like he was on the verge of heaving that awesome buffet he spent  on.  Next in the main room, the place is a great size, but the dance floor next to the DJ was completely overpacked. nnEveryone knows that the people dont make a club, the music makes a club, so immediately I was excited when I heard that DJ Skribble, was gonna be spinning around midnight.   The music up until midnight was a mix of Top  fused with ElectroHouse which is all good, but the DJ seemed to have a trigger finger and only played about  seconds of the song...HATE THAT!.  Then DJ Skribble was up, its now ...what a complete let down!  The music was just bleh...and it didnt help that the club was swamped with wasted sloppy people, flailing their limbs and singing along Im sure they had a great time!  Needless to say, I stepped in glass twice and decided after the second  year old creep didnt take NO as an answer, it was time to leave by am.  nnProbably wont be checking this place out again, but if you have nothing better to do and you are staying at the MGM...this might be a place you could stop by."
0,"I am drafting this review as I am sitting here waiting for a waiterwaitress. My party of  got sat in a little over  min. We have been sitting for  min with absolutely no service. We asked the hostess to get someone to get to our table and it has been more than  min. I guess when they have a request like that they laugh about it with each other and do nothing about it. Today is Sunday...I cant imagine this place on a FridaySaturday. This restaurant is pretty small with a lot of hostesses and waiterwaitresses but someone everyone fails to get it together.nnFinally, we got to order. They are back ordered on the white chocolate and strawberry frozen hot chocolates. Fantastic. Youd think that the kitchen would be stocked with the large amounts of people that come in for the infamous frozen hot chocolates. We ordered a classic sundae,  original frozen hot chocolate, a mint frozen hot chocolate and an oreo frozen hot chocolate. Our Oreo one didnt come out and we were already finished with the rest so I flagged down our waitress who gave me so much attitude because she forgot to put in the order. Also, we did not get our change back. Guess that was tip. nnThis place is literally on the strip. Great location and a good amount of people but horrible service. If you have a couple hours to waste, come here. The only reason why we came to this place was to bring our friends from Cali and to try the frozen hot chocolate...which was okay. Probably would have enjoyed it better if the service was better? None of us are coming back!"
0,"I ordered a dog bed online and after a month they inform me it is not available online.  nnNo problem.  They sweetened the message with a  percent off which worked for a pair of shoes I found already on sale.  What a deal! I ordered them, got them delivered to the store to find they are too big.  I then asked the manager if I could exchange those for a similar pair, which was about  dollar more.n  nHe set up the order then charged me  dollars.  I asked if I could apply the discount that was offered to me.  He said no because the discounts cannot be used on sale items.  I said I used it on the previous pair of shoes, which were on sale.  He then said he could not do it because then it would be applying it again and again... or something of that nature which made no sense.   nnI finished the transaction not wanting to argue.  I  then realized the stupidity of doing business with someone who obviously does not value me as a customer and went back for a full refund.  nnI realize this seems trivial but from the start he was rude.  If he was friendly and open as most if not all the associates at REI the whole situation would have been different. nnI am returning the other items I ordered on the original order as well. nnCustomer service means everything to me. I can find those items somewhere else. nnIn the past REI has gone ABOVE AND BEYOND to serve its customers.  I am not sure where they got this guy or if he is having a bad day or maybe I hit him wrong. nnIt is too bad I will do business elsewhere in the future.  I do not want to do business where I encounter such attitudes. nn I wanted to add that everyone else I saw in the store today was VERY NICE and a pleasure to do business with.  It is too bad I am not sure what happened with that guy....?"

0,"To be transparent, my stay here was paid for by Interscope RecordsUMG.  However, Ill treat this as if I paid for the room from my own very shallow pocket.  THANK YOU INTERSCOPE!nnFirst, its far from the strip.  Supposedly the hotel has a shuttle, but we couldnt find it even sober.   A cab ride to the middle of the strip will run you about .  Ouch when you do this two or three times a day.  nnSecond,  if youre overeh, I wouldnt stay here.  Its a loud, energetic, young crowd.  The clubs are great.  Lines are super long.  We were able to check out a couple, but they werent for us.  However, everyone waiting in the  person line seemed pretty happy.  nnOur room was nice it was an ADA accessible room  so for this reason I fee like it was cleaner.  However, there was a rather large box empty of condoms left under the bed.  More power to the person who stayed before us especially if the really did need the ADA features we did not.   Average beds, double size, so pretty small.  All this talk about luxury sheets is crazy talk because the Hilton has nicer sheets.  The towels were really nice and the Aveda products almost gave it an extra star. nnService  average.  We waited more than  minutes to check in due to some computer issues.  They offered nothing in exchange for the long wait.  nnOverall,  its too far from the strip to be worth the money.  It also doesnt have enough to keep you from the strip.  The casino is only soso."

Uh, guys, you realize all those buildings surrounding you are  BUSINESSES that close after pmpm?! nI think they finally may have closed due to the poor business practices and poor choice of staffing. Hullo, Ive called three times in the short ride over here and you cant pick up the phone... Hmm, I arrive and find  customers? You have GOT to be kidding me! AND then, the pretty service figures they should keep chatting up the guys around the bar rather than the walkin waving cash  a corporate credit card.... GAH!"

Also, there was no pizza which is one of the signature dishes. The service was very slow. nThe second experience was even worse. The service was slow and bad. We were the first to be in the restaurant and were the last to get our food. The food came cold. The ambiance was weird, from wellknown symphonies to radio station music and shows. It sounded like we were in the gas station across the street. There are some good dishes but it wasnt worth the bad service and weird ambiance. nFinally, this restaurant is defiantly overpriced."
0,So very sad. I was very embarrassed that we even paid money to go in. The dolphins were crowded in small tanks. They were clearly unhappy and bored. They were covered in scrapes and were showing signs of distress. The tanks had no reprieve from the sun and were shallow. Captivity certainly isnt where dolphins belong however I have seen several impressive captive habitats and this is not one of them. The big cats were also in small cages and were lazy. Im not sure if this is their nature or because of their environment. Overall very sad and exploitive.
0,"Let me preface this by saying that I love Chipotle. I eat all the time at my local Chipotle and usually find that my qualms related to Chipotle are due to some particular locations. This location is one of them.nnSo at my local Chipotle, I always order via the app, especially when Im in a time crunch. Its meant to be convenient. Just walk up to the cashier, grab my order since its prepaid on the app, and Im done and out. First thing I noticed when I walked up to the cashier at this particular location is that she saw me, but she ignored me. Look, I understand it was busy, but even at the busiest locations you ask someone who bypasses the line what they want, because more often than not, its just to pick up an order. It took until someone else working there nudged her, looked at me, asked if she helped me, until she asked if I  needed anything. Lo and behold, it took about  seconds for another worker to come out with my bag. I didnt even need a receipt. I dont even care if you look at me that much while making the exchange, I just want my food.nnOnce I did have my food however, it was COLD. It was literally a  minute drive from Chipotle to my friends house and once I touched my food, it was absolutely, devastatingly COLD. I ordered at  AM for soonest available pickup at AM. I got to Chipotle at AM, and subsequently my friends house at  accounting for the fact I was first ignored by the cashier. The point of choosing a pickup time is so that I know its nice and at least warm, and ready to eat when I get it. NOPE, not at this location. I have honestly never picked up a Chipotle order so cold when Ive used the app. nnNow lets talk about the contents of the food. Can you say skimpy on the toppings?! My chicken bowl looked like it was  quarters of the way full. And loaded with beans, barely rice, and definitely barely chicken. My boyfriends  chicken tacos in his opinion did not satisfy his Chipotle craving and was not fulfilling. I understand that this may not be the staffs fault, but the trainer of the staff for this Chipotle location. Trust me. There has been a Chipotle location close to me that used to have the same problem that finally got resolved after so many people complained. nnI went to Chipotle to eat something fulfilling, fast, and familiar, but I have been a Chipotle aficionado for years and this is just one of those locations that needs some heavy tweaking. Nothing against the food, but definitely avoiding this location until they get some things straightened out."
0,"Horrible pharmacy. Very disorganized.  Store not familiar with online refills. Messed up my scrip  times. The head pharmacist Dave got very combative over the phone with me and told me he would fill it the right way as a favor... What?? You never did it right in the first place what favor? I didnt know employees were allowed to speak that way to customers, I guess at this Walmart you can get away with it. Will pick up my prescription but will NEVER be back. Im appalled."

0,"so DISAPPOINTED!!! I was visiting Phoenix from Seattle. I was excited to try Joes Diner and support a local business. Unfortunately, our waitress got my order incorrect, so I reordered. The waitress suggested a subsitution with my original order, which sounded better so I accepted her suggestion. She then brought me the wrong food, AGAIN!! I didnt want to cause a scence, plus I was hungry and my friend had already finished eating.  I tried to eat the item she brought out but I couldnt because it has an ingredient she said it wouldnt come with. Needless to say, I asked for my orignal item. Finally, my breakfast burrito arrived... I was happy and about to start eating when  gentleman approached our table. He said to me, nThe next time you come to our resturant , can you please read the menu.  I WAS SHOCKED!!! I couldnt believe one of the employees was saying this to me. I tired to explain there was a miscommunication between myself and the waitress. I was trying to be diplomatic about the situation and did not want to say she got my order wrong TWICE. This person continued to say all smug and righteous please read the menu the next time you come in because Ive never had a customer return two meals before. At that point, I asked the gentleman if he was the managerowner and he said he was. I then told him, Ive never experienced something like this before. I then told him I was shocked that we were having this conversation. I told him, his approach was making me feel like I did something wrong. He wasnt listening. He continued to smile and smuggly say all I ask is that you read the menu ... he then said this waitress has worked for me for  years and she has never made a mistake. At that point the table next to us said, She got our order wrong too!... nnI really hope that Joes Diner reads this and that gentleman thinks about how he approached the situation. nnI totally understand if an employer wants to stick up for thier employees I applaude that but when the managerowner attacks the customer without understanding the situation, well, I had to post this review. nnI hope the Melrose area gets more restaurants in the area... I would love to support them. ... nnIm so sad that this experience has left a nasty taste in my mouth for Joes Diner.nnOne last note... not only did I receive the incorrect meal  times, I paid the bill for the food my friend ate and the final breakfast burrito. nnThe waitress seemed scared of this gentleman. nI dont know what was going on with her that morning, that caused the mistakes.nI left  her a  tip. nnIm not a jerk.. I worked in restaurant business for many years. nAs those of us who have worked in that industry know when you are dealing with a bad customer AND we know when we are being bad customers... no way was I being difficult. nnAs Im typing this review up, Im still shocked with my experience at this diner"
0,Its been months since the last review  time for an update! .... I like Walmart for selection and low prices ........ the Cave Creek location has headed downhill on both  I use to shop there on a daily basic  until items left the shelve  the associates low paid help  would explain to the best on how they try to keep items on the shelves .... now that the selection  Less .... they seem to have a bigger problem on trying to keep up with the pricing on shelves  price you pay at check out ..... for three months now  the cereal we buy on a weekly basis is different than the the price on shelve ... how long does it take for this store to react? ...... I wish I could see how long .... but not  the last time I asked for a bill correction ..... they could NOT reach a manager to CORRECT THEIR PRICING ERRORS  That leads me to believe many of the shoppers at this Walmart in Cave Creek are over charged on a daily basis.

I told her she should learn what is, its on your menu.i know, that sounded bitchy, I just thought she should better informed. I think that was embarrassing for her to admit that to a customer.nnIced tea was extremely weak. nThe chips come in a huge bucket, that was something i have never seen before, was cool.We did not like either of the salsas, bland.nnThe sweet potato fries were soggy and limp. I had a burger with no bun, the burger had great flavor. I also had a bloody Mary, that was super hot and i like hot but this was really hot."
0,"I would give this location zero stars. Very disappointed. I called ahead of time and asked for a fresh pepperoni deep dish pizza, what we usually get from Little Caesars. I was told theres already some made, I asked again if he could make a fresh one and said what time we would be there to pick up. The pizza I received was dry, burnt, and as if it was sitting under a heat lamp for hours. Very little sauce, just tasted like a big hunk of bread with a cheese stick on top. Please dont waste your time or money and go to another location."

0,"okay so someone recommended this restaurant. I realized that its only in business because they take advantage of the drunk bafoons that crawl in there at  in the morning, settling for anything at that point, to satisfy their cravings. they use theyre huge portions to try to compensate for the ridiculous ingredients they provide. just dont ever taste the nachos we have yet to discover what cheese they used."
0,"well, Im torn between  and  stars for this place. nnIve only ever ordered the UnWicha lettuce wrap that I get filled with turkey, avo, sprouts, onions, hot peppers, and cucumbers. its frigging delicious, with the vinegary peppers adding the perfect zing to the rest of the wich.nnBUT, and this is a big butthey NEVER get my order right. seriously, I have to watch them assemble thiswhile they read it off a piece of paper with hawks eyes, and remind them that No, I dont want tomatoes, and Actually, I ordered cucumber on that. its a right pain in the arse, to be honest. nnto top it off, theres at least one guy there with an attitude problem Im not rude when it comes to ordering, but this dude gives me stinkeye every time I have to deal with him. whatev."
0,"What happened to this place?!?  This used to be my spot for Happy Hours about a year ago and got burnt out on it so started trying new places.  We went back last Friday and the service was horrendous.  Flagging down waitresses, not being told of drink specials and my friend ordered a meal to go and they got it wrong.  I mean we could have walked out waiting for the check and wouldnt have been noticed.  Cant say I will be back anytime soon and if so I will sit at the bar next door at Triple George."
0,"My friend and I literally vomited from the pizza I kid you not. Ive had pizzas throughout the country over  years... This is by far the worst ever!!! Crust is exactly like soggy cardboard. Taste is nasty too! I love olive oil but they take it to an extreme! For the cost of this massproduced garbage, they dont put on much topings either. Asked the server to take it back cause the crust was raw, uncooked, soggy to the point it was falling apart... All they did was heat it some more and bring me the same garbage back! To top off the insult, theyll make you wait an hour for it too! Staff frequently ignore customers. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY AT THIS PLACE!"
0,"It wasnt bad, but I wouldnt consider it good pizza. As a former Chicagoan, it is difficult to find a good pizza anywhere but home. I understand it is supposed to be New York style but the term is so dilluted that it means nothing anymore.nnI will give them another shot. nnGarlic knots were doughy and needed more cheese and garlic. Pizza crust was crunchy on the edge and super soggy in middle. Also pepperoni didnt seem cooked enough, althpugh not a health risk, as a pepperoni lover I lile mine crisp on the edges."
0,"Ive been here twice.  The food is not the issue.  The machines are super tight and the service is not very attentive.  And then after youve dumped your dough into video poker, they hit you with a bill for all your drinks!  YAY!"
0,"I am not one who typically writes reviews, and I am not one who really fusses about my hair too much either, buuuuuuut I think a legit yelp review needs to be done for this place. clearly all the other reviews are friends and family.  nnhere is a brief timeline of how my day went. nn I got there and showed Kelly the girl that was highly recommended from a yelp reviewer  a picture, exactly what I want. she went and got her instructor and they talked about how to go about doing it. they were talking to each other the whole time, not including me in the convo because I gave them a picture, this is what I want, get it done. it was a classy looking ash blonde ombre. nn begin slapping on the bleach without any precision  I mean I literally could have done a better job on myself. No joke nn Finally after  hours time to rinsetone.  she asked me specifically what tones I like I said  NOT orange or golden. more of ash color like the picture. nn look in the mirror in absolute horror as my hair is indeed  bright orange.I then tried to calm myself down by reassuring myself that it is because it is wet and it will look better dry.nn hair is dry and I am in tears because my hair is so ugly and  brassy. nn the main lady I think the manager?  comes over and calms me down telling me she herself will fix it. . I show her the picture and explain what I want.since apparently a picture is not enough  I want it NATURAL looking. I emphasized natural about ten times. nn after making me wait a half hour they finally come with the second batch of dye. to cool it down she grabbed what they called  over  or something. I did not know what color she was doing I just trusted her judgment as she is the manager and she knows what she is doing...right? nn finally done with the second attempt and the moment I looked in the mirror I regret saying anything the first go round, because my hair  was much worse than before. that beautiful  over  color was actually just another way of saying pitch black, and the bottom  was platinum. kruella devil is the only way I can describe it. I must say at least kruella devil has a straight line between black and white. My hair has streaks where the foil was placed it was patchy kind of like tiger stripes.  I have no idea how to fix my hair now,  because they completely fried my hair in trying to fix the problem. the lady was pulling out large chucks of blonde hair as she combed it, and then tried to hide it so I couldnt see....  I really wish I could upload a picture, it is awful!!!  the worst part is they knew it looked bad both times, they tried to defend it and  they tried to blame me and say it is my fault because I did not tell them enough information on how to do it.... really? last I checked I was not the one teaching hair school.  nn So long story short, just wasted my whole day, absolutely ruined my hair and I even paid  to do  it! wahoo. thanks guys real good job.... nn side note  overheard a student talking to the instructor that was doing my hair at the time about his client that was having a problem with her hair. The student said to the instructor, I took care of it though I  told her to just buy a wig .... really that is how they handle there ugly dye jobs? tell their clients to buy wigs...guess that is about the point I am at though. just wish I put my  toward a wig instead. nnI would highly recommend NOT risking your beautiful hair with this place, but then again its your hair to lose.... literallynn"
0,went here late last night.  havent been in a year or so since the last time i came here the service was so poor.  i wasnt any more impressed this time round than i was the last.  the pho is okay and so is the service.  nothing special about this place besides the extensive menu and the fact that its open hours.

0,". VerdictValue Tough to recommend with so many better options on the Strip.  Look at other buffets first.nn. Food Arguably the smallest buffet on the Strip, it not only has a smaller selection, but nothing special.nn. Service Our waitress kept mixing up our drink orders and was difficult to find when we needed the bill.  Im hopeful not all waitresses were like her especially when there isnt much to deliver and sort out in a buffet however, she successfully put a further damper on the experience.nn. Atmosphere Think early s decor with a view.  Restaurants across the nation and buffets in Vegas continued to revitalize themselves in the last  years it may be time for the Paradise Garden to do the same as well."
0,First of all the food was fair to mediocre ! The prime rib was so tough my knife could barely cut through it ! The gelato certainly did not taste like any good quality gelato I have ever tasted! Some of the pastries were Stale! The best thing I had here was the omlett! The Peking duck was so so. The variety of buns  dumplings was amazing but they themselves were ordinary. The short ribs were good! All drinks are not included in this hefty brunch price! So for the price this place is a NO!
0,"Very dissatisfied with our visit here. The wait staff had major attitude and were down right rude. The food was ok, but when we were done I broke out in hives on my face and arms. I dont have food allergies so what the heck!"
0,"While they are renovating the external appearance of the hotel and it is starting to look decent, this place is gross in general.  I cant believe they actually are charging for the rooms given how old and broken they are.  This place needs to be closed down totally, get fixed and then reopened. nnThey also have small valet parking and the y are always full with no exception. Unfriendly staff.  I will never go there even for free."
0,I was in Vegas visiting a friend and needed nails done so we decided to visit this place based on distance. The service was interesting to say the least. I had  people work on  me and not communicate when they had to move to another clients. I got gel nails done on a Thursday and index finger on left hand peeled right off today!!! Would not go back
0,"My wife and I ate here over a year ago, and I was very disappointed in the meal.  I agree that for the price, Id expect a nicer place with better service and not an entrance from the parking lot that is like a service entrance.nnThe food was nothing special.  It is an amalgam, and thats not what we were looking for.  We wanted good Cuban food.  Not here.  This is the one food area where Las Vegas is really lacking."
0,"Why cant you give zero stars??? Worst place ever! They had an all you can drink margharita special, which got us in the door. What we learned is that they made them absurdly salty so that people cant drink more than , maybe , with lots of water. We asked for them to be less salty but thwy said they are premade. nSince im a stubborn guy, I insisted in drinking them. Once id had  they said that was the max! I told them that they advertize all you can drink. Their response was that  is enough and no one drinka that many. Not surprising given the fact that they sabotage them.with ridiculous amounts of salt.nThis place is just a scam. In a city with so many great restaurants and bars, this one should be avoided. Or better yet, closed down for good."
0,Ugh... Rip off. nnCalamari was supposed to be served with  sauces. It wasnt. When I asked about it  min later when I got the servers attention I was informed that what I missed was a generic tartar sauce and did I want it now...nThen I asked for their best favorite most asked for item on the menu. I was steered to the taco salad. nMEH  guacamole was fine and thats saying a lot. nnHad an Amazon Local and they tried to rip me off. Manager was called over and he fixed the bill after another  minutes and blamed the server.  Walked away and left me hanging again. No apologies no ownership. Nothing. nCustomer service  nFood  nRipoff artists
0,"Worst restaurant experience I have ever had. The waitress was absolutely terrible. After not being able to answer any of the questions about her menu, I got tired of waiting for a refill, so I walked to the server station, and asked another server to get more water. Then wanting to pay for my bland shrimp order and leave this dump took absolutely forever. Definitely go somewhere else to waste money on crappy service and food."
0,"First time here and the waitress was rude, plus she came up to our table within  minutes of being seated and wanted us to order, I didnt even get to look at the menu. It wasnt even busy restaurant was basically empty"
0,"I have been here for my Easter Dinner with my hubby drove over   hours but end up very disappointed. We spend person for this buffet, we come here for their seafood station, but we found that the oyster is so skinny  the crab leg is smaller then my pinky finger. Compare with Makino Seafood Buffet in Vegas or Irvine, their oyster  crab leg even better than here!!!  I wont come back again.  Its not worth the price they are charging!!!"
0,"So I went to Los Tacos for the st time yesterday, I was really, really hoping for something better, especially for the price.  I ordered  carne asada tacos with everything and at . a pop I would have rather gone to an acutal sit down restaurant.  Now the tacos are big but the carne asada did not taste well at all! I was so hoping for this to be amazing. But sadly I will have to pass on Los Tacos."
0,"I stopped by American Discount Foods because of unbelievable deals they listed in their weekly ad. I ended up buying absolutely nothing because I couldnt find anything that wasnt past its expiration date. Everything had expired at least  weeks ago, but I found items that had expired as long as  months ago. nnI may consider purchasing expired products if the price was right, but it wasnt. Other than a couple of their weekly deals listed, the rest of their prices werent very good. For example, they had generic boxes of cereal that expired  months ago selling for .. The same thing  except not expired  can be had for . at the  Cent Only store. If youre willing to shop sales, name brand cereal can be had at the grocery store for around .  . a box. Pair a sale with a coupon and you can have brand name cereal for  or less a box. I wont pay a premium for generic expired food."
0,Prosn military discount and relatively affordablen location is pretty good just off strip nnConsn little dirtyn ice machine was broken and they took  minutes to bring icen jets in bath did not work and when I called to ask them to be fixed they said they would send someone but never did n charged Internet fee even if you do not use the InternetnnBasically get the good with the bad.  Long check in line  minutes but gave us free drink tickets when I asked.  Paid extra for view of strip and was cool but windows had water stains.  Can work if you are on a budget.
0,"I really wanted to like this place. Becky had me so ready for a good experience.....Hubs is from Houston, and loves a good casual BBQ joint, and wed been on the road for  hours, so just getting out of the car to stretch our legs was a treat.nnWe arrived at a fun looking place, with cow hides all over, and lone stars everywhere. The smell from the smoker told me it was a solid choice, and I was already patting myself on the back for leading my family here. nnGreeted by a man Bruce whom I assume is a relative of the owners....most likely the dad who was grumpy to have to work that day, and completely unfamiliar with the workings of this delirestaurant.nnHe greeted me brashly and told me that we could sit anywhere we want. We chose a quiet table in a room just off to the side of the main dining room, but in plain sight of the server. This evidently pissed him off to no end, because he said in a gruff voice NO one ever sits HERE and every other glasscupplate he brought out from them on was slammed on the table. He would then tend to another table, and he was as pleasant as pie, so I assume he just had it in for us because we didnt sit in the main dining room.nnThere were only a few tables when we got there just before pm, and they were already out of the cowboy caviar....it was a busy Friday afternoon, and I could hear from the servers other conversations that they were gearing up for a big medieval festival, so I didnt understand how they could be out of their specialty side so quickly.....but, no matter.nnI really thought Bruce was going to have an aneurysm  when he took our order... Im thinking Bruce should be out back tending to the smoker.... But,  I really wasnt offended, as much as amused by his soup nazi mentality.nnI ordered beer. Took  minutes to get it, but it WAS good....served in a tall jelly jar, and only   Made me happy.nnOne ear of corn, which I ordered for my daughter was .... made me sad....especially since it was over cooked and soggy  Corn should never be soggy, unless it comes from the state fair, or from a can....nnIf I had to order from there again, I would get the chopped instead of the sliced brisket....the veins of fat in the brisket were thick and had to be cut off before I could eat it. The chopped brisket, on the other hand, was cheaper in price, and yielded way more edible beef. The smoke flavor was not very strong, and the BBQ sauces seemed to be watered down.nnA family of four ate a lunch there and the meal with tip was over ...that was with NO dessert, and only  worth of beer. It is in a remote area by a destination golf course, so it probably does well with the locals, but I wouldnt go out of my way to go there again."
0,I would not recommend Grandmas Kitchen to people with young children. It is supposed to be a kid friendly restaurant. I guess just not for children  and under. I admit my sons ages  and  were a little noisy. But I did not appreciate being told to keep my children quite. Grandma also telling my children to use there inside voices. I immediately responded by saying  year olds do not understand what an inside voice is and left the restaurant.
0,"overall, this was a pretty unimpressive, and almost downright deeply disappointing experience. went on a recommendation of a friend.  got there, the decor was almost on point, but things not quite right. like, pulled from the pages of trendorama magazine, but literally pulled, nothing there seemed put together organically all these different styles and colors and stuff put together because it should look good together. like, if it were clothes, it would be like buying the designer labels without actually having any style to put it together.nni digress, but walking in honestly put me off a bit and made me feel like it could be a dennys in disguise. however i gave it a shot. menu was interesting, kind of really disjointed, but DID have a lot of veggie options which was good.  nnhad a lot of different worlds going on  thai dishes, crepes french, cous cous, good ol  shepards pie and the like. how can one restaurant excel in all of these things? well, quite frankly it cant. and they proved it.nni ordered the shrimp, scallop and crabmeat crepe with a champagne sauce and it was cold. cold as ice. why would seafood be cold if they just cooked it? where was the champagne sauce? the crepe was tiny, and flavorless, and the seafood was flavorless, and the sauce nonexistent. i couldve been eating my napkin and had the same taste sensation.  other app ordered, goat cheese on crostini a friend got this and crostini wasnt toasted and it had too much goat cheese on it. such a simple offering how can you mess that up?nnsadly, service was amost as bad as food. the fellow who waiting on us was very nice, however, the restaurant was empty, and we never got a drink refill once. never got out plates picked up and generally sat around waiting for him for a total of about hr longer than we shouldve or WANTED to be there.nnsad, disappointing  food, ambiance, service, this place struck out in all three."
0,"This was exactly the reason I havent been to a barber in a couple years. I live nearby so I thought Id give them a try. Angelo was with a customer, so Scott cut my hair. I guess Angelo must be the pro, because Scott cut my hair way too short on top as if he didnt even listen to what I had asked him to do. I didnt realize how short he cut my hair until I got home and found it was all uneven at the front by about . I dont regret giving them a try because theyre so close to home, but I definitely wont be going back."
0,"Saturday, pm. Since this was the first time Id ever been here, my first impression upon walking in was a pretty decent atmosphere. I liked the huge bar, and as soon as I sat down with  friends who were already there, the bartender immediately introduced herself and asked what i wanted. So far, so good.nnWe were waiting for  other people to celebrate a friends birthday and when they showed up, we sat at a table. At this point, it was pretty dead in there. We had our drink a food orders taken fairly quickly by the waitress. By this time, it started to fill up a bit, because they were showing a UFC fight that started at pm.nnThis is where things began to go steadily south. I dont know if their staffing was messed up or what, but our waitress dissappeared for long stretches and getting anyone to take our drink order was impossible. It became so bad that one of my friends actually got up and ordered a drink at the bar because he had an empty beer glass in front of him for over  minutes. He was scolded by the pissed off waitress when she finally reappeared.nnThe straw that broke the camels back, and the main reason why this place gets the big ol One Star, is because of something that I have never experienced in all of my  years. At pm, one hour after the fight started, they started charging a  cover at the door. No big deal. Lots of places do it. The diffrence here is, the manager and one of the waitresses started going around to EVERY table and to the bar and every patron in the place and started charging a RETROACTIVE COVER CHARGE!! Are you friggin kidding me?!?!nnWe had been there for . hours eating and drinking, and they charged us a  cover for the priviledge, which came with a wrist band. Seriously? Five bucks isnt a lot of money, but that seems just stupid. Retroactive cover charges? Wow.nnNeedless to say, I will never go back to this establishment simply on principle. If this is how they treat their customers, they must have a tough time getting repeat business. Management, if you read this, you need to get your shit together and abolish that. Charging a cover at the door at pm for new folks arriving specifiaclly to suck down some water and watch the fight? Understood. Charging a party of  the same after we had been there for over  hours running up over a  bill, as well as all the other folks who were in there too? Thats just bad business practice."
0,"Way overpriced for a below average burger. I had the gold standard burger, just not that good. My friend got the salmon burger cant remember the name for it. The best thing he could say about it was that it was edible. Service was good, and it was a nice place."
0,"They ozed our drinks, rather than filling the cup up all the way, and were  a piece. Our side order of fries was burnt and tasted only of the oil they were fried in. My burger only tasted like grease, instead of the honey mustard sauce, mushroom, and cheese it had on it. The size of the table we sat at was maybe a foot and a half wide. The food never left the premises because we all had to empty our bowels immediately after finishing the meal."
0,I wish we could have met under better circumstances but the moment I walked into your establishment I wanted to vomit.  It reeked of sweaty gym socks and vinegar and there was no room at the bar.nnMaybe I will come back with What Odor? in hand and we can have a fresh beginning.
0,Had the Lentil Soup and a Turkey Special without mayo they dont have low or no fat mayo or cheese. Soup was okay but not terrific. Sandwich was on mushy wheat bread. When they say heated it means your sandwich is zapped in the microwave. The deli meat leaves a lot to be desired. I get much better turkey from my grocery store. All in all a pretty ordinary experience.
0,"This is one of the worst hotel experiences Ive had. Our room smelled of drugs, the hallways smelled of drugs, there were other patrons screaming and yelling in their rooms that the hotel did nothing about and you could hear it from the lobby. The only slightly redeeming factor of this hotel is that a few select staff did seem to actually care about your stay. If you just need a place to sleep for the night, at least you have a clean bed. If youre planning on a longer stay, find a different hotel."
0,My cousins were on vacation and so I believed that goldfield would be a good day. The shops are great for children there are no touch me NOT shops and they are kid friendly. The mines are fun for children as is train.nnThe food is terrible and there is a  gratuity tacked on even if the food is bad and the service is terrible. The chicken wings were cold and took  mins to come out and people next to us were serviced dinner and we came in  mins before them. When I asked why everything took so long she looked at me and said chicken wings take a long time to cook. I used to work in a bar and they take  mins so that excuse didnt work for me. nnWhen the dinner came out the food was cold all around and when I asked if we could get warmer food she just walked away. nnFor  kids meals with drinks and two adults came to ..nnMy advice is to eat before you get there there and dont be slighted this abuse of food and service. nn Stars is what I give.
0,"We have been to the Tatum and Shea location many times and had high expectations. This place did not impress us. We had been on Mothers Day and the place was packed. The staff was friendly but the kitchen didnt seem to be able to cope with the crowd. It was an hour till we got our food and then it wasnt hot.nWe thought we would give it another try so made a reservation for  pm. on Friday night. At  , after not a word from the hostess, we gave up and walked over to PCG and had a great evening. nI dont think well be going back."
0,Beware is all I can say. The tree house is one of those niche places with witty menu items like sticks instead of sides. The salad and soups are leaves and sap you get the point. Prices are way to high...bone in rib eye for !!!! Its a small interior with  bar stools. This place will be gone by summer
0,This resaurant has consistently gone down hill for the last  years. I have been going here since the granding opening when I was  years old. It was always the best around. Not quite sure what has happened maybe their chef got deported?? Food is not the same!!! Bring your real chef back PLEASE!! Also the menu prices have gone up and up and up. Worse food higher cost Not a recipe for success
0,"Slow, painfully slow service.  Only one register open regardless of the length of line.  They exist only because they have a perfect location.  Unbelievable the stuff that goes on here yet customers still come on in.  Wait times for food are horrendous.  There will be numerous people with food in hand in line, yet they sometimes have the only register person also making espresso drinks slowing down the entire line.  I guess that nd register at the end is just for show."
0,"Awesome waitress, appalling general manager and hostess, sat our party at  different tables, when we called for reservations the manager told us he would accommodate  even though their policy was  in a booth.

0,"I have had dinner here a handful of times and the food is been very good. Service from the same waitresshostess She does both has been good, but not today. As my brother was ordering food, I could see that the waitress was getting agitated by my brothers questions. nOnce he was done ordering, my wife and I ordered a Greek salad and a Gyro.nWhen the order came out, the Greek salad came out as the fat Greek salad, not the village Greek salad.nWhen I waived the waitress over, she Was agitated that a mistake it been made. She said I ordered a Greek salad, but there are two Greek salads, a fat Greek salad and a village Greek salad. nWhile shed knowledged that was true, she nastily said I should have specified. Thats true, I guess I shouldve specified, but shouldnt she have also clarified, she is the waitress with more knowledge about the menu than I.nI guess she was just having a bad day.nThis place usually deserves four stars, but not today.nIll check it out again in a month and see how it goes."
0,"Stick to the desserts and drinks.... Food was appalling. Ive had better at applebees. Ordered appetizers which came out with our entrees....really didnt give us much time for table convo or elbow room. Mussels were a total disappointment.

Ordered a coke since the only thing edible were the fries, never got that. Total let down. stick to the sweets on the other side of the room."
0,"Do. Not. Use. This. Company.nnPlease avoid at any cost, and save yourself a huge headache. If your home warranty company sends you their way, like ours did, tell them you DO NOT want their service, and would greatly appreciate going through someone else. nnThere is a big language barrier, we waited over a month for parts, and they werent even the right ones, and after headache, after headache, half the problem we had with our oven was STILL not fixed. We didnt even care at that point. I even spoke to the boss, and our issue was never quite resolved.

The only people in the place were two employees who looked real bored. nnSo I ordered the Boba green tea which was OK how can you mess that up To be safe I ordered their Tempura Ca Roll ummm was pretty disappointed it was lacking on avocado and it was kinda flavorless thank god it had eel sauce thats the only reason I could finish this flavorless yuckalicious roll! My sister ordered the Shrimp Tempura Roll and was also disappointed. nnNot only was the food bad but so was the service! nnI was being stared at the entire time by the two lady employees which was very uncomfortable! They were looking at me as if I was gonna dine and dash!!! My server was more like security than a server the only thing missing was her security badge and baton!! nnI will NOT be returning I want my money back! nnYucko"
0,"Quite pricey for the food that they serve there.nnWe ordered the fries since they got some raves fro Anthony bourdane.  They are just normal fries you can get anywhere for  times as much.  The steak was slightly chewy, not much flavor.  I also had the bouillabaisse soup.  Pretty bland.  The steam mussels left something to be desired.  My  yr old son fished the melon procsuto and said he liked it.nnI would not come back."
0,"Love the idea!  The pizza is good!  But, the place is so dirty.  Employees dont always wear gloves.  They use their hands to do other things than make your pizza.  Saw an employee grab a greasy handle and then he used the same hand to put toppings on my pizza.  Not a one time occurrence it happens every time I go.  Keep thinking it will get better."
0,My boyfriend and I came here for a Rodeo they where having in their Equestrian Center...which is really the highlight of the whole place.  South Point is MUCH nicer on the outside than on the inside.  The decor of this place is so blah and so boring...my grandmas house has more personality.  nnThe gaming is O.K.  I personally lost . in less than  minutes so I cant give an unbiased review.  We ate at the Coronado Cafe after the Rodeo and the service was terrible and the food was lukewarm.  nnOther than the Equestrian Center I see no reason to ever come here again.  Its really far off the strip...crowded...boring...bad cafe...Ill pass!
0,"As previous reviewers have stated, the course is an expensive but beautiful place to play. Those who greeted us when we arrived and left displayed impeccable service.nn..so, why the two stars? I suppose its unfair, but a fact of life, that an experience is remembered not by how much went right, but how much went wrong. Our foursome came to the golf course after a long conference, expecting an opporunity to unwind, talk business, and enjoy some fun after a few days of work. It appears we were scheduled to play ahead of two scratch threesomes. We fell about a hole behind those in front of us, and had planned to start letting those behind us play through at the st par  opportunity on the Raptor course.nnRight before we got to the first par , we were accosted by the rangers. No polite request to speed up play, or to let those behind us play through. Instead, we were critiqued for our slowness of play, and the trouble we were causing those behind, and if we planned to speed up, as if we were playing slow purposefully. nnSo, we allowed the st some behind us pass through.. and immediately on the next hole, were accosted by the very same rangers! Now, we could still see the some we just let pass through teeing off on the hole ahead of us, and yet we were accosted for our slow play.nnSo, regardless of the service we received coming and leaving, regardless of the beautiful vistas, all I remember when I think of this golf course is our discourse with the ranger, which is a shame."
0,"ok. so they are doing somethings right i guess. they are friendly, the place is clean. they have a pretty creative, extensive menu. that said i wasnt impressed enough to ever go back. i went there because i was walking my dog and wanted to stop for lunch they had outdoor seating so i thought id give it a shot. they are very chintsy if thats even a word lol with their dressings. my sandwich was mostly bread. i had the Count of Monte ChaseO sandwich which features ham, turkey, swiss cheese and strawberry preserves. unique huh? you couldnt tell, like i said, i tasted only the bread. if they would be even a little more generous with the lettuce, onions, meats and condiments. i like a sandwich that is as much on my face as it is in my mouth. this wasnt it. nothing fell out of this sandwich!"
0,"This place had a lot of hype...one of the best rated restaurants in town. We were extremely disappointed. The service was terrible, we sat for about  minutes before we even had a menu and were asked if we wanted a drink. When we did finally get the menus we were extremely disappointed with what was supposed to be an extensive wine list. The wine list turned out to be rather weak with a small selection from each region  even France wasnt well represented. nnAfter another  minutes of waiting without any contact from the non existent server we walked out...and walked down the road to Chelseas...which was solid."
0,"The review is mainly for the bar service at the pool.  Absolutely terrible.  Every time I ordered a drink, it took nearly  minutes to receive I timed it.  The servers were friendly but they really need another bar maybe closer and more bar tenders on duty.  When its hot outside, we get thirsty.  The more time it takes you to bring me my drink, the less I will spend and the more unhappy I will become without a drink in hand.  Just saying.nnWe also had a bad experience with one of the socalled security who was supposed to come pick us up by a golf cart,.  He was EXTREMELY rude.  You should really work on serving your hotel guests and that the customer is ALWAYS RIGHT.  Dont be a Dbag, Im paying for YOUR paycheck.nnNice rooms, but they could improve on the pillows.  No patio furniture on the patio, a little strange.nnAlso,  to get from your room to the main lobby  pool may take  minutes of walking. They really need to work on convenience here."
0,"I love burgers, so I really wanted to love I Love Burgers.  I loved the friendly hostesses.  I loved the friendly woman working at the counter.  I didnt love the over cooked, dry burger.  I didnt love the under cooked fatty bacon they slapped on my over cooked dry burger.  So five stars for the employees, but only  stars for the food."
0,"Sneaky and deceitful sales tactics on Low Quality, Cheap jewelry.nnWe purchased a pair of certified diamond earrings from this Jareds back in January and were told that the diamonds were guaranteed from scratches and falling out FOR LIFE as long as we brought them in every  months for inspection. I bring them in for their first  month inspection and sure enough, I am told one of the diamonds are loose and since I didnt buy the mounting warranty then I would have to pay to have the setting tightened or buy the  mounting warranty in order for the diamond warranty to be valid?  Um, what??? nnIf the diamonds are guaranteed for life then that is what it means. Not that I have to pay extra if they become loose BECAUSE THEY ARENT SUPPOSED TO COME LOOSE and thats what your DIAMOND WARRANTY states that it covers diamonds that fall out because of POOR CRAFTSMANSHIP. nnIm not going to pay extra to cover your SHITTY ASS jewelry that doesnt even hold up for  months. My friend got her engagement ring from Jareds and her diamonds fell out  times!! I should have known better than to trust a company with a bad reputation. Just search for reviews online and you will see HUNDREDS of complaints about Jareds and their parent company Sterling Jewelers Inc about the same fraudulent sales practice and cheap jewelery that doesnt hold up.nnMy husband spoke with the GM Tim Miller today who was just as sleazy and slimy as his scumbag sales people. He offered no remedy for his sales people outright lying to us about the fake warranty on their jewelry and claimed that his hands were tied. nnWorthless company and WORTHLESS jewelry!!!"
0,"What happened here????nI go away for a bit and come back and the place turns to Clownville?nTangible,Ive got to say Im disappointed.nThe prices have gone up and the customer service has gone to shit.nIts gotten overrun with gymbunniesrats who meander near the equipment doing not much more than staring at themselves flex.nThen theres the proliferation of independant personal trainers.nTheres no one on staff that can tell you how to use the machines if youre new,and if you cant afford or want to use an independant trainer,youre left to flounder and feel foolish.nTo the faux Jillian trainer,could you stop yelling at your clients from across the damn gym?This is not your reality show,you sound like an ass.I dont go to the gym to be subjected to your showboating and frankly,youre obnoxious.nUnfortunatley,this is the only game in town for me at the moment.nI only hope as the holidays near,the place will empty out somewhat.nI used to love this gym,now I simply tolerate it."
0,"We had a mixed experience here today.  Ill start with the positive  The appetizer platter we got was very good and the kids LOVED the mozzarella sticks.  The adults enjoyed the avocado spring rolls, the other kind of spring rolls not sure what they were called, and the artichoke dip with chips. The beers we selected were also good.  I loved mine, but once again I cant remember the name it was the one our waitress said was the closest to a blue moon beer.  Lastly their thin and crispy fries were wonderful!  nOk, so now for the bad  The men in our group ordered some kind of chicken tacos and the other ordered a personal size pizza...both were TINY portions.  I was not thrilled with the so called sourdough bread that my California chicken sandwich was on...the bread tasted a little burnt.  The worst thing about this meal was that the waitress announced that they were out of the chocolate chip pazookie dessert for the rest of the evening....WHAT?!  When you have little kids that look forward to this dessert, it is not a good thing when you are told that!  This was a late Saturday afternoon...how do you not have plenty of those desserts on hand for a SATURDAY NIGHT????  I still enjoyed the white chocolate and macadamian nut mini pazooki that I got and the kids liked the cookies and cream one they tried.  The pazookies at Oreganos are still better in my opinion....nAnyway, not sure if we will be going here again, but maybe well try the deep dish pizza next time."
0,"Came here for a morninglunch buffet and it sucked bad! My friends and I were hungover, not to mention starving, and were too lazy to walk over to Paris for their buffet so we decided to just try it here since we stayed in Ballys anyways.nnI didnt enjoy the food one bit. The good thing about this place is that it has quite a lot of seating so there wasnt any waiting when we arrived, but I dont think ill ever be back."
0,"We have liked Coatco for many years. However, we are disappointed that the food quality at this location Chandler has gone down hill in recent years. We have bought frozen lobster tails and jumbo shrimp that turned out to stink after they were thawed. We had to through them away. Some meats and vegetables have expired dates on them and are still being sold.  After this past New Years, we bought six prepacked refrigerated roasted duck legs which we had before and they were good. But, this time not realizing that they had expired date when purchased, when I opened them to cook for a dinner party, they stunk so badly when I opened the packets, that I had to move our guests outside! We ended up going out for dinner! Just last weekend, I bought a bag of fresh asparagus. They looked firm and green, but not realize that they were nearly frozen from the box. Next day when I try to use them, they were all rotted.  From now on, we will try to go to different Costcos and see if other branches also have this major problem."
0,"The employes were awful. None of them could smile nor would communicate well with me and they spoke like depressed robots. The burrito was good but, the nachos sucked. If youre alone with luggage and need to wash your hands your out of luck because there are no hand sanitizer wipes."
0,"The only reason Im giving Vida Vida  stars is because the food if you ever manage to get it is rather delicious and well priced.  The Fried Chicken Taco is one of the best tacos Ive ever had, and better than any of the tacos on Vidas menu IMO.  nnThe service however, is atrocious.  The concept here is that you sit down, fill out a slip of paper with your order selections, the waitress takes your slip of paper, and then brings you what you ordered.  Seems pretty simple huh? Well apparently it is much harder to keep track of pieces of paper and enter orders correctly than one could ever imagine.  Ive been here  times and during  of our visits, someone in our party either had their entire order lost, or the wrong items entered.  The waitress have never been apologetic or attentive and all seem like they stepped out of la la land. As a former waitress for  years I know we all have our bad days, but these ladies have all had bad months, and their aloofness doesnt help.  nnI want to be hopeful about the future of Vida Vida and attribute the terrible service to the fact that the restaurant is new, but there are only so many times you can go to a place and continue to be disappointed before you dont go back anymore."
0,"We gave this place several chances. The first bad experience was when they claimed it would be  minutes to an hour for our delivery. An hour and a half later, our freezing food arrived. We thought next time to just not order on a Friday. So we ordered again, and had to call and check up on the delivery after an hour. Food finally arrived, and one of the drinks was missing. We finally gave it one last shot today, and after an hour and a half, we called, and were promised it would be any minute. Twenty minutes later, still nothing. I finally called after almost two hours to cancel the order. The driver arrived in the parking lot shortly after, but who would want to eat the freezing food he had with him. Never, ever again. We will be finding somewhere else to order for our office. I put the menu back up in the break room with a note to warn anyone else off."
0,"So the OWNER of West Liberty Beer and Tobacco threatened to kick my ass today at his store... Long store short I was returning a keg a friend of mine got from for his wedding and the store did not offer him the proper tap. I tried to return the untapped keg and the Owner knew of the situation and told me he would only give me  deposit. He said the beer is probably spoiled and he cant take it. I called him out on his bullshit that storing the keg at  degrees would not spoil it but he wouldnt even let me speak and kept interrupting and answering calls. So of course after being so rude certain choice words were exchanged. I asked to speak with a manager and he said  I am the motherfucking owner! So I gave up, realizing this guy was the biggest jackass I ever met so I started wheeling the keg back out to my car on the dolly and i finally told him to fuck off and he ran over and tried grabbing the dolly off me and said  You cant use my dolly now! After getting the keg in my car as we are still arguing I said I never met a motherfucking owner like you in my entire life! He put his chest to mine and put his finger in my face and said call me that one more time and Ill beat ur ass right here Of course i did call him it several more times and he stormed off. Really thought he was gonna hit me though. Unbelievable that people like this own businesses and conduct them self in such a poor manner! BOYCOTT WEST LIBERTY BEER AND TOBACCO!!"
0,"Lobby bar bartenders are rude. Two bartenders ignored us for  minutes. We tried to get theyre attention and when they made eye contact with us, they made no sign that they had seen us. We finally just decided to leave. There is no excuse for rude service."
0,"This is by far the worst Chinese buffetplace that sells food that I have ever eaten in my whole life.  It does not even deserve the one star. nnI went there one day hungry with a friend and wanted to try this place out. I dont know why they are still open there was like a few other people. The food was VERY greasy, they didnt regularily change the food on the buffet and some of the food had turned cold. The place was mess. I literally took  bites and paid and left. nnIll never go there again even if you paid me. Save yourself the money and go somewhere else."
0,"I am a business owner who has been subject to clients whom feel the need to make up stories or trash me on yelp.  nnSo when I write this I am writing to tell you about my time at Absolutely Chic Day Spa.  Although I was impressed by the size of the place I felt is was a bit of a strange set up.  I have to say first impression was I was scared to use the stairs to get to this place.  I am sure this owner is getting a great deal on their rent.  Or they should be.  The sign upon leaving I noticed that it said to use the elevator?  HU?  The stairs as you get to the top look like they might fall apart.nnThe people I felt were VERY friendly.  However, I did not get the service that is listed on their website.  I think according to the outline for the service I bought with my groupon a few steps were missing.  Now being a business owner I can understand that it might be a little confusing.  But they have the steps on the website?nnThe over all massage if you will, was nothing to write home about however, she did give me a nice neck and head massage. while I was wrapped up...nnI feel like she tried. But it really was not worth the money I paid on my groupon  let alone  if I would have paid full price.  Over all it was just kinda a weird set up and I doubt I will go back.nnI think they have spent  a lot of money on some really nice equipment and furniture but really should think about moving locations and getting some workers who are educated a bit more, and who take pride in the way they look. I understand they are there to work so scrub are more than fine, but she really looked unprofessional with no makeup your a skin business and hair just pulled back in a messy pony.  nnAs far as the treatment I got. I dont see anything different and I asked if it would take more than just one session I was told no...  I see NOTHING.  I guess it was worth the short cat nap I took..."
0,This is an updated review. I remember this place to be so good. So my family was in town and we decided to go there. What a mistake. First of all the place was dead and now I know why the quality of fish is not what it used to be. The rolls werent as good as I remember it. The service was horrible and the waitress had an attitude so did the waiter. With so many other sushi places to choose from sorry to say I wont be back!
0,"This was my first and probably LAST time here.  First off the food is kind of high for being a upper Dennys.  Well we went in about pm, there was only one other table with people, otherwise as I said the place was empty That should have been a sign there.  We were seated fast, and the drinks came fast, we took out time looking at the menu which is on the high side if you ask me hamburger meat, vegetables and potato for  but we saw a small menu that said  dinners for . before pm.  I asked the waitress if the meals were bigger in the main menu since the same items were on that one also at a higher price, she said No, the portions on the  for menu are smaller  I thought that is what I said.  Anyway we ordered the ground beef steak I had baked potato and Vegetables, my wife had mashed and vegetables.  Well our waitress went on a break and came back still before we had any food, about  minutes later our meal came.  While we waited a few more people came in  As we were getting our meal I could hear the waitress telling the people around us they have run out of vegetables and what else would they like.  So I guess we had the privilege of getting the last of the vegetables.  Now you may think I am kidding but the vegetables we got were about  tablespoons worth.  EACH.  I had  small carrots,  small cauliflower pieces and  HALVED prices of zucchini.  My baked potato was not cooked all the way as it was crunchy, my wifes mashed had big pieces of potato skins in it, also our vegetables smelled old, like they had been sitting around for hours if not days.  My meat was fine, my wifes was burnt and had gravy on it so you would not see it.  So needless to say at  for . . with tax was about  to much.  Better go next door to Ruby Tuesday or maybe a Dennys."

0,"This place is pretentious and snobby, but thats exactly its appeal. Its just doesnt appeal to me. If you like laid back beerbars like Esquire or Mike and Mollys, youll be confronted with something entirely different at Boltini. If youre interested in paying a bit more for girly, froofroo cocktails, food that looks like food only smaller, or an entirely different experience this is the place for you. nnMy most memorable moment at Boltini asking for a Blue Moon and being handed a bottle its on draft everywhere else, and nearly spitting it out when I was told it would cost .! UPDATE Blue Moons are ., not .. They also assigned a single waitress to a group of over . When the clearly overworked waitress couldnt keep up with the groups demands for drinks, I went to bar, and was rudely told by the snobby bartender woman that she couldnt add my beer to my tab because I had started the tab with the waitress. Again, I feel this would be an easy request for any other downtown pub to fill but Boltini staff are too good to add one number to another number. nnThat being said, if youre interested in fancy cocktails and fancy foodand are willing to pay extra for ityoull probably like this place. If youre not a cocktail drinker, then skip this place.nnUPDATE Thanks to Robb for responding to my concerns. Like I said, its not my taste, but many people seem to like it. Id rather have a diverse downtown than have everything the same."
0,"Hertz has bombed twice now. First no cars for hundreds of people in Denver. Now we paid for an intermediate, took  minutes to get a car and when I checked Nissan Versa is a compact. Contract clearly states intermediate and Versa is a compact. Would not answer phone. Do not want to waste vacation with this kind of company. What happened to Hertz?!?! No stars."
0,"It was overcrowded and it was hard to find the parking garage. I wasnt that impressed with the sales. We went to Sketchers shoes outlet and it was overcrowded and small. People were throwing boxes everywhere and it was felt like I was in a can of tuna, just awful. The employees were rude and had no clue how to assist customers."
0,"Where do I start?nnI like the bread and how it taste, it also has a good shelf life. After it goes stale I use it to make homemade croutons... very flavorful with my recipe.nnOver the years the quality has gone downhill. The loaves have gotten smaller, the price has gone up. They say they have discontinued some styles, but I find them elsewhere CostCo and they still sell the  loaf.nnRecently the owner past away, just about the time they moved locations and were bought out by Swiss Oven Bakery, their  person workforce was raided just last week and Mesa Sheriffs Dept arrested  illegals working for them. Booo... two thumbs down on that move guys, you should know better. Whos running your HR department?nnThe newer facility is nicer, cleaner, bigger and has room to move around in their factory store where you can get ua and  markdown product. Its worth the trip, but you have to go early as soon as they open to get the better selections. Youll see many local labels that they make too, like Sprouts grocery label etc. always a deal when I stop by."
0,"The course itself is fine. The customer service from the golf shop to cart attendants is ALWAYS terrible.

0,"Not great.  No, maybe moderately bad.  I just moved my office to the th Street Corridor or Squaw Peak Corridor or Piestawa Peak Corridor, if you are new to PHX, and for the most part the food in the area is great.  Bluewater is not worth a second chance with so many good options.nnI went for lunch, perhaps not Bluewaters strong suit.  I was alone and sat up at the bar immediately in the front door.  Realizing that I had sat at the Oyster Bar, I wanted to ask the ChefDressed gentleman behind the counter if I could order regular nonoyster lunch.  I waited patiently until the ChefGuy and a customer finished their conversation about s Japanese sports cars a minute or more to be acknowledged which I did not mind because, heck, I like cars, so I could ask my question.  I was told I could get anything I want.  I love that statement.  Maybe I want a vineyard, but its probably not on the list of specials.  I was handed a paper menu that already had a half a dozen mayo stains on it.  I hope it was mayo.  To my surprise, the lunch fare included  or so dishes ranging from  to .  I was surprised because I thought it would be cheaper judging from how Bluewater did no remodeling save the signs and flags from when The Fish Company served mediocre fare here.  I blew the bank on the  Crab Club.  I asked ChefGuy what was on it, and he not so appetizingly said bacon, avocado, mayo the last guy must have got it too tomatoes and yes, crab.  Simple, right?  I went for it and got a Manhattan red clam chowder and coleslaw.  I received a large amount of free bread for one person without asking.  I didnt want it.  I got a sandwich after all, and Im not carbloading for todays workout.nnAround this time, a nice older woman from Hawaii, she told me, sat next to me and she ordered ice tea.  She didnt get it.  She told ChefGuy that she did not want bread.  She got it anyways.  She ordered a glass of wine.  She did not get that.  Another chap at the bar proclaimed , He always does that.  He gets so distracted.  Seven people are at the bar...nnChowder arrives.  Its ok.  Its my fault.  I dont think I have ever had memorable Manhattan Chowder.  If you are from New England and want to tell me how Phoenix food is horrible and how the only good chowder is back east, i.e bagels, pizza, deli, etc., save your fingers.  I just dont care.  Go back east and take your pushy Trader Joes Behavior with you.nnSandwich arrives much later.  I didnt mind. The British Open was on the TV.  The poor crab was getting a second chance at swimming.  The mayo sauce was running out on to the plate.  The chef should be fined for making a  calorie meal into a  calorie meal.  I could not for the life of me taste crab.  I could have ordered Styrofoam Club, I would not have known the difference.  Coleslaw sucked.   nnI paid my  lunch with water tab and bounced.nnOn the good side, it was relatively clean, there was no real fish smell and I didnt get in an accident in the parking lot.nnBack in the office now, the displeasure continues in my abdomen.nnn          UPDATE        Jeff, the GM, contacted me via email and said that he discussed the review with staff.  He invited me back for another try.  Thats pretty solid.  Well see."
0,"I disagree, this Taco Bell is NOT the best. They FOOL you into THINKING its the best because they repeat your order back to you in the drivethru, in the order that  you ordered the items, and then you feel confident that they got it right, then you pull up to the window and they repeat it to you AGAIN, giving you MORE false confidence, and then you check the bag and everything LOOKS right, then you drive all the way home and discover youve got the wrong items, things you didnt order, wrapped to label what you asked for. nGranted, at the end of the day, its all the Bell and pretty much the same. So you eat it anyway. But you still harbor resentment for the trickery."
0,"When we walked inside and saw the menu we had high expectations for this place. nnThere are some very exotic sounding burger options, but I just went with a basic burger and fries. nnThe burger was pretty good, but a little dry. I get the feeling the people at Burger Studio paid more attention to unsuccessfully making the inside look sleek and modern than they did making sure they use high quality ingredients in their food. nnBurger Studio is ok, but nothing special. They tried to make it a hipmodern burger place, but they failed."

He was pretty friendly as well.nnOverall it was decent. I wont be back however. Ill stick to Pho Saigon  and Pho Kim Long if i absolutely need pho past pm."
0,"I have a huge bone to pick with Ede  Ravenscroft. My graduation gown, according to the website, was supposed to be black, with a black silk hood lined with white silk. Now, hats off to them, they got the colours spot on. And they were very efficient from start to finish. However, it was definitely not silk. Every other graduate with a different coloured hood had a silk lining, and it looked nice. Us MA lot had to make do with a cheap looking polyester.nnNow I wouldnt mind this at all if it had been advertised as black cheap polyester hood with cheap polyester white lining. But it wasnt. And it cost the same amount as the silk hoods. That just seemed a bit unfair. Also, it was ua to wear something for about  hours, and it wasnt even ironed properly. Having a complete monopoly on graduation gown hire, they seem to just take you for a bit of a ride. Only problem is, theres no one else to get your gowns from."
0,"Service was excellent but food is too salty and not good.  Asian Cafe Express in Mesa is still the best Chinese food in Phoenix Metro. This place is so expensive and not worth it. We had the the spicy tofu, Hunan beef, orange chicken, lamb sizzling plate, Steam bun, pot sticker in chili sauce. Nothing tasted good.  I think  of  of us had an upset stomach after having the spicy tofu. Definitely not going back."
0,"Given the ratings and location of the restaurant, Charlie Palmer Steak is way overrated. The price of the steaks were fair. Wine prices were also fair. Service was so so. nnThe bad part is one of our group of  had a steak for   porterhouse side was very bad. The manager took action immediately and gave them another piece. Furthermore, he proactively sent out  more sides. Despite the fact that he tried, steak at  a pop should not be bad. If youre heading down this way of the Strip, youre better off at Tenders over at Luxor."
0,"I have had my belt replaced after coming in originally for an oil change not once, but twice. My G Infiniti Coupe which has never had any issues started screeching.

Fast forward  months and my car ends up through AAA at a different auto body shop, Vegas Auto Body for a new thermostat. I ask John, to take a look at the belt because ever since it was changed the noises occurred. He didnt even hesitate in saying after looking at my car that the belt that was put on from before was too big! That I should take it back and get the right one put on. I take it back, the same waste lf time again....nothing wrong with the belt,  but now a pulley.

0,"THIS IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE WORST BUFFETS I HAVE EVER BEEN TO IN LAS VEGAS! I HAVE NEVER LEFT A BUFFET UPSET  HUNGRY!nnI came here for breakfast MONDAY MORNING right after the whole EDC WEEKEND. I thought to myself...HOW CAN YOU REALL FCK UP BREAKFAST?? ITS LIKE IMPOSSIBLE! nnAnywho...this place happened to do so. The eggs are tasteless...LITERALLY TASTELESS! The sausage was OK...the bacon was decent...the biscuits were whatever, etc... EVEN THE OMELET TASTED WEIRD...and THE APPEARANCE OF THE OMELET WAS DISGUSTING. Out of my whole breakfast meal...the best thing was the unlimited servings of ORANGE JUICE...and the GRAVY.nnI have never left a buffet so upset and so hungry in my life. nnOn the other hand...the restaurant looked very clean and very beautiful, but the food does not speak for itself. Another thing about this place is that they have cheap food...the price for breakfast was about ?? nnYES I WAS HUNGRY...I did not lose my appetite from you know what.nnFINAL words? DO NOT COME HERE! if I were to come here...it would be for Champagne BrunchnnUNTIL THEN!!"
0,"Ordered the trenta iced coffee, paid over  compared to a .! The worst part about it is that it is really, really watered down. It does not taste like the other Starbucks iced coffee which has that nice strong flavor without the burnt taste. If you are a fan of nice and strong Starbucks iced coffee, dont bother ordering it here."
0,"My experience at Sushi Muramoto in Hilldale was fairly disappointing.nnMy friend and I went on a weeknight and shared a plate of nigiri and a couple of rolls for filler. Our edamame appetizer was nice. She had a lemon drop cocktail that was proclaimed good, and my Sapporo was just fine.nnSushi is all about the fish and the quality here did not live up to the prices. I was served a piece of salmon that I knew was not good enough to be sushi grade by looks alone. The Spanish Mackerel lacked sharpness and dimension. Freshwater eel was room temperature and overly sweet. Other nigiri were fine, but forgettable. nnThe two rolls my friend and I shared were good  the Yellowtail and scallion roll and pickled radish roll were great.nnService was O.K. however, for the price, I expect better fish. I dont know how much of this I can put down to sushi in Wisconsin but hey, planes fly everywhere so theres not much of an excuse. I dont recommend Sushi Muramoto."
0,"This vet went downhill when all of the vets left a couple of years ago.  We really liked the vets they had, but had not so great experiences with the new vets.  The staff is really great, but a lot of them left as well.  When more than half the staff leave makes me wonder if there are some issues at the higher levels."
0,"Beware!   tax additional Amenity Charge. nnIm sure they add this so that it looks like the Westin is a cheaper place to stay, so make sure you add this into consideration of the listed daily rate when you check  Priceline, or other online search engines. I picked it because it appeared to be more reasonably priced for its location. After the add on service fee, the price was pretty much the same as hotels closer to the strip.nnThe price for this extra fee isnt anywhere until you checkout. It was mentioned on my booking info, but no actual price or mention of it at check in. It should have been explained then, as apparently there is also a free happy hour, but no one at check in bothered to mention that either, nor did I find that info anywhere in the room. nnThis is pretty funny, the first night we stayed the hot water wasnt working in our room, neither the shower or the faucet. When I called down to ask about it, I kid you not the person who answered literally said it was the first time he had ever heard someone complain about the lack of hot water. I can only assume it was his first day on the job, as he then suggested having an engineer come to the room to see what was the issue maybe he thought we didnt know which way to turn the faucet??. nnOther than that, the room was ok, nothing special, no view except for the parking lot across the road. nnIts off the strip, so you should also know there may be a wait to get a taxi anywhere.nnOverall, it would be difficult for me to recommend this hotel again."

0,I didnt love it the burger was so so the bread tasted stale. The service was bad real bad she seemed annoyed when I asked a question about  of the beers.  I think maybe she didnt want to work or was having a shitty day.  Go to rehab burger down the street wayyyyyy better.  Gave it two starsgenerously because good atmosphere game volume was on. The hostess didnt even say bye when we left she was just texting not even looking up.  Good luck surviving in Old Town CB  CB. Teach your staff MANAGER!!
0,Food was not bad but they need to improve the service which was extremely slow and  forgetful because only three waiters were running around managing a full restaurant. I doubt we will ever go there for dinner but I heard the lunch buffet is supposed to be good and we will give it a try.
0,"I probably wont be ordering from Enzos again. For starters, the lady who took my order was rude...I believe she is the owners wife. She wasnt friendly at all and didnt even give me a time span of when the food would be delivered. Instead she said well see you in a little bit. Really? Because to me, a little bit is  minutes. They showed up  minutes later. nnWe ordered the garlic knots, hot wings and a  topping pizza. The garlic knots were alright, nothing special. I think they should probably be saved for a dinein experience when you receive them piping hot. The wings were good although could have used a bit more sauce. nnOk, so our pizza order was a little complicated. It actually wasnt but apparently nobody understood our request. We ordered a pizza covered entirely with onion and jalapeno, half pepperoni and half olives. There were three of us who all have different likes thus the complicated order. We received the pizza and it was all screwed up. Three slices were covered in olives. Two slices had onions. Four slices had pepperoni and then a few jalapenos thrown on three slices by the crust. I called in to let them know they messed up and I get the wife on the phone. She asks me to explain what I ordered and what I received. Halfway through the conversation without notice, she hands the phone to who I assume is Enzo. He asks me to explain what happened and I tell him and while Im talking he starts yelling at his wife. Um I suggest you wait until the customer is off the phone before your start your domestic dispute. He offered me a free topping for my next order.  I wont order from there again and  JUST ONE TOPPING?!??! Seriously? Ughhhh! nnAnyway, the pizza was alright. A little greasy for my taste but the crust was good. Very light and fluffy.nnI wont be going back to Enzos."
0,When you cant buy milk or white wine at a grocery store without it being spoiled or turned why would I ever buy meat or seafood?nnTwice Ive bought milk that has been spoiled despite the best before date was weeks away and twice I have bought white wine thats completely skunked. nnDoes your stock just sit on palettes behind the store for hours in the Arizona sun before you attend to it?  Cant understand why the same products are always perfect at frys. nnIt shouldnt be this difficult. nExtremely disappointing and kinda gross.
0,"We went at about pm on . I agree with the comments of Gabi A. For me the service was horrible and the food was worse. My wife said disgusting.  I got the risotto which the waiter recommended as their most popular item. The risotto was undercooked and hard. The red sauce kind of tasted like bland ketchup. The seafood in it was over cooked, shrunk up to small pieces and had a strong fishy stinky smell. My wife ordered a stuffed fish, I cant remember what it was called started with a B. It was overcooked and dry. The stuffing tasted like perfurm not sure how else to describe it. We didnt send it back but thinking back we should have. We only ate about half of each dish. At the end of the meal the waiter asked how it was we told him not very good. He just ignored and changed the subject.  I would give zero stars if i could. Go to the buffet instead."

0,"Walked here after having dinner at Liberty Market, since I couldnt have any of the desserts offered there.  After the friendly and very helpful female host helped to phone the pastry chef to address my food allergies, I placed my order of a slice of Dangerous Dilemma and a chocolatecovered walnut strudel and was seated at a twotop next to a window with a view of a parking lot.  I decided to while away the wait on the dessert by looking at the baubles on display by the entrance.  A few moments later, the host notified me that the strudel had cornstarch, so its a nono for me, and that  I would not be able to dine inside since I should not have been seated with an outside drink.  Would this be a problem?, she asked. I said no, paid for my togo dessert, and settled on a bench outside the cafe.  While the two forkfuls that I tried of the multilayered dense cake cookie crumb bottom layer, dark chocolate fudge cake, white chocolate mousse, another layer of dark chocolate fudge cake, and then topped with raspberry coulis were delicious, I inadvertently became the meal of ghost mosquitoes so I had to pack up and leave, yet again.  All because I had a lidded togo cup of Liberty Market drip house coffee with me.nThe . tax included cake slice was tasty although almost a bit too sweet, and I cant fault someone for following house rules, but I wished my drink couldve been overlooked.  There were only two occupied tables out of  to  tables. Heck, I couldve ordered a glass of wine, or another cup of coffee, with my dessert had I not been turned away..."
0,"Weve been ordering from here for at least five years. The most recent deliveries have taken an excessive amount of time. Tonight we placed the order at pm. The driver called us at  saying he was on the nd street bridge and asking where we lived in Shaler. The only problem is we live in Lawrenceville... Off of Stanton. Its now  and still no order. We should have picked it up, Id be in bed by now. The pizza better be hot, but I have a feeling it wont be."
0,"Atrocious service  failure to manage a simple breakfast selection of food.  Biscuits? Sorry, were out for awhile.  Hashbrown potatoes? Sorry, were out right now.  Fries? No were out of those too.

Brilliant folks working here... brilliant!"
0,"We stopped in here with  for lunch during the world cup. The food is not that great. Its OK, but clearly came out of a can or was premade without any preparation for the meal. Appetizers are ALL fried and their dishes come with HUGE portions that arent really appropriate. nnThe bar seemed fun, although we were here during lunch and on a Sunday so it was pretty quiet. However, because the game was going on the service was TERRIBLE. Our waitress barely stopped to check in on us and took over  minutes to return our check after we asked for it. All the waitresses were just hanging around and talking to each other or flirting with a group of guys at the bar and not waiting on the  tables that were seated. nnWill probably not be back any time soon."
0,"I went in for an appointment at the Lake Mead offices in Summerlin so I could get my teeth cleaned. Originally I had scheduled the cleaning and exam for the same day. Unfortunately my COBRA was not in place so I had to wait. I tried to schedule another appointment for a cleaning but was told the hygienist I wanted was not available and I had to see a doctor first. I scheduled an appointment for Dec .  The first glimpse of what was to come came when I went to the front desk. I was offered an oral cancer screening for  which I declined. The receptionist then told me how a friends family member was diagnosed with oral cancer and their life was saved or something to that effect. I again declined. I should have left right then. nI filled out the paperwork for a new patient even though I had been at the office in the past. I went to a different dentist after my initial visit in . I had a full set of xrays and was seated in an exam chair. The dentist came in and introduced himself and made some small talk. He took a moment and looked over my xrays and then started an exam. Within a moment or two he asked the technician to look at the full sets of xrays on the screen and proceeded to tell me that I had significant calcification and I needed a deep cleaning. I declined and he informed me I would need to sign a waiver that I was going against his advice. He then left and I waited for the next person to come in and finish. In around five minutes or so the hygienist I had originally requested because she was recommended by a friend came in to discuss the deep cleaning. I again said no I was not interested and she asked why. I informed her that I had had the service performed in the past and really viewed it as a way to increase charges and revenue. She said that the dentist had measured the depth of my pockets, etc. and had recommended the deep cleaning.  In fact he spent very little time actually examining my teeth and did not seem to check the pockets with any detail She then proceeded to give me her spiel about what the deep cleaning entailed and that even with a signed waiver they could not do a normal cleaning for liability reasons. At this time I left.nIn the past I worked in retail and am familiar with the practice of up selling products and services. I have worked with people who have really want to sell you something and would use whatever persuasion they could come up with. In some cases the persuasion used bordered on lies and half truths. Anything for the sale. I have never experienced this type of pressure sales in a supposedly professional setting. I was offended by the attitude from the beginning at the reception desk through having the hygienist take the condescending attitude of we cant clean your teeth unless you have the deep cleaning  the dentist recommended. I am over  years old and doubt very seriously that any further decay of bone and tissue could be linked to having my teeth cleaned normally at Boston Dental in . In fact I contend that the refusal to clean my teeth is much more actionable.nI am sending this information to my insurance carrier and will spread the word in as many places and using whatever avenues I can that the practice is not customer focused and you are only in it for the money rather than what the customer patient wants."
0,"We came here to eat probably around am on New Years after the fireworks since we were hungry.  But all they had available was their breakfast buffet.  It was mediocre at best.

So I asked girl at front counter if they normally dont wear gloves to protect food aka health code she said it was only her first few days here and she did not know she said I think so ? I said well hes not now and now hes making my good gross. so I just asked for a refund . The staff was nice and the owner came out  was able to issue refund an apologized. The food coming out for others looked really good but I guess I wont be finding out.

0,"I had high hopes after reading plenty of positive reviews on yelp. Not to mention being out of town, I wanted to go to place the locals went to and not just some chain restaurant.nnWe drove an extra  minutes to get to Daily Dose from our hotel. I was actually excited to try the breakfast.  My two breakfast weakness are eggs Benedict and Belgium waffles and it is always a challenge for me to choose one or the other.nn At Daily Dose, I decided to try their  Strawberry Creme Brule Belgium waffle which sounded great from the description. It was going to be topped with fresh strawberries, vanilla bean crueme brule  whipped cream. You also had to option with a choice of fresh fruit, cottage cheese or DD hash. I opted for the DD hash.nnWhen the dish came out it looked quite nice as you can tell from the photo.nnhttpwww.yelp.combizphotosHCCgrVnHQFIlHsLvUQ?selectgkkpOGnTGmRuNBYxzXAnnHowever, eating it was another thing.  The whipped cream was fine, and the creme brule sauce was very sweet which substituted having to use regular maple syrup.  My issue with this Belgium waffle was the texture. As you cut through the waffle, it was like cutting through a very dense cake and it ended like a rock in my stomach for the next few hours. no bueno Most of the Belgium waffles Ive had elsewhere are light and crispy.nnI thought, Oh, maybe it was just my Belgium Waffle that was dense and cake like. However, my friend who ordered the blueberry version of the Belgium Waffle had the same complaint. He too never had such a dense cakey waffle before. nnhttpwww.yelp.combizphotosHCCgrVnHQFIlHsLvUQ?selectXtVobWGTogicsDEiLgnnThe DD hash ended up to be a sauteed squash which which was both sweet and savory, I think it is definitely and acquired taste. nnThe service was decent. Our coffee cups were never half empty. nnThere are both indoor and outdoor seating in the patio.nnPerhaps it was a bad day to order Belgium waffle at DD, but sadly it left me feeling disappointed after being so excited to try this place out."

0,"I had been referred to DR Mendelson from my primary physician. I did not like his beside manner on first impression. he scheduled me for a fine needle aspiration. on the day of the procedure i sat in the room for a half an  hour and when he finally did come in he swabbed my neck and stuck the needle in and was done in less than  seconds. the lymph node swelled up almost immediately. I knew then that I needed a new doctor. he charged thousand of dollars for that  to be exact. I was able to get scheduled at the May clinic. they did an  Aspiration with  the help of a sonogram and the procedure took a half an hour. no pain, and they got good samples.  on follow up Dr. Mendelson wanted to schedule surgery to remove the lymph node. we told him we were going to the May clinic. at the Mayo they scheduled me for a PET scan and found the potential cancer in my throat. they removed the lymph and cancer in one surgery. I would have had to have multiple surgeries with Mendelson. please if you have cancer  run for your life. I was lucky he is not the only game in town."

0,"I know this is not a five star but hey...Housekeeping is rude, the restaurant workers are rude, the bellman and even the old lady who sales hot dogs is rude.

WTF how is the carpet wet. We had some dirty clothes on the floor and they were soaked. We had to leave out and drive  miles to go wash. We can not figure why are carpet is soaked..Housekeeping kept saying that we had a dnd do not disturb sign on the door. We took that off at pm and right when we took it off we called housekeeping and asked for service... So about pm this lady came and made our beds and gave more towels. She was nice but the towels look horrible and dirty...housekeeping  didnt empty the water in the ice bucket this morning, didnt put the iron and the board up. The beds are made horrible. I make my bed better this. I called the front desk on day one and said hi can i have an extra chair please? She said No! That was it vs. I do apologize but unfortunately we will not be able to meet your needs or something like that.. i went downstairs for breakfast it was not bad but not good either. I had steak and eggs and i didnt eat it because it was hella tough..The sausage that my daughter ate was not season. I am sooooo over South Point. We have to come to vegas often but we will NEVER come back here again for ANYTHING! At first i was thinking that its not a bad hotel but never again will i come back.

0,"Lets just say, I was not a fan!  We went here with a group in the middle of the week and we received absolutely terrible service. nnIt took forever for us to even get greeted let alone water. Then our food came out at all different times which is always awkward because your food gets cold while you wait for everyone else to be served. nnNow lets get to the food. I ordered the mac  cheese and a side salad, it was blah! In fact it tasted like processed cheese not even fresh cheese. One of my coworkers ordered the fettuccine Alfredo, and he sent it back because he said it tasted like jarred Alfredo sauce. A few others ordered sandwiches that came with french fries, and they appeared to be happy. So if you stick with the typical diner style food youll probably be somewhat satisfied.

0,"My coworker and I went here last Friday for lunch.  We ordered  minutes ahead of time online. The instructions said when we got there to go straight to the pick up area for our food. When we arrived it was a few minutes after our pick up time, the place was packed and two guys behind the counter wouldnt acknowledge us or meet our eyes. After a few minutes I was finally able to get one of their attention. We informed him we were there to pick up our online order. The guy at the pick up station asked the guy at the register if he had any online orders. The guy at the register gave us a deer in the headlights look, they hadnt even printed them. The guy at the pick up station told us our order came in just before a rush, he offered no apology. They then put our orders on the line, behind everyone in the lunch rushes orders. We asked what was the point of ordering online? They guy just said it depends on the day, some days they get a rush and some they dont, again no apology or offer to expedite our order. Apparently online orders dont matter of a rush comes in. We had to wait quite a while to finally get our food and rush back to work, they still never apologized for the delay. I ordered a BLT bowl with turkey, ham, bacon, pepper jack, lettuce and spicy ranch. I got  shredded iceberg lettuce and  meat and cheese. It was a disappointing visit and meal. An apology or some kind of gesture to show that they cared about fixing their mistakes would have gone a long way to help the situation. This was my first and last visit."
0,"The star is for the wait and the way management dealt with the situation. I waited for basically  hours. Some people behind us in line waited over an hour and were turned away! Then they told us that essentially we would only have  minutes to get food. Um, really? After waiting an hour, we discovered that we could have paid  extra to skip the line. We wished we knew that earlier, but at that point, didnt think itd take another  minutes to get seated. Once inside, the place was half empty and plenty of food. I went in feeling so frantic that it took half an hour just to relax and enjoy my dinner. nnThe manager should have told us when we paid not to worry that the food will stopped being served in  minutes, but that it would plenty of time to enjoy. Because the way told us with fear in her eyes freaked me out. And honestly, there was more than enough time, I didnt have to run around piling plates on the table.

So after waiting about  minutes in the cramped front section that was full of waiting customers I got up and grabbed a menu from a stack so that we could see the menu options and save time when we got to the table as we were starving, the menus were sitting on a front counter unnatended, before I could even turn around one of the employees comes up behind me and in a stern voice exclaimed what are you doing?! I gave the kid a cold look,  obviously I wasnt amused, one of the other waiting customers said wow as this happened.  I put the menu down and we left.  We may try this place in the future, but with the current economy, and businesses closing their doors everyday, you would think businesses and workers would show a little more care and appreciation for the people who choose their establishment over the countless other options out there."
0,"Service was SOOOO slow. The food was overpriced and less than desirable. The decor was straight out of Threes Company at the Regal Beagle. We would have fared better by bringing McDonalds in to eat and enjoy the view. Oh, and the AC was cranking out subzero temps. I wished I had brought my parka with me."
0,"I used to love Paradise Bakery...nn...and then Panera bought them. nnThey have gotten rid of the two things I LOVED there  the Chipotle Turkey Wrap and the BBQ Chopped Chicken Salad. Its probably just my bad luck that those were two of my favorite items, but its still disheartening. nnThe service at this location is not good and the prices have increased. Sadly, I dont think Ill ever be returning to Paradise Bakery."
0,"I dont know why this place has amazing reviews. It has the typical signs of success meager frame, limited customer service, few choices, and relatively inexpensive. The problem is Tacos Atoyac does not deliver in food quality. The hotdog was the best that I tried from the menu mostly due to the interest of avocado. The burrito was boring and really needed the sauces to cover up the dry meat. The sauces did not even come in a significantly spicy variety. Not what I was expecting and I must say I am disappointed."
0,This is the WORST MCDONALDS I HAVE EVER BEEN TOO!!! The staff is rude and the order is never right. How hard is it to make a mcdouble without onions and mustard. Every time I come here my order is never right and I have to go back...
0,"In general, the quality of the work wasnt very good. Aesthetically, it is less than pleasing. One of the screaming problems they had technically was that they used a car jack the upright kind to jack up the air conditioner on my roof rather than professionally removing and replacing it. Then when we had problems with the air conditioner leaking both water and air because it wasnt set right the owner said it wasnt his problem. After he was unconscionably rude to me on the phone, he reluctantly agreed to fix the setting of the air conditioner. His fix was some rubber bits and a nail.nThey also charged me . to comb out the fins on my air conditioner. Even though they never did that. I paid for that myself. nThey also reused my old tiles that they had popped off my roof. The tiles that were broken when removed they replaced with some tiles that were taken from another job. nThey left broken pipes in the roof and we had to tell them to replace them, because they werent planning to. They were just going to leave them in and give us a check back for them when the job was done. nThey backed into all of our awnings on one side of the house. They ruined a privet hedge that has been there since the s. And they left garbage and nails everywhere. nThe saga continues... At the beginning of this year, we found out after paying two plumbing companies, replacing the toilet, cleaning up sewage, digging up the back yard that Aladdin covered up the air flow pipe in our bathroom that caused us almost ,. in repairs, replacements and time. They fixed that and put in the pipe after a letter to the BBB and they said they would deduct all of those expenses from our final bill. They still have not. It has been months.nIf you can believe this, the last invoice I received was an inaccurate and nasty You better take care of this or we will negatively effect your credit invoice and they tacked on a late fee, just for good measure. Then, I get a ridiculous email from the head of accounting the one with  years of experience who cant follow the terms of our contract that says she is done playing games with me. Had I known this was a game, I would have played along sooner. n       The most horrible part of all of this, we went with them because they were local. We are very big on supporting local companies. They are an Arizona company and we really love to support our community. We checked them out on the BBB website and they had an A rating. And we also checked the ROC website and they had had no complaints so we felt confident hiring this business. We liked our sales men, yes, there were more than one. The work itself isnt impressive but I am over that. It is the treatment we have suffered from the owner and the head of the billing office since that is really shameful and I wouldnt wish this nightmare on anyone. Oh and by the way, were still finding nails..."
0,"I walk on a Sat morning at am for a retouch on my ombre hair. I had it blonde already and the lady first told me to wait I did. She then came back got me started put foils on which I think she wasnt going to do bec my hair was already light. I show her a picture and ask her if thats how it was going to look a few times and she keep telling me yes. Long story short afterhrs or so she remove the foils and wash my hair put some treatment on it and left me therefor another mins. I got tired of waiting for her and wash my hair and I also blow dry my own hair bec she was busy with  other ladies. My hair was horrible YELLOW AND FRY so burn, uneven tones of yelloworangeblack and red when all I wanted was a caramel ombre. I was so mad but I still just pay her after hrs all I wanted was to go home so I had no energy for arguing. I did told her I didnt like it and that it was too yellow she just said it looks pretty and continue on checking me out. I do not recomment Rachel or the location on th st at all. I when the next day with the intention of looking for the owner so I when to the other location on th ave and Camelback Lorraine was awesome she immediatley address me and apologize, did a color correction. She fix my hair it look exactly how I wanted. She was really nicecaring and ask what I wanted and not wanted. She was also super fast and did my hair in about hrs or less. I really recomment Lorraine at the Camelback location. She also didnt charge me for the correction she just apologize for the incovenience and gave me a treatment to fix my brittle dry hair."
0,"I finally popped in to Hof Kelsten to try out how they matched up to Guillaume.  I was happy enough to see that the folks at HK arent merely copying what Guillaume is doing en anglais.  Aside from the utilitarian vibe cement floors, unpaintedunfinished wood walls, etc. the two are apples and oranges.nnI ordered a special club sandwich which was an interesting twist on the classic club some sort of herbinfused oil Im guessing tarragon, there was no explanation and whole seeds of coriander which, while giving a nice burst of coriander flavour, werent exactly pleasant to chow into.  There are these rad things called spice mills that could easily remedy that.nnMy wife got a chicken salad sandwich which was nothing necessarily special to write home about.  Hof Kelsten chicken salad  chicken salad.nnLastly, the bread.  Im crazy about bread and that was easily the best part of the meal.  It would make sense that the bread is the specialty here, because it was the most redeeming part of the sandwich, but at  a sandwich, Id rather just grab a loaf and make a sandwich at home.nnWe happened to come in around h on a Saturday, and were the first in line yet from order to reception of food, the whole process took around  minutes.  Ive worked in plenty of delis and restaurants that make sandwiches and unless the kitchen staff happened to be on break as soon as we ordered, this is a long time to wait for a couple of sandwiches.  For a deli, this is pretty sad.nnAll in all, unfriendly service, long wait, and overpriced fare.  No thanks, Ill go to Guillaume or make sandwiches at home.  If anything was organic or warranted the costs, itd be a deal.  Knowing how cheap the ingredients mustve been, I wont be back."
0,"I hope this resort is better than their sister property.  I am staying at the Tapatio Cliffs Resort right now and my car was spray painted last night. All the windows and profanity on the back. After talking with several people, a manager, security, etc., the only thing I was told in paraphrase was we cant do anything, but an insurance claim has been made, and that these things happen.. Not anything to compensate, to make me feel secure that this wont happen again, nothing. I am being treated like some idiot who is paying money to be here for several days and thats it. If you want to make sure you are secure and want a staff that works hard to make sure you are satisfied, I suggest not staying here. They are horrible and have done absolutely nothing. This is not the Hilton brand standard and I am appalled as a paying customer I am being treated this way. DO NOT STAY HERE."
0,Shame on you Adam Richmond for having this place featured on Man Vs. Food.  This is the only reason I went there a little while back.  nnThe place is horrible.  No good food to speak of.

0,"Im torn on how to review this restaurant. Given the lack of choices in da Burgh for Brazilian steakhouses, I might rate it  stars. Compared to other Texas de Brazil locations I have tried, this restaurant rates  star. Over all, I decided to average it out at . It isnt at all bad, but it should be much better.nnOther reviews have covered the experience so Ill stick to what didnt work, and then mention the things that did.nnThe salad bar is nice, but not half the size of what is normally offered at a Texas de Brazil. I will sometimes opt for just the salad bar, but this one doesnt have the selection. Usually I would tell vegetarians they could eat here and be happy, Im not sure I would recommend this location.nnMeat is the star of the show. It was sadly lacking here. The meat we got was good, but they had maybe half as many gauchos as normal. The experience is supposed to be like a meat parade  the meat comes in so many cuts and options, and so fast, that you cant keep up, and very quickly have to flip your card over to say youve had enough, at least for now. Here that never happened. The meats came around so infrequently we nearly always sat with an empty plate before the next gaucho came around. nnOf the advertised cuts of meat, we saw just about half in the time we were there. Usually picanha is rotated through frequently, but here it came by only twice. Flank and leg of lamb came by once. We were offered filet, chicken, and sausage many times.nnAlso, at the beginning they ask if there is any specific cut you like, and we said beef ribs, which is our favorite. When we were ready to leave, they still had not come out so we asked again. They did come out, but the meat was dried out and not very appetizing. nnHigh points were my caipirinha, the lobster bisque, and Ill give them bonus points for the fact three different people asked us if we liked our table or if we would like to move. nnThe experience was summed up by my boyfriend asking at the end of the meal if I could take him someplace else for his birthday, since this wasnt quite what he was hoping for."
0,"In Vegas, you are always going to get a little lost in a casino.  So yeah, youre going to ask for directions from time to time.nnOnly once have I been to Stratosphere.  Upon entry, I had no idea where I was going and was supposed to meet with my friends who were staying there in the hotel.  I asked for directions, and the response I got from a woman who worked there was less than friendly.  She basically said, Just read the signs! and pointed to them in a very rude way.  I was stunned at her lack of customer service skills.  My first thought, Thanks for trying to make me feel like an idiot.nnVery bad FIRST IMPRESSION.nnRoom serice was awesome though.  room service available...got waffles at  am.  They werent too bad, either."
0,"You are better off going anywhere else.  This Rio Carnival buffet used to be great because they were the first to offer so much and with big variety, but now all the hotels do.  The food was good of course, but for that price you can get just as good food if not better somewhere else AND with better service.  The star rating is for the horrible service.  Our table and seats had food crumbs all over them and we didnt get asked what we wanted to drink or even water for over  minutes.  We had no idea who our server even was!  It wasnt even crowded either. We tipped the bus boy who took our plates away since he was nice and doing all the work anyway.  We probably should have asked for the manager but didnt want to make a stink, so sorry to bother you serverinthesectionwewereseated, we wont be going again."
0,"This place is a joke. I ordered eggplant and chicken but had to pay an up charge of a  for the chicken. I get it back to my office just to have  small minced pieces of chicken in my dish! I wish I had taken a picture because it was unbelievable. I returned to the restaurant to show them and the lady at the register understand my frustration but the owner was yelling at me like a red headed step child. She said what do you expect for a dollar?!?!? I said CHICKEN! I told her I wouldve gladly paid more money for chicken but at least inform your customers a  doesnt get you chicken but literally a piece of chicken. All I wanted was chicken in my dish, is that too much to ask for?!??? The owner kept yelling at me with her mouth full, disgusting!"

0,"WOW...very rude team.  Brought in the vacuum  weeks ago to be looked at.  They called and we authorized  of work.  One week from the call passes and the phone at  pm on a Friday night from a manager stating can you come in a pickup your vacuum, we have  vacuums here and have a fire safety issue.  Stated could pick it up on Monday, then asked if someone we know could pick it up tonight.  Informed them this was the first time theyve call to say it was ready.  The response, thats no true, I watched someone dial your number a few days ago.  Informed no, thats not true.  Did they leave a voicemail.  Response, I dont know, maybe we dialed the wrong number, can you pick up your vacuum tonight.  Again, no and asked what they did.  Advised more work than we authorized including a new roller.  When asked, did it need a new roller?  The response, get this, I dont know we always recommend a roller when someone brings in a vacuum if over  years old.   Me, its less than  years old.  Her, well we just always recommend it.  REALLY?  So...you just ask customers to pay for something that isnt needed?????  And you admit it...really?  Will NOT buy another vacuum cleaner from this store nor have anything serviced here. So, if you want someone to be rude and charge you for something you might not need, I highly recommend this store and specifically working with Deanna."
0,"This is one of the worst places Ive ever eaten before.nnMy wife and I love asian food, and we wanted to try something out of our ordinary restaurants. Big mistake.nnThe food was cold, underseasoned, bland, and poorly prepared. The chicken was tough, the egg rolls were burnt and had very old ingredients for filling. The shrimp smelled old and so we didnt risk eating it.nnThe staff was extremely rude lots of younger girls, and spent most of the time behind our table fighting, gossiping, and being very loud while rolling napkins. They also said many things in English about the customers in the restaurant that were very inappropriate for any environment.nnWould NOT visit again, EVER!"
0,"I have been to this place twice, because my mom forgot our horrible experience here the first time, and have not liked it both times.  Their pricing is outrageous, their service is awful and the way they treat their customers is terrible.  nnDuring my expensive pedicure, that the man on the phone told my mom was cheaper, there were no chairs for me to start my gel manicure.  So, she started doing it while I sat in the pedicure chair.  I had to hold my arm up so that the woman could do it, it was ridiculous and lasted for about  minutes.nnShe also mumbled something to me and then walked away.  Later I realized she asked if she could take her heels off and WEAR my flip flops to walk around.  I saw her taking off MY SHOES as we went up to the bar to finish my nails.  How gross is that?  And how unprofessional?!!!nnDont go here, its WAY overpriced and the staff are jerks!"
0,"This place has a complex about what ethnicity is it. Plaid skirts are Scottish, food from the U.K. only includes Northern Ireland, and the boxty this place served me came in a potato tortilla. Really. just like at the Old Town Tortilla Factory. For the record, boxty isnt entirely irish. In fact with the exception of a burger and mash potatoes, nothing on this menu would appear on a menu in ireland, not even at the airport. nand even if boxty was a reguarly served food there, its always done poperly by shredding potatoes. Thats in fact the only part of the dish that makes it the dish. That aside, even what what in our boxty was gross. I didnt expect a lot, but this place dissapoints."
0,"Im only giving this place two stars because the customer service was great.nnOverall the hotel itself is a little outdated.  The TV, phone and clock are up to date but everything else was not.  Its a very clean room, nothing majorly wrong with it.nnThe downside is that the walls are paper thin.  We were just having a conversation and security knocks on the door telling us to lower the volume.  Lower the volume on what? So if you are a person with a loud voice, dont even bother staying here because the next night around pm, we get a call.  I didnt even bother answering because I figured it was the asshole racist security guard.  They have pre conceived notions that African Americans cant afford places like this buuuut your the one whose a rentacop! I guess he had to feel big about himself since he might lack in other areas.nnIve stayed at the Ritz in downtown LA and that place was top notch,  stars compared to this place.  Just because your in the Biltmore area, does not mean you have class. I doubt Ill come back here because I like to have conversations and not remain silent if Im not under arrest Mr. RentACop!"
0,"Ill admit from the get go, I understand  Chinese buffets are not where one would go for gourmet chinese but this place wasnt even really GOOD.nnThe selection was seemingly okay, hardly any vegetable or vegetarian options actually outside of desserts, green beans and some fruit I dont think there was any.  They advertised sushiwhich I rarely venture beyond a California roll at most buffets but the closest thing to sushi was cooked mussels on a half shell  or shrimp on ice.nnAll in all as far as food goes it wasnt even in the realm of good.  My husband had some Orange Chicken and claimed it was bland and nothing orange about it.  Most of the meat was fatty and blah flavored.  I was okay with the food at first bc they had green beans, I could eat plates full of green beans normally.  These were wrinkled and withered looking but I marched on...truly wish I hadnt!  They were more like bark covered twigs pretending to be green beans!nnFor the good they seated us promptly, got us drinks and made sure they were full the whole time, place seemed clean enough.  Although I cant attest for the bathrooms since we never used them."
0,"Im going to give them two stars because they quoted me a price over the phone for an extraction, and after I got there they wanted to charge me twice as from what was originally quoted. They ended up doing a procedure that was less expensive than an extraction to help me get out of pain and also buy me some time so I could save up to get  root canals. The procedure didnt work and actually made my pain worse. I asked for them to pull at least one tooth out since I paid for a procedure that didnt work, and they wanted to charge me an extra  for the extraction. The dentist made me feel a little uncomfortable, as I know I have some issues with my teeth. He did a good job at making me feel very embarrassed. However, he did provide me with some pain medication which was very helpful. I was eternally grateful for that. Just wish they wouldnt quote a price over the phone and then make up some excuse when you get into the office to double the price."

0,"Im writing this review after what started off as a good experience turned incredibly lack luster.  I took my friend here last night for her bday and wanted some grub and good craft beers. It was a busy Saturday night with a wait, so we opted to eat dinner at the bar top.  The food was mediocre and the service was rather good, at first.  After two beers I was feeling a little bloated and decided to end the night with a cocktail, trouble is our server disappeared.  I sat there with a noticeably empty glass for over ten minutes. I located our server in the corner singing and dancing and yucking it up with coworkers and then with one particular male customer he must tip well.  Finally the other bartender came close to us but only made conversation with the male customer next to us again I was still sitting there, glass completely empty.  Finally I decided it was enough and just put my card down to pay, and of course that took another  minutes of waiting around.  Look, Im fine with the wait staff having a good time in fact I encourage it, however this shouldnt come at the expense at the customers experience.  I work in the service industry and expect a good experience I wont be back here for awhile after last night."
0,"Well since i bashed it last night i had to give this one another try. Havent been to the Rampart buffet in years but my memory was pretty negative about this place. Recently the only reason ive gone is because the cafe was closed so the only option was the buffets breakfast section. nnThis time my expectations were exceeded but not greatly. Food was ok but their presentation is very dismal, i guess i cant expect anything else from a buffet, but more rotations? and no empty platters would help a lot. The salad was empty, fruit was almost gone so i came back for dessert and luckily it was refilled.nnPretty much a decent standard overall. Ive been to worse casino buffets and much better ones, but for the  dollar price this one is acceptable. If in the mood for prime rib, salmon and other randomly combined things this place works.nnMost selection was probably with the desserts, but we were disappointed with no strawberries or bananas, pm and all that was available was boring marshmallows. nnSidenote all you hear in the cafe is the slot machines, in the buffet all we heard was the irish pub across the hall, but that depends on time of day im sure"
0,"One thing I know for sure I am definitely NOT On the Border about this place and I am a big believer in second chances when on the fence.nnMy spouse and I got  worth of Chilis gift cards for Christmas and after quickly getting tired of their offerings decided to try some of the other places that take their gift cards. After all, we werent paying for it out of own pockets so taking a chance on new place could be fun. On the Border was one of the places that took the gift card so I looked up their menu online and thought it sounded promising. So off we went with empty stomachs and high hopes of finding another great location in our neck of the woods. nnWe were initially pleased with the decor and cleanliness. It was around  so it wasnt too crowded  maybe  cars in the lot. In fact we were the only ones originally seated in our area most of the other people were in the Cantina area. I am wondering if this accounts for the poor service we received. Our drink orders water were taken and we were given a basket of overly salted chips and salsa while we looked over the menus. Our water glasses came about  minutes later when we were ready to order. I immediately drank the whole thing while the server was still there and remarked how thirsty the salty chips made me and requested a refill.nnThey were running an AllYouCanEatEnchilada special so we decided to try that. I took one bite of my beef enchilada and decided that was ALL I could eat! Admittedly my spouses cheese and onion was slightly better but he agreed that hed never order them again. The rice and beans that accompanied them were edible but still in the meh category. Our server checked on us once to see if we were ready for another serving no thanks! Our water glasses were never refilled so I had to resort to the water bottle in my purse. We decided not to waste any more of our gift certificate on dessert. nnNOTE It surprises me that in a servicedriven economy like that of Las Vegas which is suffering from high levels of unemployment, that some servers who are fortunate to still have work dont apply themselves more to making their guests experience a good one. I am a highly generous tipper when I get superior service, even when I didnt love my meal. Furthermore, because the unemployment here is so high, these food industries should have the pick of the crop when hiring and training employees so there is no excuse for poor service regardless of the poor meal."
0,"Im writing this hour after Ive experienced all the hype.nnI had expectations for this place from all the reviews and a friend reassuring me its the best in town... if thats the best in town its a pretty slack standard...nnThe service is good. The hostess was prompt, a little unorganized, confusing the order of names for people waiting to be seated, which could have been solved by simply using numbers... Dont fire her for this shes cute.nnJokes aside lets get down to what was not impressive.nnWhile getting seated I ordered their soft shell crab appetizer, as recommended by a fellow yelper. Disappointed that it was heavily breaded, overcooked, it wasnt a nice golden brown, but a darkborderline singed brown, the sauce that accompanied it didnt compliment it all. I decided to just hastily consume the food and down it with my drink.nnI love spicy tuna and its many variations, but was extremely disappointed at how flat it tasted! No tang, no kick, no flavor, just the rice. Moving onto the soft shell crab, theres was no prominence in its taste, the crab lacked significant flavor to make me say, hey this is crab!  it tastes great! None of that.nnMoving to my third  fourth set, came the devil  the you the man rolls, the devil roll flat out failed when it touched my palate why give it such a name if it fails to deliver. The next roll faired a little better, its doesnt go all the way to impress but stops short of uncertainty. The jalapeno sauce gives it a mild tinge of attitude, but for its contents, it just doesnt hit the mark.nnMan Whore. The idea of taking a sushi and coating it with cheese and throwing it in the oven was most appealing. The first roll went down smoothly and I thought this night was going to turn with this roll. Come the second roll it just abruptly ended with a wtf! I suddenly found myself trying to figure out the weird mound of meat on top of my roll, wth is it exactly, cutting cornerscost using ground beefporkchicken? Wheres the fish? Why does it feel like Im eating someones leftovers...nnLast roll for the night. Before calling it a night  grabbing my disgusting check, I was greeted by my final plate, dubbed the No Name by the person making my sushi. Tuna  Salmon wrapped in a green something...assuming this is lettuce, coated with jalapeno sauce  God knows what else. As this was a custom creation, it felt that it had more character  creativity involved, it was a well balanced morsel, a hint tang, a mild spike and a dash of sweetness. Thank you for that Mr.JunnnIn closing, wth youre still reading this...go find another sushi place if youre looking for something special or something that doesnt taste flat."

New plan  Pre Fixe lunch menu at Social House.nnThis is a contemporary, strangely adorned restaurant located in Crystals. The restaurant itself was basically empty when my friend and I entered and were greeted by the hostess. We were sat in the dining room which espouses some kind of odd bordellobird nest vibe. I say bird nest, because the enormous lighting fixtures above the dining room resembled bird nests made of hair. Take that as you will.nnOur waiter Daniel arrived and took our drink order. Ice water was ordered and we were delivered room temperature water. Daniel scurried around the restaurant taking care of other tables and disappearing while my friend and I decided upon our Pre Fixe meals. Many minutes later Daniel returned to take our order. nnDaniel insisted the Locomoco was just hamburger on rice with gravy. No really, its just hamburger that is after we asked what the entree was and how it tasted. Nice sell, Daniel. Oh and he did beseechingly tell us, Its a Hawaiian dish. Mm hmm. nnOrdered nnGreen Tea . Obviously this green tea must have been produced from rainbows from a pandas ass, because never in my life will I ever pay for Green Tea that is  ever again.

As sad as it is to say I felt as though I cooked the chicken in this dish because I ALWAYS overcook chicken. The pickled veggies in the dish were lost on me because I dont eat pickled anything.nnSalmon Roll  Decent. My favorite part of the whole meal. Wish Id just gotten sushi for the whole meal. Although the rolls were on the minuscule side no wonder, this place is in Crystals on the Strip. nnFood  Mediocre at best, perhaps dinner is better?nDecor  Bordello Bird NestnService  Hope Daniel enjoyed his tip as much as he enjoyed being our server, as in, not much."

The guy at the fitting room seemed as if we were an inconvenience to him. And now weve been waiting in line for more than  minutes, when we only had about  people in front of us.

To quote the most interesting man in the world I dont always write reviews, but when I do....its important. nn        Im writing about my AWFUL experience in dealing with Marks cleaners. I will attempt so do so succinctly as possible. I dropped off an order SPECIFICALLY to be picked up next day because I was leaving out of town. I made it abundantly clear that I needed it next day for a very important trip. This entire conversation occurred with Brian the manager. I made it clear that I would be a new customer if everything went well and the service was quality. He said no problem come back tomorrow anytime after .nn      The next day I show up and the fun begins. My order of course was not completed. The ladies there were in a daze and could not locate my clothes. Everything was so unorganized it was a mess. Finally, we narrowed down the few spots the shirts could be. I then had to locate them myself because they had no system of keeping track of them. The only problem with that was the shirts wear soaking in this solution that was in the back of the facility. The conditions were deplorable. It was really just an awful experience to have to personally find my clothes in this heaping pile of filth. After  mins I located all  of my shirts. They were completely soaked! Long story short I took them home with the help of the ladies that were working there. I gave them my card and told them that I expect a call from Brian. nn       Long story short I spend  hours cleaning my shirts at home, learning how to launder my really pricy custom shirts at home with a conventional washer dry. It was certainly an adventure i will never forget. nn     Upon returning from my trip I realized I had never received a call. I call Brian The excuse of a Manager to see how he could try to resolve my awful experience.  This guy had noting. All he said was  Im sorry and  I dont know what else to tell you. Completely apathetic to the awful predicament  this established put me in. I had left one tie there because we couldnt find it originally. He didnt even offer to give me a discount for the dry cleaned tie. He charged me  for the tie. nn        In conclusion, its not that fact they made a mistake, or the fact that conditions were awful, or even that Brian was a royal douche. What really made this one of the worst business transactions for me was the mishandling at every step, and the unwillingness to make things right.  I hate writing reviews but this one had to be done in such detail because of the egregious errors in customer service.  Anybody knows thats eventually mistakes will happen at the dry cleaners, but their willingness to fix the situation is what separates the good from the bad."
0,Ho hum! Spent  using the groupon for  yard drinks....with alcohol..... instead I got a slushie! After sipping my juice for a while and noticing I wasnt getting a buzz I threw mines away! Word of advice go to FAT TUESDAYS at least you get a buzz! If I wanted a slushie I would go to the .
0,"Bad from the start. Dirty silverware, really dirty table. The waitress seemed bothered that I asked her to wipe the table down. The food either over or under cooked. Overall a horrible first time experience...waited about  minutes to talk to manager but she couldnt tear herself away from chatting with some friends so I left."
0,"I ordered my  med Pizzas at pm one day because my Lunch started at .  I figured  minutes would be plenty of time for me to drive by and pick it up, especially when my confirmation stated the estimated time would be  minutes.  I actually left for lunch at  because I lost track of time.  nnWhen I showed up at , the delivery driver and the male cashier were both just chatting.  I had to WAIT to pay.  Not only that, but my food was not ready.  They said they were stil waiting for one more to be finished.  From the cash register you can see inside of the Oven and there was not  pizza in there.  nnI sat and waited another  minutes.  I was extremely polite.  When they finally finished my pizza at pm.  With NOT EVEN AN APOLOGY, they handed me my pizzas.  nnI am VERY dissappointed with this store.  I spent half of my lunch waiting for food that took  hour and  minutes to complete."
0,"Ive had Rosatis from several locations in Phoenix. At my house I have two stores within range and when I am at my friends we order Rosatis near them.nOrdered a Pan style.nThe ingredients are very good as they are at every Rosatis Ive ordered from and it actually arrived without the top of the pizza sliding all to one side... Kudos the the delivery guy.nnHowever, I counted six  tomato tops in the sauce on the pieces I grabbed. In my opinion it completely ruined my experience. The tops I am referring to are where the stem connects to the tomato. That little piece of stem ruined it for me. One maybe....six????"
0,"I do not recommend this nail salon. I had gel nails done with white tips. They were so bad that I went back the next day to have them redone. They still werent as good as they should be but I just said Id never go back. I do have a picture, but Im not sure it shows how bad they were. The white tips lines were not strait."
0,"Came here last night with a couple of girlfriends. just bar hopping and I saw this place and remembered it had great reviews on yelp I was excited to try it out although my older sister said the cocktails were really just ok. I wanted to try it out myself. nLoved the layout and the whole feel to the place. Music was loud, dim lights, bathrooms were clean.nIm going to try to keep this short because i could go into every little detail. I got an extra extra dirty martini. My friend got some watermelon cucumber martini. There were  of us.  Before I could tell him, I want ketel one Robert walked away. My girlfriends did not like his attitude with us so decided not to order. he was really impatient and giving us attitude when we were looking over the menu.  Im so oblivious to people sometimes lol but hey I just wanted to have a good night. n They were busy, but nothing crazy. My friends wanted to go to another place, so I walked up to him on the other side of the bar and yelled Sir  Im sorry I was just wondering if our drinks were started. Robert then seemed really annoyed and said yes. Then rolled his eyes. I was definitely taken back and found it extremely rude. Of course we took the drinks, but i didnt see anything wrong with canceling them if he hadnt started making them. I honestly dont know if it was because the way we were dressed or how we spoke to him. I felt like he looked down on us. Maybe he didnt think we would tip or spend a lot of money. I have no clue. He was really nice to other people sitting at the bar, but treated us differently.  anyways Watermelon cucumber was pretty good, but mine was Not extra extra dirty. It was actually pretty gross, but I was already upset with the service. I just wanted to leave. I took a few sips and left. I ended up tipping but honestly i wish I wouldnt have. I serve and I hate leaving a bad tip even if  the service was shitty.  But he did it for me. There are better cocktails at Martini bar oh and you wont be treated like shit either."
0,"We spent over  dollars to have an amazing birthday party for my  year old at the Childrens Museum. During this time we purchased a family membership for the year so me and my ex could both take our daughter. When we purchased a family pass they never mentioned that my ex and I had to be in the same household to use the pass and we have successfully enjoyed the museum many times on our pass before today. When my daughter and I tried to use the pass today a very rude woman working the front counter told us that we had to be in the same household to use the pass and I could be put on as a nanny if my ex showed up to approve it. Excuse me? I am the MOTHER not a nanny and I was greatly offended. I cant even believe she said that! I cant believe they would rather me lie and say I was my daughters nanny then tell the truth that I am her mother, but she has two homes one with her dad and one with me.nnWe have been coming to the museum for years and it just left a bad taste in my mouth the entire visit. There are so many families that are split up and I should not have to have my daughter embarrassed at the front counter of a museum because her family is different than a traditional family. I am so disappointed and I really hope when I call a manager on Tuesday that there is an apology or we will never spend another dime at this discriminatory establishment!"
0,Its a sandwich place. Average bread. Average sandwiches. I doubt if they make their own bread there. Went there for breakfast sandwiches and they didnt have breakfast ingredients. nnOverpriced for what you get. Weve had better from a real bread place. nnShould have gone to one of the local buffets instead...
0,"First off... know that you will be charged another  dollars just to PARK!. Basic ticket price is . per person everyone over  yrs. Is it worth it? a reluctant yea.. there are a lot of interactive games and displays. I bought tickets  weeks ago, and was so excited that it was opening here, just a mile away! If the tickets were a little cheaper I would go again, but now its off my bucket list, im not going back. A lot of work and thought went into this event, nicely done and great staff. Bring a jacket, its cold throughout. Bring the kids, its more for them. I was told it was targeted to the adults, but that was lacklustered for my tastes. First room they have you stand in front of a green screen for a picture, but give you no input on how or what it is for, they need to put samples of the three backdrop pictures up front so you can have a small idea of the finish product. They have cafe food onsite, which we didnt try, there is a lot to take in, you can spent a quite of a bit of time just reading everything. Yes there are restrooms inside outside available. My biggest disappointment is that I was expecting props from the Marvel movies, and backdrops, more museum type pieces, there was none. The simulators that held my interest were the HoloBlaster Training Simulator and the Black Widow Agility Maze. There was an Avengers Encounter that would not work at all for me, maybe because I was wearing dark clothes and black jacket, so the computer had a hard time in seeing my movements, not sure. At times it just seemed hokey, goodhearted but hokey, and you reflect on the money you spent to walk through. The Marvel Experience collects a LOT of information about you, and get ready to input your email address in their interactive displays everywhere. I own a couple restaurants and maybe I should start charging a  per car fee since youre already spending money at my place? That is sooo retarded, shame on you for not putting that in your website, or with ticketmaster. I carry just credit cards anymore... you need to bring cold hard cash and lots of it."
0,"Saw the groupon and called to make an appointment but next available was over  weeks out.  I figured they were simply busier than normal because of the groupon however when tried again a few weeks later they still had over a  week wait.  Really glad I did not purchase the groupon.  If you want new customers then you should really be prepared to provide a reasonable time frame.  I can understand up to  days, but  weeks is excessive for summer in Arizona."

0,"Came here for breakfast and had a mixed experience.  I had their  Cinnamon  roll French toast and thought it was delicious.  Everything went down hill from there. nnI thought it was great that Black Bear offered a smaller size omelet for those not looking to have a large meal.  My wife ordered a small ham and cheese omelet and we were both shocked when we saw the hideous thing that was brought out.  It was two fried eggs with unmelted cheese and uncooked ham on top of it.  We sent it back to get melted. After they microwaved it, the dish became extremely greasy and salty.  It was gross.  Also, our sodas were flat and overly sweet with syrup.  nnThe French toast earned  of the  stars back after they lost all there stars on the omelet."
0,"Check in is pm check out is at am. We got the bora bora suite and the refrigerator didnt work. We called to get it fixed but no one went to fix it. After the first call they never answered the front desk again. We were unable to contact any staff via the rooms phone. I went down to talk to someone. The guy said hed be right back and walked away. I literally stood in the lobby waiting for  minutes. nnIf you plan on checking in earlier, forget about it. Check in is at .  strictly enforced. If youre a younger couple or have kids, forget about it. Old folks only. And its not on the strip, but it is conveniently right under the flight path for the airport."
0,"Great family spot.  I mainly picked this place because of the lazy river and pools.  I can say this is great if you have kids, but not a fan of the service or pool rules.  Let me explain.nnI wanted to relax in the pool with my kids and family, but who can when kids are throwing footballs and even some  somethings think its cool so they take up the whole pool to throw footballs.  Not really relaxing in the pool when you are dodging footballs and whatever else they have.  I heard some other couples complaining to each other as they hugged the sides of the pool, but what can you do?  Its ok to do this here.  nnAnother issue I had was slow service for drinks and food via the pool.  Even with a waiter we waited  minutes for our  drink order?  I ordered a blue moon so its not like it had to be mixed.  The food arrived  minutes later.  nnSo even though I liked the pools, not the ball throwing and allowable horseplay.  nnNext be prepared to wait, both days I was in the pool was such a wait, that I had to order directly from the bar to get service.  Yes the Marriot gave me  to spend on food and drinks, but it was an inconvenience at the pool.nnHope your stay is better, but I plan on staying at a relaxing resort next time."
0,"Coffee is fine, although I agree with Laura F. below. Service has always been VERY slow, despite  baristas working at the counter. Id recommend not stopping here on your way to work, but its an OK place to pick up a latte on the weekend or get a bottle of wine."
0,"Mothers day wrecked.  Thanks Ricos.  I called ahead, asked of outdoor seating in the shade, mentioned that I need two booster seats. Well.... They sat us in the sun, had one booster seat and had to send out to another restaurant for another... That one arrived and had broken supports.  The manager could not be bothered, and the manager above her was a boring guy who did not seem to care.  It was so bad that our server cried at the table.  I am not kidding.nnThe bar is where I usually go, and well.... They dont mess up beer."
0,"If I could give them zero, I would!  nnWaked in and was face to face with two girls at the Hostess stand having a personal conversation that was clearly more important than two hungry customers with cash to spend on food and lots of beer.nnFinally got sat...one, two, three times the waitress passed by without so much as an acknowledgement.  So we pulled aside one of the many girls not doing anything and asked if she could help.  She couldnt.  But, she got us a different girl who also said she couldnt help, but, would find our waitress.nn minutes passed without even a drink order taken.  We even stared right at the manager with desperate, hungry, thirsty faces to no avail.   minutes in we left and went to Pin Kow where we are always welcome!nnI wonder if our waitress even ever came?  LOL."
0,"Our first interaction in Holsteins came via our douchetastic waiter who, upon our sitting, proclaimed, HEY! WHATS UP???! My English boss, with his best sarcastic manners, responded, Well, hello?nnThough I didnt catch his name, waitermanboy was annoying and slow. He never brought the promised samples of beer, proclaimed Boddingtons an English bitter was a whitewit beer and took so long to bring extra cranberry sauce for the sawdustdry turkey burger I ate, it was long choked down before he reappeared.nnBeyond service, the food wasnt substantial, but some in our party loved their burgers.nnKettle Chips  like any other kettle chip.nSouthern Fried Chicken FingersnWaffles  Nice crisp to the chicken, syrup was warm and the waffle was.... well, a waffle.nNew England Turkey  Avoid.

0,"Worst service Ive ever got. Waited  min to sit with no line another  to get our menus ordered drinks and food, while eating I swear on my life a roach ran across the floor and by the time we finished our meals our  drinks came, I wish I was making this stuff up, worst place ever!"
0,I deleted my original review on Yelp to repost. I had originally given this place  stars and it seems like Im going to be the first person to bump it down. Thus Im not sure if the poor quality of my gel manicure that is making me repost only happened to me. The gel manicure I got barely lasted  weeks and started peeling easily. Im disappointed because this place is expensive and I feel like I didnt get my moneys worth. Doesnt seem like any one else has had a bad experience but Im not going to be back.
0,"My friends and I stopped here for dinner on a Monday night before going to Thunder From Down Under for some bachelorette party fun. We wanted to carb up and then go drink profusely, but that ended up not really happening because a couple of us felt really sick after eating here!nnGiven such, this is probably one of the worst buffets Ive ever been to. It cost about  for one person with no alcohol, which is pretty standard for a midrange buffet in Vegas. However, there were barely any choices. There was a sad little carving station, a lot of salad and pasta, some sad looking sushi rolls, and a couple of extra protein options. I didnt even look at the desserts due to lack of interest in the place overall. nnAlso, be warned, I think at least  of us in my group of  that ate there got mild food poisoning. Havent talked to the other girls yet, so the rate could be higher. nnDefinitely wont be coming back here."
0,"After being glued to the blackjack table for  hours, my friend and I decided that we needed to fuel our system before we continued on our money making spree.nnWe couldnt really decide what we wanted yet so we were asking the waitress questions. We were going to share and so I asked the waitress how big the serving for fried rice is. She said its a serving for  person only and did the a small bowl sign.nnWe ended up ordering a fried rice, a noodle soup and a roll.nnFirst off, the fried rice was not a serving size, it could have served  or more people. Second, the roll said it had tempura which was nowhere to be found. An ant would not even be able to find it.nThird, the food was just watevers. Ive worked in many sushi restaurants and to pay triple the price for something that doesnt even taste half as good is pretty saddening. Never coming back here again.nnLastly, the waitress didnt even check on us once. It seemed like she doesnt know her portions very well. I am a waitress myself so I would understand if it was busy but seriously... Crickets....nnJust a warning, expect to pay a lot for something thats not very good!!"
0,"I enjoyed the space when it was Las Ramblas, but our night out at Sunset was unremarkable.  We started with the goat cheese app...really very good.  But our entrees were meh.  I had the vegetable stack...ok, but a little over spiced.  My friend ordered the burrito at the recommendation of our waiter.  It was so spicy she couldnt eat it.  After she sent it back, it took at least  min to receive the sandwich shed chosen instead.  Service was lacking.  I think we got checked on twice.  It wasnt horrible, just really not impressed.  I can see having a better time ordering apps and wine at the large bar in the center of the room."
0,"They have done more to piss people off with a Groupon they dont honor.  Would have been better off not having a Groupon.  We only had  people instead of  so they refused to honor the Groupon.  Hello people,  would eat less and it would cost you less.  Rude manager!  Offered to give me  I paid not  value.  We left and I will get a refund from Groupon.  Talk about bait and switch!!!!  Plus they have way too many table shoved together, felt like I was sitting with the people next to me."
0,The food was tasty and the people were nice but they serve everything on styrofoam and use all plastic utensils.

0,"I had been there before and loved it, but this time took a friend. I could see that business has expanded ...I think too quickly. The Olive tour has turned into a sales pitch for all of the items that are being carried.nnI remember ranting and raving about the food. It was not the same this time at all, I had the roast beef Panini and it was soggy and had very little roast beef in it, just not a good sandwich.nnOverall,  I would not go back. I have been there about four times previously but it has changed."
0,"went here because we had a free drink coupon....Service SUCKED!!!!  The only reason this review is getting two stars is because the food was not that bad.  The restarant had had more emplyees than customers, but is still took forever to get our drinks......we were sitting right next to the bar, so I was able to time the bar tender.....wow there were two of them and they were both SLLLOOOOWWWW..... There was no music, It was the afternoon so I did not expect LIVE music, but someone could have plugged in the IPod and payed some blues for ambience!!  Would I go again.....Probably not unless I absolutely needed a fried pickle fix...."
0,"Started off pleasant enough, except for the fact that there was a summer rain outside, so the muggy air conditioning in the Encore felt more like a swamp cooler. Was seated quickly in this cafe just off the casino floor. Ordered the pulled pork sliders. Got through the first two just fine. Bit into the third to find my teeth chomping on something hard. I removed the halfinch by  inch object from the sandwich. It was an OLIVE PIT. There were no olives in the slider. I told the waiter. She immediately took it to the kitchen. She came back and apologized, then told me that the chef said there was no way an olive pit could get into the meat. I didnt just dream that it was there! She asked if I wanted anything else. My appetite was gone, so No Thank you. Then the Manager stopped at the table across from me. He asked them if they had the sliders. They said no. He looked puzzeled and looked around at the tables in the area, including ours. My daughter was still eating her lunch, but my plate was gone. Still he could not figure out that I was the guy who had the sliders. He didnt go back to check with the server. He never came over to us to apologize. They removed the item from my bill, which was the least they could do. I didnt get hurt, so I wasnt looking for more, except for them to show a bit more concern.nDamn, I should have taken a picture!"
0,"My stay at Hotel San Carlos was mostly based on price and lack of availability at more well known chains, so I wasnt sure what to expect.  I really wasnt impressed and I wouldnt stay there again.nnUpon arrival at about pm, I was told my room wouldnt be ready until pm.  Nothing like waiting until the last minute to clean it up!  I asked for the wifi password and got some work done in the tiny lobby while I waited.nnIf youre looking for old world charm, this is the place for you.  Priding itself on having hosted Marilyn Monroe, and that it is one of the most haunted hotels in America, somehow this hotel wins guests over despite the small old rooms with tiny bathrooms and musty smells.  nnTo be fair, the hotel was a place to lie my head, and I did have a good sleep.  However, it wasnt as comfortable a stay as I would have had at a newer hotel.  The shower was a tiny stall with a curtain, which wasnt sufficient when the shower head started spraying all over the bathroom due to a slight leak.nnI will also say that the rooftop pool was okay.  It had a lot of seating and was better than some others in the city.nnIf youre looking to step back in time, this is the hotel for you!"
0,"Poor customer service.nnI went to Michaels buy metallic markers. They were behind glass and there was not a single employee to be found. After. Quite some time, I had to go to another department to have someone paged over.nnWe they finally came, opened the case, and found my marker, the lady held it up at me as if to hand it to me. When I tried to take it. She didnt let go. She then rudely told me I had to get them at the front. Keep in mind, Im a grown lady and not some young thug. Never the less,  her tone and look made me feel like a common criminal.nnI will never come to this Michaels again!"
0,"Went here on a Saturday night for dinner before a night out in Vegas. To be honest the setting is great  nice lofty, extravagant restaurant feel you want when youre in Vegas but the food was just a bit meh and the worst thing was the airconditioning. We had to ask to be moved to a more central table just to get body heat off the rest of the diners and we saw other tables do the same or put their jackets back on. nnWe were a group of  and share  pizzas and  salads  which were all just ok. The pizzas were fairly dry as they only seemed to use chopped tomatoes as a sauce base rather than any passata and the salads were measly for around  a pop!nnIt was Ok but I wouldnt rush back."
0,My bro told me about this place to get me to start vaping and quit smoking. This place is near my part of town so I drove down there on  to get me started on vaping. When I walked in I was greeted then a girl went to help me. I told her that I smoke and wanted to start vaping. She showed me the most expensive kit and I told her I was on a budget and when I have enough money Ill eventually upgrade. She acted like come on buy the thing and go type of look. As any first vapor would get I got the PSV  ecig which looks like a cig. So she showed me how to fill it and the one I tried was working but she didnt check to see if everything works. I got home and tried charging my other battery so it will be set for when the one Im vaping dies. The battery would not charge so the next week when I have money I go back down and tell them the battery was DOA and they acted like the lady who sold it would be talked to. Didnt happen anyway they replaced my battery and I bought a few more juices. A week later my battery wont work so I go back in with my receipt and the first thing out of the guys mouth is you cant keep bringing back batteries expecting to get a new one for free at this point I felt like there was no respect or customer service. Even though I was dissapointed I bought their ego kit which was  I did get a free ml bottle of eliquid. At this point I think I gave up going there to buy ejuice and other stuff. I did some research and I now been buying stuff online from other vendors. Now as far as juices it seems like pink spot dont have great tasting juices at all since I went to a different vendor. Pink spot juice is not that flavorful and their flavors fade. Im just going to say this pink spot has a nice shop but as far as customer service it sux and is a poor attitude. There is only  person I would actually talk to and he takes his time and helps explain stuff. So would I recommend this place to newbies no maybe veterans if they want to try new ejuice but that is about it.
0,"Just went from  to  stars bc they dont recycle!  An entire restaurant, imagine their impact.  Not to mention their whole concept is healthy and earth conscious at this place one of the kids books they have is about recycling!, but all their plastic cups go to a landfill.  What a disappointment and hypocrisy! No wifi btw!nnOld review nSo, I go a lot and my new fave salad is the Mediterranean I tell them light dressing bc they really can overdo it, and the Spicy Salmon entree.  Also, I like the soups the chicken tortilla is fabulous but I found the Pho, Veggie Bean Soup, and the Coconut Curry a bit too salty.  nnHealthy, delicious, great staff and service, and really it does not get better.  MY FAVE and the best salad ever  Quinoa Salad!  Add chicken for protein.  Great kids meals that are healthy.  The Salmon Entree is delish!  For kids, the QuinoaCorn and Mashed potatoes are great although the quinoa corn is a bit sweet for me.  The wraps are great, my fave is the veggie and I add tofu to it.  Lemonades so good and use cane sugar.  Its the best!  Avoid going at the lunch rush bc there will be a long wait."

0,"bad hotel. It has seen better days. Casino is nasty. Food is horrible. Drinks are bad. nnI stayed here for  night and had to get a smoking room because they did not have any more non smoking rooms with  beds. I dont know how it happens but the bed linens reeked of cigerettes. I guess with all the smoking the odor gets absorbed into the mattresses. This does not have any of the glitz and glamour that you expect when you think of vegas. But I knew that before coming here and Ive stayed here a few times in the past, but for some reason this time it hit me that downtown vegas is a shithole. nnStay here if your real cheap and dont mind lousy casinos."
0,"I used to come here when they first opened and love the place but maybe Ive changed because this place just doesnt fit me any more.nnMy last beans did seem to have any brisket in it the last time I came and that was my favorite thing here always doubled up beans as my side.

0,"WOW I am really surprised by all of the good reviews of this place!  I have been here twice both times for lunch. The first time I went with colleagues and two of us ordered soup. It came out cold and had to be sent back. We ordered the cheese curds to share nothing great and I had the Chimi Chicken Torta which was actually pretty bland. nnThe second time I went, I ordered the Tomato and Bread salad with chicken. By the name of the salad, you would think it would have tomatoes on it right? I had two little pieces of a tomato, wilted greens, and a couple little tiny balls of mozzarella. Not acceptable. I asked the waitress for more tomatoes and mozzarella and after looking annoyed, she returned with more of each. nnI dont know what others are having thats so great, but I am very unimpressed with this place and will not be returning."

The even with a steep  price tag, the  year old sourdough starter pancakes caught my eye.  I added the bacon and two eggs scrambled.  . without tip.nnAfter the typical Toms Thumb wait the breakfast arrived.  I was a bit surprised.  My breakfast consisted of  six or seven inch pancakes, charred,  strips of bacon, and a mound of browned eggs.  Hoping the taste would justify the deficit in the servings appearance and portion, I dug in.  No...  The eggs were as they appeared, overcooked an rubbery.  The pancakes were ordinary and disappointing.  The bacon was however, well prepared.nnWill I go back?  Yes, but I will stick with the BBQ for lunch and dinner."
0,"Food was pretty decent but service left much to be desired. Came to celebrate my birthday with friends, had to practically beg our server to smile or pay attention to us. In the middle of selecting our appetizers he just walked away, didnt return for  minutes. Got water in the beginning, couldnt get a refill until he was clearing our plates, despite our efforts to get his attention. Sangria is tasty but cant imagine any of us will return."
0,"The wait to get your food was long even tho they were not all that busy. The inside is clean but the decor is nothing special. Just like the decor the food was nothing to rave over ether, it was like any other burger. All things said this is the one and only stop that I have made here so I may go again to try something other then they burgers to see if its better."
0,This place is sketch central. Out room was located in what seemed like a trailer park across the street from the main resort. It was so incredibly sketchy that it even had two signs with red font on the door saying Make sure the door is locked at all times. The whole place is just dirty and trashy. Add another  a night and stay at the Paris for a normal Vegas experience.
0,"Ive been in this store twice now. The first time was to buy a rocking chair for my nursery. We waited about  minutes for the one person working in the furniture area to assist us. It then took another  min for someone to bring up the item so we could leave. Taking  minutes to pick something out and then waiting another  to leave the building seems a bit ridiculous. Even checking out was delayed because of only one person working the checkout.nnToday, we waited about  min to try and purchase a chest of drawers. After waiting, we were informed that the item that said in stock was not in fact in stock.nIf I ever need to purchase anything from this store in the future, I will do it online. Apparently they do not hire enough staff to accommodate their customers."
0,"Cant believe we drive  miles for this place. What a joke! They only take cash or check, comeon in , pay the merchant fee and get a credit card machine. Then you have to separately order and pay for food and drink. Yes thats right, go stand in two different lines. No refills on soft drinks, horrible beer selection and the worst BBQ chicken pizza Ive had. I didnt know you could screw that up. We came, we tried, we wont be doing it again!"
0,"I had a terrible experience here. I dropped off a queensized comforter and two decorative pillow shams to be dry cleaned. ., which I thought was a bit pricey, but it was comparable when I called around, so there you have it. nnAlthough I was told they would be ready in two days, when I called four days later I was told to come the next day. Then, when I got the comforter back I had to go back a separate time for the shams which I thought had been folded into the comforter I was not told they werent there. nnAlthough the woman who helped me was courteous and kind, I just wasnt impressed at all with the service. I asked that they put the comforter back into the bag I gave them they didnt. The cheap bag they gave me fell apart when carrying it into the house. nnMaybe my experience was an anomaly, but thats it. Everyone else seems happy with them, so perhaps I need to give them another shot with my regular clothes."
0,"Eh, I love  hate you CR...nRight now, I hate you! Tryed your online ordering for the first time and probably the last time. When I got there I went to the pu line. You guys didnt even have my order online? Hmmm, lady at counter said it takes  minutes to come up after you order? Not cool but what ever. Ive been charged for it already so Ill wait. Tick  Tock   minutes pass, I get up and walk back over to the lady to see if it is up, it is. Woowho! So she said theyll start to make it. Alright, cool. Took  more minutes!? Oh come on now, I just got off work, all I want is my damn cheese enchiladas and my chips  guac!nI know you guys get extremely busy but there was no reason for my order to take that long! Geez"
0,"To say I was disappointed with Frida would be an understatement. nnWe went here to that we could hear Jazz in the Square while enjoying some sangria.  The sangria mostly just tasted like watered down franzia.  There was no fruit or anything in it at all.  nnAfter getting our pitcher of sangria, we thought we should order something even though we werent hungry just because we were taking the waitresses table for an unknown period of time.  We ordered some type of cheese appetizer that was so bland I cant remember anything about it besides that it was gross. nnThe service was quite friendly and they werent pushy trying to get us to leave so that is the only reason they are getting  stars instead of ."
0,Been coming since opening day but for some reason last weekend was almost terrible. The seating was terrible because my chair was place in a high traffic area so everyone that works there was bumping into me all night. Food is still great but the service is lacking. I had to asked for the lamb chops twice and they didnt serve it until I was there for hr mins. Some of the fillet minions were also dry. The dessert menu needs upgrading and whats distasteful is that the manager was too busy watching MMA at the bar instead of making sure the customers were satisfied.
0,"I really wanted to like Gallaghers after reading all the great reviews. I really did.nnUnfortunately, our dining experience was less than stellarn My husband was not served alcohol because he left his ID in our hotel room even though my yearoldplus parents vouched for his age hes . We hadnt been carded the entire trip. I get that they dont want to get in trouble, but this was annoying.n It took about  minutes after we sat down to get bread, and we received our entrees ONE HOUR after ordering. We ordered after PM on a Sunday night, and they were not swamped with customers.n One of my fellow table guests asked the breadwater server for an update on our food, and he said hed check with our server. Our server Linda consequently ignored us until our food arrived, about  minutes later. We tried to make eye contact with her to no avail while she was checking on other tables around us.n Several dishes were cold when we finally got them i.e. French fries, which are never good cold.n My husband found several hairs in his food about  minutes after we were served. We told our server. She came over and asked if he had saved the hairs for her to see. Who saves hairs they find in their food? Thats disgusting! Look on the floor where he tossed them!n The manager came by after our server told him about the hairs on my husbands plate. He too questioned my husband if he saved the hairs um, no. The manager said, Im surprised, this usually doesnt happen  I would certainly hope not!n Neither our server or the manager offered to get another meal for my husband again, after waiting an hour to get our food, so we were all hungry!. They took his hairy food off the bill, but such an accusatory attitude toward a guest is awful. They were both defensive and arrogant when it came to trying to make the situation better.nnOverall, I was extremely disappointed. To wait an hour for food, topped off with rude staff, is unacceptable when youre spending  per person on food and drinks. I work in customer service myself so I know how important it is to cater to your guests. The sad part is, its Vegas and they dont care if you ever come back, so they could care less about keeping their customers happy.nnI emailed Gallaghers customer service via their website, not New York New Yorks, so it will be interesting to see if I get a response back."
0,"I was very disappointed with my experience at Primp and Blow at the Waterfront.  My friends and I went here together to get our hair done for our work party.  The problems started when I sat around waiting for my appointment to start as my stylist socialized and styled her own hair before deciding to help me.  When she washed my hair the hot water was out in the salon so it was cold.  nnThe biggest issue was when she styled my hair.  I have curly and very thick hair.  I told her i wanted it straight, pretty basic.  She then asked if I wanted any curl to the ends instead of it just being straight.  I said that if she thought that would be better I was open to it.  When she finished the initial blow out my ends were more than a little curled and everything was going in different directions.  My left side flipped under while the right flipped out.  I told her I wasnt crazy about it and she immediately got defensive asking what i wanted, which I thought I had clearly explain when I arrived.  I told her that I didnt want everything going in different directions, so she tried to fix it.  It looked exactly the same after the second attempt.  When I said that I still wasnt a fan she told me that as a professional I needed to take her opinion on what looked good.  Her patronizing attitude was more than I could handle so I told her it was fine so that I could just get out of there and get on with my day.nnShe then proceeded to add additional product to my hair which topped everything off by making my hair greasy, something that is very difficult to do.  In the end I went home, washed my hair out and did a better job myself.  I wouldnt suggest wasting money if you are capable of a basic blow dry at home.  Save yourself the money, trip and attitude."
0,"Eh, not that great.  I definitely expected a lot more because of the location and price of the restaurant.  The service was not that great.  I actually had my bill slapped on my table as I was eating my lunch.  He expected me to pay too! but that wasnt really why I gave it  stars.  The food wasnt that good.  I tried the thai spicy noodles that costed me  bucks.  Ugh, just.. not that amazing.  Mediocre, poor service, and just bleh.  nnI really liked the interior design though!"
0,"The place is small and cute. We tried all the flavors and I got a small cup with a few toppings and thoroughly enjoyed it. I would go back if I had the craving for ice cream. It is a little pricey to me, but then again most ice cream places are now these days. It is missing something...just not sure what."
0,"Fox Rent A Car in many aspects that matter, is awful.  That transfer you make to another shuttle after riding your original shuttle to the airport car rental center is ridiculous.  I was told it was to avoid some sort of tax, but I think the difference between Fox and most other rental car companies was only a few dollars.  I would have gladly spent it if I had known.  I highly advise anyone reading this to make the additional investment.nnAfter the long, tedious, staggering line, when you finally make it to the person at the counter, they are so nice and helpful that it reminds you of the way customers SHOULD be treated.  I dealt with a few different people here for various reasons and they were all so helpful and accommodating once I finally got to them after waiting in line.nnGreat customer service, awful waiting time and airport shuttle transfer way too time consuming.nnWould I book with them again? No.  Do they have awesome customer service when you are finally able to deal with them?  Yes.  Fox Rent A Car just has too much working against it."

0,"Seemed like she cut too much of my cuticles on the side of my fingers.  It almost seemed like she wasnt being careful and was rushing.

This is a classic proof that we should always try out a place for ourselves before believing anything we read on any review sites."
0,"Went there for lunch today and had one of the worst experiences ever dining out.  I had ordered two lunch specials for me and a friend.  st, friend ends up cancelling, then the food comes and it really tastes bad.  The portions are very small and the food came just soaked in extra, extra sauce.  So I asked to take the other lunch home and put it in a to go container.  Then a patron couple decided not to eat  grabbed my food and ran out the restaurant.nOh shit right, no the store did not take it of my bill.  They proceeded to take my credit card and still charge me.   Bad food, bad area, and very bad service."
0,"Chipotle is so good that even when its not, its still better than most meals under . Why  stars? Well the employees here were loud, screaming over the music, and seemed annoyed to be working.

Awkward. nnI prefer the one in University City where employees smile and the food looks fresh."

0,"Meh....went there last Thursday for a late breakfastearly lunch.  other table in the place,  more came in while I was there. I ordered a veggie wrap without mushrooms, which according to the menu had green peppers on it. It arrived with roasted red peppers, which I cannot stand. I started to remove them and pointed this out to the server and she said that it came with a mix of green and red peppers. If so, it should say it on the menu. Maybe other dont find peppers so polarizing, but I do! I doublechecked the menu on my way out and I just think the it should reflect what you are actually getting OR if theyre out of an item, the server should tell you when you order  Also, fries were bland and undercooked. Just felt like the place lacked any attention to detail."
0,My wife and I recently ate at Bamboo  and were disappointed with our meal. We started off with the fried wontons that are given to every table. There was something off about the wontons both in flavor and texture. We mentioned our concerns to the waitress who laughed at us! Seriously wtf? We spoke to the owner a bit later and she gave us a fresh bowl but the problem remained. Strike . I ordered Szechuan Beef as my entree. I ordered it hot and spicy and it came out mild. Strike . Apparently the waitress didnt see any problem even when it was pointed out to her that no red peppers were present. My wifes meal and that of her friends were also bland and tasteless. What a shame. Weve been dining here since they opened.
0,"Bar none the worst!!!  I have been waiting months to write this review.  I need my daughters Bat Mitzvah to be over before sharing my awful experience with Living Energy.  If you thinking about hiring Living Energy for party planning, DJ services, or lighting, read this review first.nnI hired Toby to be my party planner.  She had a flat fee contract of , and she promised to not mark up the contracts that she negotiated on our behalf.  This sounded reasonable to me and I signed the contract.nnThe initial planning sessions went well.  We picked out a venue for the event and solidified a contract.  Then the pressure started to hire her DJ through Living Energy.  I went to  different Mitzvahs to watch their DJs and ALL the parties were flat and lame.  They tried to make excuses, but their DJs were terrible!!  Go see them before you hire them!!nnNot wanting to create an uncomfortable situation, we decided to hire a band  Sapphire Sky they are amazing!!.  nnAfter we had picked the venue and the band, now was time for the event extras.  These are things like lighting, duecor, a photo station, tattoo artist, airbrush artist, food items, video truck rental, etc.  This is where the real trouble started!!nnFirst, Toby gave me a RIDICULOUS contract for lighting through none other than Living Energy.  It was , more than I ended up spending and she put a heavy pressure on me to sign the contract.  Then came the contracts for the photo station and airbrush artist.  All were around , more than I ended up spending for her preferred vendors.  Then came the duecor package  another , more than I ended up spending.nnI sat down with her and told her that the total cost was not in my budget.  I looked at each item and asked simple questions like ...Why does an airbrush artist cost  and hour without supplies??  nnFinally, I went around her and called my the companies on my own, and found out that she was dramatically marking up the prices on EVERY ITEM!!!  I have no proof that she was getting a kickback from these companies, but I can tell you that I ended up with more services and saved over , from her original contracts.  Needless to say, as soon as I told her that I was not using Living Energy for the lighting or her other vendors, she fired me.nnMy question is this ... If Toby made her money from her , planning fee and did not mark up other contracts, why would she fire me for negotiating contracts on my own??  nnI strongly recommend that people planning their childs Bar or Bat Mitzvah spend a few minutes and check the sanity of the pricing that they get from Living Energy.  They are not honest and their DJ quality is lacking.nnI am happy to help anyone planning a with the vendors that I used.  Feel free to email me at zoneraichgmail.com for information."

You have to ask if they can upgrade you in casinos, the worst they say is no. My complaint about tropicana is well, I do not listen to directions beyond the first thing someone says. Hey, I am a guy. So, it took me about  hours to find my hotel room. The problem is no one cares to help you. I showed them my room number, and everything they still could not help me.

0,"I purchased one of the Groupons for Regal Cinema and tried to use it tonight. The Groupon was for two tickets, but the clerk only could redeem one  movie.   She went to get a manager.

I find it ridiculous that not even the manager knew how to redeem a Groupon for their product.  Also, she agreed that I HD paid for two and to make me battle it out with Groupon is annoying.  Whatever happened to making the customer happy?  Im also annoyed that the process took  minutes and wasnt even properly resolved.

0,"Let me explain first that I was bumped to this property for two nights by the Scottsdale Plaza . mile away, as the Plaza over booked their hotel by  rooms I was attending a  day event at the Plaza. Since this was the Plazas mistake, we were comped for the two nights. The front desk person was borderline rude and became ruder when we insisted on a suite since thats what we had booked at the Plaza. Then they put us in the back forty. If it was because they were booked I would of understood, but later heard that wasnt the case. At that point, I didnt want to be moved as I knew I would be moved again in two days back to the Plaza. The suite itself was a little claustrophobic with low ceilings. It was clean and maid service was prompt at just before noon. But some of the fixtures were older and a little worn especially in the cramped kitchenette. I can put up with those type of things, although rudeness by the front desk is unacceptable. I really cant recommend the Cottonwoods."

0,If I could cuss on here and not have my review erased by a moderator I would. This place is over priced. The famous bedazzled lollipops are defective and the refills dont fit.

0,"This place has been a Montreal classic and I was excited to try it. But I guess I was being an ignorant American and thought I could come for dinner on a Thursday around pm without a reservation. I was greeted at the entrance by a hostess that was less than happy that I did not speak French then looked as if I insulted her when I apologized I did not have reservation. Eventually our party was seated at the bar but we were told we would have to leave within . hrs. Ok, thats fine. I was actually happy to get a table at the bar which was right in front of the kitchen so we got to see everything being made, that was the best part of this experience. Server was also very nice as well and was not at all rude like the hostess. nnWe ordered some foie gras dishes, boudin, and a pied de cochon, the first few bites were delicious but as you continued, it tasted all very one note. Everything tasted like onions and butter, nothing wrong with that just hard to eat an entire plate of it. Although we didnt order it, the pigs head for two looked amazing an entire pigs head with two knives sticking out of it sitting on a bed of mashed potatoes and could probably feed  people. Was glad I came since it is such an institution, but would not want to come back."

It was barely  weeks and I went back for a fill I mentioned again they need to b thicker still didnt listen to me. Less the  weeks go by again and I went back because I had  nails that broke because again not thick enough I glued the nails.  Told him he needed to replace them which again he didnt listen he finished my nails I left and  hrs later one of the cracked nails broke I went back the next day Toon was not there someone else fixed my nails but did not replace it so less the a week later I have all  nails broke and glued again...

0,"My family and I attended Michael Jackson One and all left feeling very disappointed.  We are all advent MJ fans and huge Cirque du Soleil fans so we all entered the theater very excited.  Unfortunately this show did not live up to either Michael Jackson or Cirque du Soleils reputations.  It was very unpolished and seemed thrown together haphazardly.  There was no transitions between songs, the kids that got the special powers from Michaels iconic items were hokey and annoying, dancers were not all on time together, and the list goes on.  On top of that I counted at least  very noticeable errors and mistakes, more than I have seen in all the other Cirque shows combined!  Lights on dancers were out of sync and color and one poor guys lights never even turned on.  I appreciate their thought and willingness to experiment with lights and technology but from Cirque I expect flawlessness.   nnMy family and I have never walked out of a Cirque show with any other feelings besides awe, wonder, and feeling good.  This show we all walked out with mixed feelings.  There were definitely some highlights the trampolines, the hologram, guys in black and white suits, the slack line, thriller, the rope climber, and pole dancer.  But unfortunately we were all left feeling let down and like they could do so much more with this show.   nnCirque, youre better than this."

0,"After reading all the other reviews, I was excited to try out Georges with my husband. We normally go to Pita Shack in Tempe when we are looking for a good Gyro but we were on the north side of town and wanted to grab a quick dinner. Looked up some options on Yelp which is what led us to Georges. My husband ordered the Gyro with jalapeufos, onions and peppers and I ordered the traditional Gyro with a side salad. We also ordered some Spanakopita and  drinks. Honestly the best thing about the meal was the side greek salad. Gyro meat was cold... which was kind of a bummer as we waited just about  minutes for the two pitas to come out. What really irked me was after we had checked out and were waiting for our food, a group of guys walked in and the girl asked if it was their first time in and since it was, offered up complimentary drinks. It wasnt like they were busy when we came in, she was just very short and didnt feel like engaging with us. Maybe an off night for the staff and food, but I wouldnt be inclined to go back."
0,"Along with my husband and  other friends, we went to the Orange Sky for drinks.  I had dressed up very nicely for the occasion including my Ellen Tracy top, black pants and nice jewelry.  I also wore patent leather thong sandals.  Upon entering the ground floor by the elevators to the Orange Sky, I was told by the maitre d that I could not go up because I was wearing flip flops.  Meanwhile, others in tennis shoes and baggy jeans were allowed.  My friend said she had some old walking shoes in the car and we should get those.  So, I went out to the car and got the dirty old walking shoes and proceeded to put them on and head back.  No problem  admitted.  Now we get to the top and I see other women in silver thong sandals, beige thong sandals, etc.  nnWe had drinks and a couple of apps salmon cakes and the chili beef tips.  They didnt have much of a selection of apps and really no imported beer.  The apps we did get were expensive and nothing very special.nnThe sunset, however, was spectacular in spite of the dirty windows but to be fair, there had been a dust storm the day before.  nnOn the way down, I stopped by the maitre d again and told him I saw other women in thong sandals and he said that was not true and that he would not let anyone in with flip flops.  Im not sure if this guy had something against me or what but he certainly seemed to have missed the entire concept of the purpose of a dress code. nnI would not go back here in spite of the lovely sunset."
0,"How a place that was so slow, could be so bad is beyond me. Wow one of the worst. First of all, ordered wine and they brought the wrong kind. Next we received our order. The Salmon was raw, my steak was tough. When they took the fish back they just brought out the same fish, just put it back in the pan and made it like rubber. The Cook in the back, I say cook, because no way a proper Chief would have sent that food out, He saw I was trying to get someone to come over. He pointed to the MGR and he looked at me, the MGR took two steps, then turned around and found our waitress and made her walk over. This place is Awful. This is a MGT issue. One guy walked over at the end and asked me how things were. I said I had a list of things that went wrong. He said, He did not want to hear them all. OMG. Im checking out of the hotel tomorrow. Never to come back. Sorry Marriott, This place does not meet your standers."

0,"Horrible. Ive never argues with a stylist so much in my life. I came in and explain what I usually get done with my hair and I showed her pictures and everything but she fought with me every step of the way. I told her I wear my hair long and straight with side bangs and lots of layers. She told me that style is so s and she would show me how to wear it curly. I told her my hair is very thick and I at least needed it thinned and she again told me that volume looks better and its sexier. She cut two little snips off the bottom of my hair, rubbed some gel into it, and said I was done. This place is great if you are looking for a make over or to change up your style, but if you are looking for a salon to go to that will maintain your current hair and listen to you and take into account what you want then this is not the salon for you."
0,"DONT EVER LIVE HERE!! nnNote After I first posted this on the internet, I received a CEASE AND DESIST order from the lawyer representing the apartment complex. yikes.nn nI lived in this complex for nearly  years. It was at first owned by Grubb Properties, a company who cared for the residents and kept the property looking nice. I enjoyed living there then. It was later sold to a developer who literally only cares about receiving a rent check monthly and will do nothing to help anyone. It was rumored that the purpose of a development company buying the property was that they were kicking the residents out, tearing down the existing property, and planned to build nice, new high rises that would allow them to make more money. As the economy got worse, they were forced to keep the current property open and continue renting apartments. They rent to drunks, TEENAGERS, convicts, or anyone who can pay a months rent deposit. My property was damaged in the parking lot, my car was broken into and  of property was stolen, one of the drunken residents ASSAULTED MY DOG, and the property manager claimed it was no fault of theirs and refused to provided any kind of consession. My fiance actually broke his hand at the pool while trying to diffuse an altercation between two other residents and required , emergency reconstructive hand surgery this was the straw that broke the camels back, so to speak, and we moved out immediately after this event. I was paying month while I know for a fact that they were leasing to new renters at a rate of month. The building itself is deplorable. The staff not only dont care about any of these concerns, but one of the managers actually had a sexual relationship with a resident who was a constant cause of conflict, and was seen on multiple occasions using illegal drugs on the property. The property is dark and unsafe a haven for criminal activity. People make drug deals using the  only phone located in the pool area. Police are called out to the location on an almost daily basis. Residents stay up all night partying loudly at the pool, which is located in the courtyard between all of the apartments, leaving a huge mess to be cleaned up EVERY morning. I would prefer to live in a cardboard box on the street than ever live at these apartments again. Please do yourself a favor and avoid this place like the plague. Also, the laundry room has  washers and dryers for about  residents half of them are broken the majority of the time. There used to be a credit card machine in there to use to pay for washers and dryers, but they tore it out and now only accept quarters."
0,"Worst food it think I have ever eaten! Everything tasted like it was out of the microwave. I ordered the ribeye and it definitely wasnt ribeye. I asked for a manager and told him that the ribeye was a real bad piece of meat and he tells me..oh sorry about that... Thats how our ribeyes taste and thats what we get delivered to us. I know it doesnt taste like a ribeye, but thats what we serve people. HELLO! They need new management! What a joke this place is. I can say that the place has a great atmosphere, thats about it!"
0,"I have ordered  pizzas in a week in the halfs time. Two of them came very well done where the crust was pretty hard. They have no email address or a way of contacting by their web. All the pizzas I got were to go and I live  minutes away...not trying anything else there. The margarita pizza was good, but not when burned! nnThe pizzas were gooddecent. I expected a little more from the good reviews. I guess if u live close by and dont want the traditional Papa Johns, Pizza Hut, etc then you should try this place."
0,"I was a little disappointed. A lot of people told me this was the best steakhouse in Vegas. It wasnt, at least in my opinion. The food wasnt bad, but I was expecting more. The ribeye was OK and the sides were boring and bland. Also the atmosphere was off. I just didnt get the feel that I was in a high end steakhouse. One plus was the service. The wait staff was very good. With so many other outstanding steakhouses in Vegas I doubt Ill be returning to Del Friscos anytime soon."
0,"Being new to Las Vegas, I was excited to visit Westside Trains. I am an experienced model railroader, so maybe my expectations were too high. When I entered the store the person at the counter never even said a word to me. I guess customers are not that important. There was a lot of Lionel trains, but nothing really displayed very well. The HO products were few and basically for beginning modelers. Very few structure kits and certainly no craftsman kits. Equally lacking was any scratch building supplies other than a few plastistruct items. I always prefer to support local businesses, but it looks like I will have to go back to using online stores."
0,"Once again Park disappoints and screws up before I can even get a drink or food!  This is the rd time Ive tried this place and the third time Ive been treated like hell. This time a large  group of us who happen to work just down the street stopped in at . We were seated by the staff, seated by staff and were just about to order when a different  staff member came and told us rudely we had to move.  Of course we asked why.  These seats are reserved she said, although there was no reserved sign on the table AND WE DIDNT SEAT OURSELVES  THE HOSTESSWAITRESS DID! She demanded we move.  They offered us a table with  chairs  for  people?  The manager came over and said You should have made reservations. and my response was If you didnt have seats for us why on earth would you seat us? Why werent we told Im sorry, but we cant accommodate a large group   We happily left and took our business across the street to a bar where the staff actually seems to communicate with each other and want the business of actual, long time downtowners."
0,"We were a party of three with reservations for .  We were all disappointed with our food.  The shrimp and bacon were undercooked, and worst of all my lobster was spoiled.  The astatic were nice and the waiter was attentive.  However the food was the worst we ever had.  We actually give the food a minus five, we will never return, and will advises everyone we speak with never try this establishment.  Oh, by the way we could hear loud arguments in the kitchen.nnThey also miss our special occasion a birthday.  We paid for sht."
0,"My experience with this Johnny Rockets has been meh. there is usually ample seating, so getting a table never takes long. I come here a lot for several reasons unrelated to the quality of this establishment and despite coming at all sorts of different times, my experiences are consistently poor. It takes long time to get our food never ordering anything special often longer than  minutes. The quality of the food is ok maybe  stars and the waiters are also average  stars. But often the wait staff is inattentive to drink refills and other key things like order taking or checking in. So Im dropping them down to  stars. Also, as a side note, when I have onion rings substituted for fries at an additional charge they give me a pitifully small number of onion ringslike  medium sized ones."
0,"I will never stay here again, when we checked in the room we were very disappointed.  The beds are so small and they are super hard . We had no ice bucket,  not enough towels and the window was open ! That alone freak me out. We went bed pretty late. So in the morning at  am they were knocking, then I kind of woke up I heard the door open really ! Check out is until  pm. Why would you open the door when its locked with the bolt. So I look for a not disturb sign and we didnt have one. Had to call front desk to unlock safe also. I would not recommend this place. And it kind of dirty too. A lot of misery spots. Fan in bathroom doesnt work. Bring your own soap and shampoo"
0,"My friends and I went to the Wrigley Mansion for a luch and tour special yesterday.   We ordered our food and the first course was really good.  It was a spinach  bleu cheese salad.   The second course was Croque Madame.   It looked wonderful, but on my first taste I almost hurled!  I am not a picky eater at all, but the ham was completely rancid.  I spit it into my napkin and my  friends were shocked because I never send food back and Im the opposite of  a drama queen.  Thats why they were so shocked.  The waiter asked if I wanted anything else and I politely declined.   Id lost my appetite, of course.  My friends fish was almost raw, too.    So we decided to take the tour and have coffee  dessert afterwards.  The mansion was beautiful and the guide, Ashley,  was fabulous.  I was sad to see every single room was set up as a dining room.  There were no beds or dressers anywhere.  But the art, They have a Renoir , the chandeliers, the view and the grounds were stunning.  We went back to eat our creme brulees and our old watered down ice teas, waters and crumbs were still sitting there.  The waiter didnt freshen up anything while we were on the hour tour.  And there were only  other tables of  there!    So we got our desserts and coffee.   It was good so far.   Then I asked for a coffee refill and I put in my cream  sugar and took a sip and the coffee was cold!!  I was so surprised that it was so cold that I spit it in my creme brulee cup.  Again, Im not a drama queen.  This was just so bad.  We told the waiter the coffee was cold  he was so surprised.  DUH!  He was nice but so inept.   Well never go back, especially to eat!   I was the worst dining experience  that Ive had.   They should at least give everybody a pack of Juicy Fruit for the road.  Anyway, it was such a disappointment, and Ive wanted to go there since high school."
0,"So very nearly a  star  this place is . why cant yelp do halfstars like flixster?... the place is a conceptual hodgepodge priced for the superrich. I felt uncomfortable there  but a lot of that has to do with my occasional social anxieties. Still, Canal oozed pretentious asshole present company excluded. I cant even call it douche because douche cant afford this place on their waiter wages. nnEven if I had this kind of money, I wouldnt go here ever... its just not for me. I liked some of the concepts and the runway and curtains looked kinda neat... but then the exposed pipes on the ceiling looked like a cross between cool and gross as some of them appeared to be sewage lines  why would I want to have a meal with sewage lines running along the wall right next to my plate? nnThe menu was also this odd handmade confusion... everything about this place was oneoff. Even the appetizers had attitude  a simple bacon and cheese finger sandwich clearly aspired to be more. It was delicious, but cmon. I didnt drink anything  I simply had a diet coke. The server was very nice, but brought my coke out with a huge lemon slice on the rim which left seeds in my drink. Odd. Its relatively new though, Im sure the kinks will get ironed out over time. nnId like to see a fancypants place like this serve a turd pate  like plate up the shit they scoop out of shrimps and garnish with mint leaves  and charge  bucks for it... I bet people would eat it and pay for it. Bah. nnSarah and I wandered around the mixed shops and arrived at the end before realizing it was more than one store. They all sold the same crap  most of it was grossly overpriced. Again  this goes beyond douche  the clothes were more stylish and simple and much more expensive than douche can afford. To be honest, much of it was quite nice but still, if I had a billion dollars, Id feel like a fraud paying  bucks for a casual jacket or  bucks for a tshirt. Wasteful. nnI am surprised that this sort of thing has permeated this far south  I thought it was a North Scottsdale thing. Im discouraged because I dont like the crowd this sort of place will attract, but at the same time I like what itll do to my property value. The reputation Scottsdale has really bums me out because I live here and I love it here. There are so many places to go where you dont have to encounter the doucheness. Its just becoming increasingly more difficult to convince antiScottsdale people to come. Eventually everyone here will be bobbleheaded plastic robots with too much money and no taste... Ill be consumed or assimilated or destroyed.nnI do have a feeling that the bottom will fall out and this mansion of cards will crumble to the ground  Scottsdale is living beyond its means. Or perhaps if you build it, they will come is the thinking. This is a strange time indeed. nnIt was my first Yelp event and I realize Sarah and I were antisocial  I attribute much of it to the setting... which was unsettling."
0,Had a taste for wings. . Googled this place the web said it closed at p.m. .. we get there at  p.m. the lady in the front tells us she cant serve us because they are closing an hour early because business is slow..  kinda disappointing but thanks anyway
0,"Not what I expected from this caliber of establishment. The service sucked. I requested items on several occasions,  received none. I ordered the shrimp  scallop dish. Shrimp was overcooked and scallops were raw. They told me to scoot my scallops onto another plate to refire. Totally not right. Brought them back still under cooked. Really? Then they put on super spicy chilis onto the plate. I almost burnt my mouth off. Dont go there. You can do better!"
0,"I visited with  friendcoworker, a rd party coworker, and a friend from the area. We shared an order of dumplings which were tasty. My friend loved them, but I was disappointed because they were fried and I expected steamed which I like better.  We also shared an order of crab dip which was mediocre, and there wasnt enough pitas for the dip, which always seems to be the case.  We ordered Seafood Bayou  which was Blackened Tilapia  Shrimp over Tavern Rice with Cajun Alfredo, Tomatoes,nScallions  One Side.  My friend loved it, I just thought it was edible.  The fish didnt taste fresh, so Im sure its just frozen, and the blackened seasoning tasted more like jerk to me. The rice tasted like one of those rice mixes you get at the grocery store.  The rd party got a quesadilla which was rare for her because all she eats is burgers and fries, she seemed to enjoy it.  I would try it again, but not for seafood, maybe for wings or one of the salads."
0,"I had never been to a Wing Stop before, decided to give it a try.  The taste wasnt too bad and there were enough flavor choices, but the food here is way too salty.  Probably will dine elsewhere when looking for wings next time."
0,"Not sure how the food is here. It could be wonderful, but we left due to a shocking lack of glutenfree items on the menu. We were told that only the steak tacos and a few salads were safe due to the marinades they used. There are a lot of us out here with food allergies...time to step up the game!"
0,"They no longer have the Monahan Meatloaf. The new version is good, but not the same. The clam chowder recipe is also diferent, and not as good. The shepards pie is awful. It is just potatoes and a lot of ground beef. It has little flavor. I like a shepards pie with some root veggies showing, and some taste. If you just like a lot of ground beef and mashed potatoes, this is the dish for you. I would never order it again. I think the place has gone down hill. Too bad they had to ruin their menu. It is also over priced."
0,"The food was good, but we got there at pm. At first the lighting was perfect. I could see the face of my date, or potentially the food that was placed in front of me we hadnt ordered yet. Then, BINGO, the lights were turned off and I was in a DARK, dark cave. Too much mood lighting for my taste. It made me want to lay down and go to bed. More importantly, it left me wondering what my food even looked like. Presentation of the food and overall ascetics adds to experience. Dont take this away with dark lighting.nnNow to the food, nnGorgonzola Salad, Bibb Lettuce, Pickled Onions, Crispy Prosciutto   good overall. Tad too much cheese. All I tasted was gorgonzola. There was also something sweet on the plate that tasted like dates... BUT I couldnt see for the life of me what it was thanks to the lighting.nnBacon Wrapped Dates, Blue Cheese Fondue  okay, the dates were too sweet, but the blue cheese fondue attempted to offset thatnnChorizo, Italian, Andouille Sausage Flatbread  it was okay. I wish I went with the chicken pestonnOnion Soup, Puff Pastry, Gruyuere Cheese  it was okay.nnAngus Mini Burgers, Mushroom, Chipotle Mayo  good dish"
0,Food lacked flavor. I did go there for a late dinner since I wanted something light and quick before heading out to the club. Ordered the Caesar salad with chicken but it was tasteless. The dressing was nothing special and the chicken seemed like the chicken McDonalds would put in their salads. My sister had the breakfast burrito which I did have a bite of and that was probably the most decent thing on the menu. The French dip is not good at all so dont bother ordering it. Many better places in the hotel to eat at.
0,"So, I ate here last night as part of the Madison Fair Share fundraiser dinner and my group was very excited. We paid  for our tickets which included  courses  each paired with a beer from One Barrel Brewing. What could be better than a menu that is hand crafted from local ingredients that were grown and brewed around Madison, right? Well, unfortunately for us it was a huge disappointment. nnWe had an appetizer that consisted of shredded cucumber, a rich buttery sauce, and nice pieces of bread. Very delicious and refreshing.nnThe first course was braised rabbit served on a bed of RPs fettuccine with a creamy mushroom and beer sauce. This was really delicious, especially whatever crispy things they put on top. The only complaint is that it was, at best, lukewarm when we received it. The beer was very delicious  an American Pale Ale.nnThe second course was where things went wrong. Strangely enough, they served us salad after the main course. It consisted of a pile of pickled vegetables, including pickled morel mushrooms, rhubarb, radish, and asparagus. It was served on a bed of greens with an ipa vinaigrette. Now, I was very excited about this dish at first  I LOVE pickled stuff. I thought the idea of pickled morels was very exciting and interesting. Unfortunately, everything about the dish was absolutely overwhelming and rather cringe worthy. The vinaigrette mixed with the pickling brine made our eyes water, the anise was confusing and disgusting admittedly, this may be a personal preference, but we all disliked it, and the greens were overshadowed by all of this. I wish this had been A. served before the main dish, B. had fewer pickles OR a less intense vinaigrette, and C. had more greens to even it all out. The beer with this one was also a loser for us  but we dont like IPA, so that is hard to gauge. nnThe third and final course was a dessert consisting of a strawberry and rhubarb sauce, a keylime curd, and a rather odd white puffy thing resembling a cham tort. None of us finished it. It was insanely sweet, the white puffy thing was kind of gross, and it was just not satisfying. The beer served with this was really rather ghastly as well  it was a wheat beer and it seriously tasted like cigarette ash. We each managed to take  or  sips to try and figure out what it was we were tasting, but after that couldnt take another drink. I would rather drink budweiser or old milwaukee, which is just about the worst insult I can give to a beer.nnFinal comments I had a really delicious old fashioned brandy, sweet, and the service was really great. The wait staff were really on top of things, and the owner was out there busting his butt, too. I will consider going back for their regular food some day, I just hope this poorly executed menu was a fluke rather than the norm. In the end, it helped support a group I think is doing really great things and I am happy I did it, I just wish it had been a little better."
0,"I reserved a rental through Hotwire for a fullsize car. When I arrived late at night to pick up my vehicle, the rental agent advised me they didnt have any more fullsized vehicles and that theyd give me a free upgrade. I am not picky, but the only vehicles she said they had were a minivan and an extralarge SUV. I knew Id be driving a lot and I didnt want to have to pay lots of money to gas up the vehicle, so I asked if there was anything else available. Instead of offering me something smaller, she said, sorry, this is all thats left on the lot. nHaving worked in the rental business I knew she wasnt telling the truth. Sure enough, I stepped outside and saw several other vehicles she could have put me in, like a Crossover or a miniSUV. They had dozens available on their lot, but I am not sure if she just wasnt creative or if she was lazy, but there were other things she could have done to accommodate me. The vehicle was nice and in good shape, and she wasnt rude, but I expect a lot more in the way of customer service. Rent from somebody else if you have the choice."
0,"Visited for the first and last time yesterday. Arrived and sat at the bar only to wait no exaggeration  minutes to be acknowledged. I felt like my friend and I were in a bad movie. Whadaya want said the  foot muscleman behind the bar. One Dos Equis and one bud light were ordered. I asked the bartender what he recommended for lunch and the following just amazed me Its all good dude as he finished his conversation with a fellow employee about how he cant get enough hours. Gee I wonder why?. Anyway, after ordering a pastrami sandwich which came quickly we began to feel the pain of our decision to drop in. The bread was hard and the meat was dry. The bartender didnt provide us with silverware or plates. I thought maybe he was trying to piss me off... I dunno. Finally another waitress checked on us and set us up. Mind you, I know it was  Sunday football right? but the bar area wasnt busy...now I know why. Service sucks!!! I spoke with Todd Manger the assistant gen manager. Said he would take sandwich off the bill but felt like he just wanted to get rid of me.... which was fine. SO... . for  draft beers that I could have had down the street at a dive for  bucks with more personality. Dont go here. Youll be sorry"
0,"The worst thing about coming to Fort Mill is this McDonalds.  First, it looks like it was built out of spare parts from a torn down warehouse.  Ive never seen a McDonalds with white vinyl siding, but theres a first time for everything.nnThe service is awful.  One time I went through the drive thru for a cup of coffee and they somehow managed to screw that up.  You might ask how do you mess up a cup of coffee?  The answer is to put five sugars in it instead of three, even though I didnt ask for that many.  I dont care if you think it tastes better that way which is what she told me when I questioned her on it.  Thats not how I ordered it.nnI gave them an extra star because of how terrible their customers must be their employees.  They probably get yelled at all day by angry people and its remarkable that they still choose to come to work."
0,"Let me say first that if I could give a lower rating to the way the staff of the Childrens Museum of Phoenix treated me,  a  or lower would be appropriate.  Unfortunately, I am limited in this respect.nnI believe it is appropriate to let a person know that you cant be someplace where you are expected.  In my place I got to where I was expected but wasnt allowed to stay.  Just the same I thought it was appropriate to let the person expecting to me to be there.  It does make a difference if where you are makes it very clear that they will make no more than the most minimal effort to help you do that.  That is a how the Childrens Museum of Phoenix staff handled my situation.nnObviously I was mistaken when I thought I could pay cash for tickets to the event that Yelpers were invited to at this place tonight.  I discovered when I got there that you HAD to buy your tickets on line ahead of time or else you were out of luck.  My mistake was to think the staff of this place might help me to let somebody from Yelp know that I at least got there if I couldnt stay.  Talk about a group of people that were absolutely unwilling to do more than than the minimum expected of them.  I asked them if they could bring up a Yelp page on a computer so I could explain to someone what had happened.  They were going do nothing of the kind.  The look of shock that I asked was apparent on the faces of a  couple of them!  Based on what happened and their attitude toward me, I told them I wouldnt be back.   One of the women said, Im sorry.  I told her she would only need to have said that if shed been willing to at least bring up a Yelp page for me and left.   Truthfully, It takes a lot to get me to say I wont go back to a place.  In this case... nnYou might say they were terribly busy and just didnt have time for the simplest of mistakes.  There were enough of them standing around that I was taken from one group to another.  It kind of reminded me of a department store where you walk in and the sales associates are standing around talking rather taking care of customers.  If these people were busy, Id hate to see them when they werent...maybe in a coma?"
0,Not so sure what the fuss was about but I was asked to go pick up something here and really got BLAH service from the young man who really could not answer my questions. I did not eat the stuff but the person I picked it up for was disappointed that it was frozen  not fresh and dry.
0,"Ive had a number of frustrating shopping experiences at this location. The store layout is quite different than other stores and items are not organized in any sort of logical manner.   Granted, this store is smaller than others, but Ive nevertheless left without the item I came in for. nnOn a positive note this location sells dry ice in block form, which Ive purchased a number of times and have been satisfied with."
0,I travel to CLT fairly regular on business. Went here with some coworkers and was disapponted. Waitstaff was not helpful with the menu. The food was mediocre at best. Had the paneer appetizer and it tasted like they were trying to make a McNugget with cheese. Sauces were tasty but now I wonder if they came from a can. If you really want great Indian food... Go to Copper. If you want McIndian go for it.
0,"My first visit to this eye doctor was excellent.  I received an eye exam and purchased contact lenses.  I was happy to have found a quality optometrist office close to my home.  However, after my second visit, I doubt I will return again due to a very unpleasant experience.  Before arriving I called the office to see if I could be accommodated, and the very nice receptionist said absolutely just to come in anytime.  I was attempting to get glass lenses for a pair of frames I purchased elsewhere.  The lady I didnt get het name but she is the middleaged, slender, brunette who assisted me when I came in was snarky, monotone without any hint of helpfulness, and had an attitude of superiority.

It just sprays out syrup or comes out like a water fountain completely flat. When I tell them about the issue someone goes and fixes it only to find nothing has changed. How they charge me for a drink when their machine is clearly broken... I do not know."

0,"Buyer beware. Total rip off. Poor service, sub par food. And a surprise bill!nnI have never taken the time out write a bad review, but this place was so bad I had to.

I rented the hall and had the food catered by the restaurant.nAll payments were agreed prior to the event and I left a sizable deposit.nnThe day of the event they increased the amount and asked if I could pay cash.nAt the end of the night they increased the amount even more and then said they would charge the taxes.  As angry as I was. I just paid them so I could get the hell out of there. nnMeanwhile the food was sub par by far.nI later found out  of my guest complained of suffering from gastro.nnThe service was rude and slow.nnThey kicked us out at am when they previously said we could stay till am. nnAll in all a very bad time had by all. nI will never go back there!!"
0,"Delicious food. Especially the fries but terrible service. Ruined the birthday dinner we went there for. Took forever to get extra plates, drinks, food, everything! Dont remember the last time ive had such poor service. Such a disappointment. Either they need new mgmt or mgmt needs to do something"

0,"I stayed here for three nights early in August for a conference. For the low, conference, weekday rate that I didnt have to pay for I would say that it was a decent value. That being said, I would not recommend this place for conferences, as the entrance to the conference area is the same path as the entrance to the pool area. The conference area bathrooms also share bathrooms that are placed near the pool, spa and gym entrance.nnAs for the rooms, not too bad, as long as youre not expecting WiFi. The fact that the place uses an ethernet cable symbolizes how outdated the hotel is. On the one hand, its nice because it means the internet is not slowed down by peoples phones constantly downloading stupid crap. On the other hand, how many people are using devices that even have an ethernet port anymore?nnThe Luxor is poorly lit, and it seems theres at least one flickering light fixture on each floor reminiscent of a horror movie. The pool is terrible too shallow, broken up into small sections as well. They constantly run out of pool chairs perhaps it helps them rent the mountain of premium chairs they cordon off. What irked me the most was that the last morning I was there the water coming out of the faucet and shower had so much sediment or something that it was literally brown. When I called the front desk they acted like it was no big deal, told me to just let it run, and explained that it resulted from a water outage earlier. Right..."
0,"I have dined at the elbow room twice now. First time I ordered a grilled cheese sandwich, and believe it or not, it was the worst grilled cheese I have had. I know what you are thinking......how can you mess up grilled cheese? I am still asking myself that question. I gave it another try last night because I did like the decor and the service was good. I thought maybe the cook was having a bad night. I had the Norman Rockwell burger and although it wasnt prepared as rare as I prefer, it was tasty. I was beginning to change my mind about this place until I decided to use the restroom.  Walking into this place, you would never imagine that the bathroom would be filthy. The decor is nice, the service is great, the food is average, and the bathroom is undescribable."
0,"We were walking around the Rio and decided we were a little parched. The bf, his family and I sat at the bar to order a few drinks and play a little video poker. It was around  at night so it wasnt too busy. THREE bartenders walked by us and not even a hello!!! Andrea older blonde lady finally offered to get us some drinks. She looked a little flustered and said it had been a crazy day for her. Even though she had a bad day, she was still pleasant with us and didnt seem annoyed that we only ordered drinks. Thanks Andrea for being pleasant enough for us not to walk out!"

It would have been nice to felt welcome not like a bother."
0,"Ambiance  starsnnI would not come here for the food ever again! I remembered biting into a tempura veggie mix and it had the undercooked taste.  Sushi was very mediocre.  nnAwesome, eye candy scene Cougars galore but the quality of the food just was not up to par with the rest of the sushiJapanese community.  And of course, way over priced!"
0,"Clearly I ordered the wrong thing judging from the other reviews.  nnI had the Chicken sandwich and fries.  The best part was the bread, which was delicious.  Fries were cold and soft.

0,"While the place is nice looking and the service is ok, the produce buyer should be fired.  The past  times I have eaten there, and have ordered the same salad, the greens have been on the rotten side, this includes the cherry tomatoes and cucumbers.  I am not returning for a fifth time."
0,"Weve had Chipotle catered once or twice where I work for store meetings.  Thats definitely the way to go as they are skimpy with their portions if you actually go there.nnThe menu is limited and, yes, I know all about their food with integrity which comes with a hefty price tag.  The salsa and chips are a joke as the salsa is in such a small plastic container reminiscent to what youd expect butter to be served in with a togo meal with a baked potato."
0,"How this place stays open, I have no clue at all.  The only redeeming quality is the service.  The food is terrible.  The drinks are nothing special, but are priced as if they are made with gold.  The layout of the dining room is awful.  The management team is clueless, or so it seemed.  The music doesnt fit the decor.nnIt is almost like a  year old girl got to create a restaurant and filled it with crap she likes instead of trying to generate an experience or ambiance for the guests.  In fact, that may be the problem in itself.  The guests seem to be thought of as single use bystanders in this place.  The only single use they seemed to have for me was a debit card at the end of the ordeal.nnEnd of story, place is a flop.  Go to CVS, buy candy, and save your money and eat somewhere else at Paris!"
0,"After the truth on the calorie count of the cookies have come out I have to update my review which I first did in October of .  Wow, I had been getting duped for a long time.

But I cannot support a business that has been lying to their customers since as far back as .

0,"I go to Vegas every year for my anniversary and have tried most of the casinos on the strip. I wanted to like it, I love the theme resorts. But service was pretty rude from beginning to end. nnWe paid for a red room luxury booking, when we checked in they didnt have any available.  When we asked why it wasnt reserved, the concierge rolled her eyes and lectured us on how shes doing her best to accommodate us. Um, that doesnt explain the lack of reservation at all, but great deflection and attempt to make us out to be the problem. At the very least I would expect an apology for not having it, instead of acting like were unreasonable for expecting our reservation to be reserved. They offered us a downgraded room. When I objected, she said she did have a red room luxury available, but only a smoking room and we booked a nonsmoking. I didnt want to get less than what we booked and paid for so I took the smoking room. Her explanation, after trying to get us to take a lower room, was that the smoking vs. non aspect of the reservation isnt guaranteed, only the room type. She didnt even offer us our room type though until I said no to the downgrade and asked for something else.nnShe also said the room was ready according to the maid service, but when we went up to our room the cleaning staff were still working on it. We had to hang out awkwardly while they were still mopping the bathroom. There were no snacks or drinks stocked though the fridge was wired up for that, and no robes. I wonder if maybe these things were missing because the maid felt hussled out of there by our presence or if these things just arent included anymore. These are standard niceties that Ive had at all my other casino stays even in the lowest room types, so it just felt shabby booking a more expensive nicerlevel room and not having any of these things. I think in the future I would recommend only booking the cheapest room type so that they cant possibly downgrade you if they dont have your reservation available."
0,"I want to love this place, I really do, but something is always not quite right.  First of all the amount of food that you get is almost scary.  Its enough for a few meals...theres no need to consume that much.  My second complaint is the wait.  Every time I come here for lunch, it seems like I spend my whole lunch hour waiting for the food...Which is never really that great.nnI guess theyre known for their breakfasts, maybe Ill fast for a week and then go there for breakfast and gorge myself on those ridiculous portions!"
0,"I called to ahead to make sure the location I visited  E. Flamingo would accept the coupon listed on their website for Smog Check service of . regularly priced .. The attendant on the phone said yes the coupon shown on my mobile device would be fine and there was no need to print it out. When I arrived, the attendant was dismissive at best, not offering a greeting or how can I help you?. Instead, he performed the smog check in silence and was unfriendly and curt in his responses when asked direct questions. When it came time to pay, he said that will be .. I said, Im sorry, I have the coupon on my phone which you thought would be fine when I called a few minutes ago. Without apologizing or showing any sign of remorse, pointed to a letter sized notice in the garage stating coupons must be presented before the test is completed. He did not mention this policy on the phone when asked if he would accept the coupon. I apologized again and explained that I was the one who had just called. He said how am I supposed to know if youre the guy when people are coming in and out all the time when I arrived, I was the only person at the business. I told him I would like to take my business elsewhere, and he said he would call the DMV to report a nonpayment. I told him I was disappointed in the way he was running his business would be calling the DMV to file a complaint. The attendant refused to give his name when asked. It just felt deceitful to his customers, and Im sure Im not the only one caught by the must present coupon before service. At the end of the day, its a difference of ., so it isnt a make or break deal, but it just makes you feel bad about the quality of business this establishment provides to customers. And honestly...if he would have charged me ., I would have given him a twenty dollar bill and said keep the change. Instead I paid  and waited for him to give me the penny in change that was due. His loss. nnId like to add the largest visible sign states No customers allowed in garage bay due to insurance reasons. The must present coupon before service is posted in the garage bay, and therefore not visible by customers.nnAlthough Id love to see Smog Busters turn this complaint into a customer service recovery by going above and beyond and refunding my entire purchase, I really dont have faith in the business at all. The local DMV has been notified and is following up. I would hope other customers take heed of the F rating the BBB has issued at the time of this complaint, and to take their business elsewhere. Preferably somewhere that treats their customers with respect."
0,"One of the worst meals I have ever eaten.  I was well aware of the history of Raos and was super excited to try this famous food.  The prices were very steep, for lunch and splitting our meal my mom and I still spent  each.  The salad was boring and bland, the main course of meatballs and spaghetti was so incredibly boring.  I hated every bite.  We actually were so hungry after this meal we had to run to somewhere else to get another lunch.  Total ripoff and you can find better italian food pretty much anywhere else.  Really, really disappointing."
0,"Firsty, DONT be fooled by the name because its not a traditional farmers market. Just another grocery store that gets a lot of their produce from MEXICO. The prices are way too high, especially their sprouts brand and it really isnt quality, nor does it taste good.

0,"I am rating My Sisters Closet based on a recent consignment deal. A couple of months back I signed over a Paper Boy by G button front plaid shirt, a tangerine pencil skirt by The Addison Story, and a beautiful  cashmere oversized sweater. Considering the quality and condition of these items, I trusted My Sisters Closet to price these items fairly.nnFast forward two months. I called today as I now live out of state to if my items sold and how much money I would be receiving. The saleswoman first told me both the Paper Boy shirt and cashmere sweater had sold, then proceeded to tell me I would only be getting a little over  for both items.nnHold on. My Sisters Closet gives you either  cash or  trade for each item sold. So, on average, they sold a nearly new cashmere sweater and a  shirt for roughly .. The shirt is more understandable at that price, but  is FAR too low of a price for a cashmere sweater that is less than a year old and in near perfect condition. I thought consignment was the way to go when selling pieces such as these, but apparently I was wrong. nnTo those thinking about handing things over to My Sisters Closet for sale, make sure to assess all other options before going this route."

0,"Located in what feels like the hood with gangbanger type cars going back and forth on the road to the east.  Gates are locked, so if your ball goes over youre screwed.

0,"The Skinny with the two signature items being only soso, this joint is a nogo ., service counter service was efficient however the lack of accessibility of items such as ketchup at a fast food joint was annoying. value certainly the food is better quality than other generic fast food joints however that doesnt mean that its worth the trip ..nnI really wanted to love this place  fried chicken and beignets... whats there not to love?nnOh dear...nnWe ordered a plate of chicken tenders with fries, a chicken sandwich and a beignets  making sure to test all their signature items. Counter service was quick we were the only customers at  pm on a weekday afternoon  food took less than  minutes and the food arrived to the table piping hot. Portion sizes for most things were very reasonable given the price.nnThe fried chicken tenders were singularily disappointing. . Uneven battering and cutting of the chicken rendered some parts moist while other parts very dry check the pics. Overall, the meat was cut too thick which definitely overwhelmed what little batter there was. The poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying.nnThe chicken in the chicken sandwich fared better because the cut of the meat was a little thinner .. However, enveloped in a rather generic large bun which wasnt a brioche bun as advertised  its more of a sweet roll with no sauces or accompaniments ie, lettuce, tomato, mayo, it was like biting into the Sahara. We ended up disposing of the bun altogether which made for a much better tasting experience.nnSauces were a major issue. We were served these two chicken items plus a large serving of fries with  small packets of ketchup,  small packets of bbq sauce some sorta generic stuff and  large packet of Newmans Own Honey Mustard sauce. You had to ask the lady behind the counter for any additional ketchup which was very annoying she gave me only  more small packets of ketchup... I regularly uses at least six of those bad boys for a small serving of fries. nnBeignets are supposed to be lovely and crisp on the inside while light and airy on the inside. The bennies here are like a deep fried large pocket of air almost like a pita pocket with little to no crispness. nnDespite all these issues, their standout item is definitely their gfries. Their fries were perfectly golden and crisp on the outside with the right amount of softness on the inside. The flavouring of the garlic, parsley, salt and pepper was fantastic. If only their chicken and bennys were this good...nnOverall, given the food, the hard to find location and the price point, there really isnt much to come back here for especially since there are other places that does it better."
0,"The idea behind the restaurant is very clever and it was a fun atmosphere but that is where the good review ends. Burger is mediocre at best just super greasy. The fries are alright.

I told the host that I just wanted to order something to go, but apparently u have to be seated down and wait for the waiter to tell him that I wanted to gowtf?

It took forever T.T  about  minutes later someone asked what we gonna order with a poker face...I told them I was ready to order everything to go but he said he can only take the drink order, so I ordered a Fiji bottled water and he just left, I had to wait  additional minutes just to flag down a waiter after being constantly ignored by whoever saw me bus person?, when they finally flagged down someone to take my good order, it was the same guy who took my drink n said he didnt take food orders. What? The whole process took more than  mins, the food was just mediocre but the price was on the upper side, now I would imagine a place with this price point in this fancy hotel would have a decent servicennBottom line, If u just came back to the hotel after clubbing with a group of friends and didnt mind waiting for food while u sober up or kept drinking, this place is okaynnBut if u want a quick meal, I would suggest room service instead!nnn."

He recommended two crowns and before you knew it I was out  after insurance! At least he gave me some pain pills.nnA month later I get the same pain, sharp pains molars, I go back for an emergency visit, and the dentist says I cracked the third tooth behind it which may have got infected? I said that was probably his fault when he removed the first two teeth and he proceeds to tell me I need a root canal and third crown. Luckily the root canal was successful and I return to get the permanent crown with more pain pills. He nicely said hed only make me pay half of the third crown to keep my as his customer.nnIts been six months, I have three crowns, a root canal and the pain has returned. My tooth is now super sensitive to cold to the point where even brushing my teeth hurts. I will not be returning to this office and have moved my primary care elsewhere. Its too bad because my schedules where on time and his location is great. I say in person Dr. Dunn is really nice, but Im flat out broke from spending money on my teeth and I cannot afford another one of his mistakes."
0,"I have gone twice both for lunch, the restaurant is charming but anyone can make  trendy country decor. The food is hit and miss. They need to figure out what is working and what is not, there is no consistency. nnFirst time we ordered the chips and dip, was a hit and had unique texture and taste. The apple chicken sandwich was falling apart and light but nothing to write home about. The bruschetta was blah.nnSecond time was a birthday celebration and two havent been there before. I fore warned not to get their hopes up. Two ordered the mushroom burger, cashier didnt ask the temp, so it came our well done. Looked like a flat dry piece of meat. Then the strawberry chicken salad on field greens was disappointing due to the chicken being over cooked and so dry we had trouble cutting it let alone swallowing it.nnI ordered the margarita pizza to play it safe this time. It was flavorful and good. With the overall experience its not worth the wait, time, or money. I might try it again in a few months after they work some kinks out!"
0,"We stayed at the Excalibur last week, thinking it would be fun for our  year old.  He was excited, thinking that we were staying in a castle. The hotel and rooms were decent and it had some good restaurants, but the idea that it is a family friendly hotel fell short.  The pool closed at  pm the water slide at pm.  What a better way to spend family time but in the pool, and a little later when the sun isnt blazing down. The pool hours really need to be extended.  You should also be able to use the jacuzzis in the evening.  We were also disappointed on the game floor dungeon.  It didnt open until  am, and even then, none of the carnival games were attended. The only option was video games. My son was really disappointed, as we planned to spend some time there before heading home on our last day.  It was also extremely annoying to be stopped  or  times anytime you walked through the hotel, by the people trying to sell you dinner packages and other entertainment tickets.  They dont take no for an answer. It was not a pleasant experience and this actually made it kind of stressful to walk through the hotel. Also, my son was injured on one of the doors going into the hotel.  His toe got stuck under the bottom, and it sliced his toe. It was gushing blood and he was screaming.  There were several hotel employees standing nearby and no one offered any sort of assistance."
0,"Service was slow, took  min to get water, lemon in water was slimy. The Salmon Tempura was greasy, the zuchinni tempuraa was greasy and too long, should have been better presented. The ceasar Salad was NOT a real Ceasar salad, Salad was wilted, and way too peppery. Waitress only came to fill our water after our meal was complete. We were going to order the Brazillian experiance meat carved  table but after watching waitstaff wonder inout of perimeters of tables into walking paths of shoppers in Planet Holleywood where this restuarant is, we passed. We have eaten at the Brazillian grille in henderson and found it amazing. Music, food, clean, etc.. Went home after this meal very ill, and will never eat there again.

0,Had dinner here last Saturday night.  We were seated right away. Food was decent.... service sucked. Couldnt get refils on our drinks. Mixed drinks also suck btw. Id like a little alcohol in them if Im paying  a drink. Our waiter was never around so we kept asking other servers to help us.  Instead of waiting on tables they seemed to all gather at the end of the bar for story time. Some sort of uniform should be required. If you are marketing yourself as a upscale Sushi restaurant your servers shouldnt be wearing ripped tshirts and polos with the number  on the back.  I wont be back. I can drive mins down the road to Kona Grill and get great sushi and great service.
0,Coworker and I went for lunch.  Absolutely packed and the food was just ok.  My hotdog was like something you would get at him.  Regular bun and dry with a cheap weiner in it.    My buddy got the gyro.  Again nothing to write home about.  I got a great dog off the cart off the street that was cheaper that this place.
0,"If this is the best that McCarran can offer, then yikes.  I trekked down here because it has one of the highest Yelp reviews. nn I got the Vegetarian sandwich, and as another yelper mentioned, it comes with both pesto and guac, which is weird, so I asked for just pesto.  The veggies have been soaking in some kind of marinade, which makes the bread a little soggy, and also makes the veggies feel a little slimy.  The guy personalized my sandwich with less cheese, though, which was nice.nnI asked if they could toast the flatbread, and was told no.  I asked if any sandwiches could be toasted, and the guy behind the counter said they were all cold.  nnI said the sandwich was for here, but was served the sandwich in a togo bag.  nnWhile I was sitting at the table eating my sandwich on top of the paper bag, another guy came in and ordered the vegetarian sandwich from a different worker, while the guy who made my sandwich was standing by.

0,"Ive been using this location on Val Vista to wash my vehicles since it opened but the last several washes were definitely subpar. It culminated with what I perceive to have been a total waste of my money yesterday when I had my Subaru WRX washed.nnI arrived at the wash at about  to have the Subaru cleaned and waxed. I had a coupon so I paid . instead of the normal .. The expectation was that I would get a wash, wax, mats shampooed and interior detailed. The car hadnt been cleaned in some time three weeks? so it needed some extra attention. I told the attendant that we drove to Vegas and back last weekend so the front end had quite a few bugs that needed to be removed. He said that it would be no problem.nnThe car was cleaned in a timely manner and we left the car wash and went right to the SanTan mall where were meeting friends for an early movie and dinner. My disappointment came when I left the movie theater. It was still light out and you could see how bad of a job that they did on the car. There was unwiped wax all over the car. There were drippings of dried liquid wax all over the car. There were dead and dried bugs now covered with wax all over the front of the car. The mats were wet but clearly hadnt been shampooed. In fact, they didnt even look like that had been vacuumed! I immediately drove back over to the Val Vista location but they had already closed so we cancelled our plans for the rest of the night and brought the car home where I spent another  hours fixing the detail job I spent . on! The wax was so hard and dried that it had to be washed off. The front end was so nasty that I had to use a bug sponge to clean the wax covered bugs off. The mats were so nasty that I had to pull and shampoo them on my own. The only thing they did a good job of was the application of the armor all on the interior. Oh wait, I asked them NOT to apply armor all and to simply wipe the interior down so they screwed that up too!nnThis is now three consecutive washes that have required additional attention. In fact, my Ford Excursion detail was so bad that they had to rewash it and redetail it. I dont know if its a change in management, understaffing or a limit on the amount of time they have available to spend on a car, but I can honestly say that I am completely dissatisfied with the service at Classic Car Spa as of late. As a previously loyal customer Im extremely disappointed!"
0,"The customer service here could be a lot better. The guy who helped me, Marcus, was not that helpful at all. He didnt seem like he wanted to come into work today. He didnt smile or act professional. He actually didnt look like he knew what he was doing. nnI came here for one simple thing and that simple thing was not fulfilled. Terrible service and disappointing visit. Definitely going to a different ATT tomorrow."
0,"I dont know what else to say that hasnt been said before.  My friends and I felt this hotel was not ready to be opened. nnRoomsn First thing I thought when I walked in.  SMALL.  SO, SO, SMALL.  There were  of us in one room and we felt cramped.  n LOVED the mirrors...mirrors everywhere which was probably used to make the room seem bigger.  I like the full length lighted mirrors.  If this hotel goes down...I would buy those off of craigslist.  n I do love how whiteclean everything looked.......but I got over that real quick.n In the middle of our stay, the electricity in our bathroom was out for about  mins.n The water went out at our friends room midshower. When she called downstairs, it seemed like they didnt know how to resolve the issue. Well put you in a new room to sending up someone to fix it, then saying nevermind, its the whole tower...kind of frustrating.n I called downstairs to ask for a thin blanket.  The guy said they dont have blankets and just have flat sheets and that he can send one up.  I thought that was weird and said OK.  Then they sent up a blanket like the one I wanted.  I opened it up and LINT EVERYWHERE!!!!!!  Every time we touched the blanket, stuff would be in the air.  Put the blanket in the corner and didnt even use it. n I forgot to note that on Saturday morning, I was woken up by some noise from the street down below at am.  From a to about a, it was nonstop.  I wasnt sure what it was, but it sounded like a wave....SO ANNOYING especially cuz I was hungover.  I also like to wake up to a DARK DARK room and there were no curtains!  FAIL.nnCasinonCheap tables!  I like that!  Hahaha.  The casino smelled fruity..not sure what it was.  Not bad....nnRestaurantsnHad a couple of my favorites from LA  Griddle, Cleo, Umami,  Degrees I didnt try these restaurants here, but if the quality is as good as the ones in LA, that would be a plus.  I also wanted to try the SLS Buffet, but didnt get around to it.  Heard it was pretty good.   nKu Noodle  Food was tasty but pretty pricey for dimsumchinese food.  nPerq  Nice quick place to get coffee and gelato on the go.  nnPool  Area looked nice but I didnt go swimming.nnSayers Club  Went briefly around am to just dance into the night.  The music was good.  Apparently, Vegas doesnt play hip hop anymore because it causes trouble.  This place had a good mix and not just edm.nnOverall  I most likely wont stay here again.  Its too far from the rest of the strip and it does not offer anything to compensate for that.  I would possibly come back for the restaurants, but most likely not."
0,"I dont come in here often because the products are subpar and the selection is limited.  We like to come here after a holiday to pick up holiday items on the cheap.  The best time is after Valentines Day and after Halloween.....you can find some stuff for future Halloween Parties, ie plates, napkins, decorations for  off.nnWill I return?  Only on those occasions above."
0,"Eh. Nothing special. I was hungover and waiting for my flight so was excited to see a burger joint, but was overall disappointed.nnI got a Ruby Cheeseburger with cheddar cheese, fries, and a small drink. It came out to  which is ridiculous even for an airport.nnThe burger itself was average tasting as were the fries. It was extremely greasy, however, to the point where I took my first bite and a gallon of grease hit my shorts which are now ruined.  Everyone who didnt order the burger which were two people had to wait  minutes for their order. It was a chicken sandwich and a turkey sandwich so cant see why this would take that much longer.nnAlso, soda refills were .. If you require people to get their own soda from the soda fountain you should make the refills free. nnNot your worst option, but youre better off going to Chilis Too which is a one minute walk down."
0,HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!! Very very slow and not attentive. Chips were never filled and drink refills came slowly and only when asked. Our waitress disappeared for long stretches at a time. The food was ok but not great. The rice was bland and the kids meals came about five minutes after everyone else.
0,"This place was as real disappointment.   When you are spending a decent amount of  for a good meal there are reasonable expectations to have.  Like nice atmosphere, excellent food and great service.  Well the atmosphere is the only one that fits into that category.   It was warm, romantic, and the view was awesome.  Things go down hill after that.  Our waiter took forever to even come over to us, hands us menus walks away.  Finally after quite awhile comes over to take our drink order.  We did not have a wine list.  Instead of offering us one, he just says well what do you like?  STill would have been nice to see a list.  Next our salads are brought out.  Caesars and they are pretty good.  Next our steaks come out.  Mine is rare I wanted medium.  So I show it to him and he is like Oh, let me take that back, he knew right away it was wrong.  So my husband is eating while Im sitting there.  The steak comes back and half of it is still too pink...send it back again! nWe had mashed potatos that needed more seasoning so we added saltpepper.  nDessert we ordered creme brulee.  I have made better my self.  There was hardly any carmelized sugar on top, and the custard was very bland.   I have to say our waiter was totally consumed with a larger group of .  My husband and I felt neglected on a service stand point and a food stand point. The waiter brought me a on the house glass of wine to try to rectify the problem with the steak, but It wasnt enough to fix the dinning experience. I  was really disappointed in the whole experience, especially when you are paying that much .  I will never go back here again, theres too many other good options in Vegas to pay alot of money for crappy service and not great food."
0,"Make sure if you go here for an oil change, that your oil cap is on before you leave. I noticed an oil leak after an oil change and found my oil cap laying on top of the motor. I went back again for another oil change, told them what had happened, and to please make sure the cap is replaced. Once again I noticed an oil leak and find the oil cap laying on the motor. Once ok, but twice?"
0,I was really excited to try to this restaurant because of the reputation it had.  Bobby Flay...you pretentious bastard! Stop putting chipotle and cilantro on everything.  Whats sad is that the buffet had tastier meats than this overrated place.  Poor people who freakin wait the  hr lines just to get a mediocre steak priced at  with no sides.  Best part of this place was the exit.
0,"Not a good place to stay. Not convenient, hotel service is not good, ice machine was not working in our floor, rooms does not smell fresh and lobby is not accessible. Hotel employees are not professional. Not coming back ever.., sorry!"
0,"Ive seen many Cirque du Soleil.  According to many individuals, O is considered one of the best.  However, I would like to disagree.  I expected a lot more from O considering that the cost compared to other cirque du soleil shows.  Dont get me wrong.  I was impressed by some of the acts, but what I was most impressed was the stage how it transitions seamlessly from water to stage and viceversa.  The show can be slow at times the intermission with the clowns is quite boring.  I didnt buy my tickets in advanced, so I had to buy tickets with limited view.  My advice is DONT.  Youre not saving much money if any, and the view is terrible especially when the lights on stage shined right at you upper session.   Not only can you not see the acts but youre blinded by the lights.  They should have designed the seating better.  I went to see Le Reve, which is a similar show, and every seats is a great seat.  I actually believe that Le Reve is a better show than O."
0,"Wow! This place is awful! Okay, so I came here on a very busy day ASU vs. Ntre Dame, but the only reason we ate here is it is one of the few places that wasnt so packed to the gills that we could not find a table. I know why. The food is downright awful. Its cute and I like the atmosphere but that doesnt make up for the terrible quality food. I had the Ncounter omelette and the hollandaise sauce was the worst thing I have ever tasted. I think it came from a mix or a jar. Gawd, it was bad.I tried scraping it off but the rest of my omelette was so awful, it wasnt worth eating. It was supposed to have chicken, mushrooms and broccoli and cream cheese, but mostly it was broccoli. I think two tiny bites of processed chicken were in there. My husband ordered the Big Juan, which is supposed to have chorizo and cheese and be some sort of Mexican thing, but literally, there was no chorizo and the only cheese was a sprinkle on top and then the rest of if was crappy salsa poured on top. It was inedible. Naturally, there is no one we can talk to because it was so busy. The wait staff came and took our plates and did not say a word about the fact that they were both  full of food. My husband was really teed at me for saying, lets eat here...it isnt that busy. Our friends waited for  minutes for a table at Gordon Biersch and we didnt want to do that..but hey...they got some great food. some of the other food that came out of the kitchen looked pretty good, like the French toast, but it probably sucked also. PASS!"
0,"It makes me feel bad when I criticize small, familyowned establishments.  On the other hand, fellow Yelpers also deserve to know about my experience as it might help someone avoid frustration and disappointment.nn  Do not go there expecting it to be quick.  It took  minutes for my order to arrive and it was a very basic order  a BBQ chicken bowl and a musubi  which are staples at a place like this.  It was painfully slow and for no apparent reason.  There were  people ahead of me in line when I got there.  There was nobody else waiting around for food.  They had been open about  minutes.  nn  Re customer service.  I stood there waiting and was obviously getting antsy, but received no acknowledgement.  Instead, the lady at the counter avoided eye contact with me.  Finally, after more than  minutes, I asked about my order, thinking maybe theyd forgotten it.  She curtly told me that mine takes awhile to cook really, a chicken bowl? and it would be coming soon.  After  more minutes, she finally handed me my bag, without saying a word.nn  The meat on the musubi was the thinnest Ive ever seen of hundreds, if not thousands, that Ive eaten in my life and it was overcooked.  Fail.  nn  The chicken bowl was okay.  Tasted like your basic chicken bowl.  Not a lot of chicken, though.   I wasnt expecting much since it was a bowl and not one of the plate lunches, but still, it was pretty skimpy.  Enough for me, but if youre hungry, be forewarned.nnOverall, despite my love of Hawaiian BBQ, this was a bad experience.  But I suppose if youre in the neighborhood and craving it, and you have a lot of time and low expectations, it would be okay."
0,"Soooo I wish I could give NOVE   stars but Im rounding...being a restaurant in Las Vegas I was expecting not only good food, but great service...it was my last night there with my boyfriend and we wanted to do a nice dinner. Since we were staying at Palms Place we thought wed try NOVE. OMG...who designed that place?! Being an opera singer I would love to sing in that place when its empty but as a customer it was awful being able to hear EVERYONE! I have never in my life been in such a loud restaurant. We thought it was because of a large party in the main room but even when we moved and the people left I could hear everyone like they were sitting right next to me. I had a huge headache the whole time. On top of that our waiter was kinda a douche and didnt even really pay attention to us. I asked for a TASTE of the Pinot noir to see if I liked it and he just brought me a whole glass like it was what I ordered. He really didnt seem to give a crap.nnAs far as the food was concerned the beef tartar was fantastic! The amuse Bouche that came out before was really boring and sort of flavorless some sort of bruschetta. I ordered the side dish of gnocchi as my entree...it was bigger than my bfs entree! It was also really good the next evening. However, aside from the beef tartar none of the food was very memorable. My boyfriend said the pizza was really good but being sorta a pizza snob I just thought it was decent but nothing fantastic.nnFood starsnService.nnI wouldnt waste my money on NOVE again when there are so many good restaurants in Vegas with servers who actually give a crap and food that will really blow my mind. My advice...head to Scarpetta at the Cosmopolitan."
0,"Ive been to this location a few times and they are always slow, but after my last visit I wont ever be going back. I went through the drivethru at about pm, there were  cars ahead of me. I placed my order of a combo with a shake, boneless wings a medium shake and a small shake. The car in front of me gets to the window and they literally sat there for  minutes, the only item I saw them hand the car was a bag of ice! I finally get to the window, pay, get my order and after about a total of  minutes from start to finish, I drive away. I get home and realize they didnt give me the boneless wings and one of the shakes was wrong. So I called them letting them know their mistake and the girl on the phone told me to bring the receipt in and I could either get refunded for the wings and shake or I could get the food. I told her I would be back in the morning to get a refund. Next morning I give them the receipt and explain what happened and the girl working there didnt want to give me a refund, she said I could only get the food. I told her absolutely not, I spoke with an employee on the phone and they told me I could get the money back. Finally, after arguing and getting the manager involved I got my money back. Nobody ever apologized for the incident. Rude and incompetent."
0,"Came in line at pm and to give you an idea of our line placement, the line wrapped around twice before reaching the front. Seems relatively short  or so we thought. We got to the front and paid at  only to wait in a second line before getting seated. We finally got seated at . WTF a  hr wait on a WEEKDAY? For this wait, I was hoping that the food would be mindblowing. nnFOOD While there was a huge selection, the quality of the food was comparable to HOMETOWN BUFFET or GOLDEN CORRAL. It was low quality food placed in an upscale setting. Well guess what? The food is still shitty. Huge selection of desserts and only a few tasted edible. nnSERVICE our busboy was extremely rude and took plates that we were still eating from. Didnt ask if we were done with them or anything. Also, he never came around to ask if we wanted refills on our sodas even though everyone in the table clearly had empty cups. nnAlso, the  discount for Californians only lasts until . The BF and I had to pay full price which was . each for lunch to eat hometown buffet quality food. Even for . I would not return bc the damn wait is ridiculous."
0,"It feels upscale.  You get the sense that its fine dining or, at least, freshmade food served by people who care.  nnUm, no.nnMy wife and I stopped for lunch at MS today after business on the South Side.  Relatively empty, even at .n.  nnThe server was pleasant and attentive enough. I appreciated his solid service.nnI ordered a caesar salad and the fish and chips.  My wife ordered a mixed green salad and the trout.  The romaine lettuce is my salad was turning brown at the edges and I found only TWO croutons, neither of which had any garlic flavor though promised on the menu. Clearly the lettuce was days old.  My wifes salad has several rotten not just brown but rotten pieces of greens.  How hard and expensive is it to serve FRESH salads?  The fries chips on my plate were cold, even though they were UNDER the fish.  I had barely a tablespoon of tartar sauce for the healthy portion of fish that I was served.  The fish was good.  I also received a small halfcup or so of cole slaw that was one step from frozen.  Like the salads, obviously days old.  Nothing on my wifes plate, not the trout, the green beans or the pasta, was seasoned at all. Very bland and tasteless.  nnVERY disappointing.  And I suspect that the server knew this because when he cleared the entrees he asked Can I get you anything else? and NOT How was lunch?  nnNot that Im cheap, but my wife turned back the salad without eating but a bitefull yet the waiter made no effort to take it off the bill.  nnVERY disappointing.   for lunch.  Thank God we had a  gift card.  I was out only the  for the tip."

0,"Looked for a gay bar to see a drag show for halloween. I called and was told there was no cover it was free entertainment and drag show and the flyer in the ad stated the same..  upon arrival there was a line to get in and we got there about  pm.

I explained that the flyer said no cover and I do not drink, was told that was because they had a special show at  am and costume contest.  their advertising had stated no cover.  after waiting and spending  dollars for cover and my friends . drinks at  am there was still no show... I was forced to leave as my medication of labetolol was causing me to be drowsy.

Well the bathrooms male and female had waterurine all over the floor and could not be used...

0,"I arrived to this nail shop after work at  PM. Initially they were really nice I wanted an acrylic fill in and a pedicure. I picked out a polish and got my toes done and the polish began to bubble. I then asked them to change my toenail polish once I saw them putting it on my fingers and it looked awful because of all the bubbling. They changeed my fingernail polish but tried to charge me to change my toe nail polish, though it was their polish that was going to bad. When I refused they made me wait  minutes to change my toenail polish and took several customers before me, though I had been there first. When I began to pay she asked me if I was leaving a tip and I responded no, she threw  my card down on the counter. I voiced that I did not feel valued as a customer and they had awful customer service and that I felt like they were disrespecting my time. I will never return there ever again. I havent had a bad experience at a nail shop in years. They never have to worry about me again."
0,"Stopped here to pick up some baked goods while waiting for a seat at Zada Janes. A friend who was visiting wanted to stop. I thought that for a bakery, they had kind of slim pickings, but then again I had just gone to Amelies the day before and gotten my socks knocked off. I wasnt at all impressed with their selection of sweet bakery items. It looked like they could have an impressive bread selection, but most of the compartments were vacant. nnMy friend ended up getting an iced latte, which was nothing to write home about. We ended up getting a cannoli and baklava. The baklava didnt disappoint, though Im not a huge fan. nnFor the person who said theyd go back for the cannoli, though.... dont. One reason I love cannolis is that theyre a savory item. The ricotta filling isnt too sweet, its just right for those people who like flavor over sugar. This cannoli was so loaded with sugar that I felt like I was eating a donut. I was extremely disappointed  its hard to screw up a cannoli, but it happened. nnThe one saving grace on the way in, they had free samples set up for a new olive tapenade they were selling. Im not sure if it was one they made, but it definitely did look like it was made and packaged there. It was definitely the most delicious and flavorful tapenade that I can remember eating, and they put out just the right kind of bread with it. It was beautiful. And that tapenade added another star to this review."
0,"Good. This place is good. Not great, but good. The food is prepared by people who clearly know what theyre doing. Its not spectacular, its not innovative, but its tasty, and ... good. The margaritas  the one I had anyway  were tasty and fresh.nnBut everything is badly, BADLY overpriced.nnThis isnt fine Mexican dining in Paradise Valley ... its friggin Chandler. If Im paying  for a single margarita it better be prepared right there at my table, or served by a Mariachi band, or something. Like I said, it was good ... but not THAT good. nnSame goes with the food. And order of shrimp enchiladas got me two normalsize enchiladas, rice bleh and tasty black beans .... and it was all good.

0,"ive always been a hot n juicy fan and when boiling crab came here to vegas, my friends have a  review on it so I HAVE to try it myself. Needless to say, i wasnt very impressed. our server was very nice though and the dozen fresh oysters we got were phenomenal, otherwise i wouldve given this place just  star. We pretty much ordered everything on the menu since it was our first time  girls and a table full of food  we got the shrimp, the lobster, the king crab legs, and the snow crab legs. All of them were EXTREMELY DRY. the shrimp were overcooked, some of it were mushy, some of it you can barely peel coz the shells all sticking to the meat. the lobster was a disappointment, cracked it open, and the meat was dry and tough. the crab legs were the same, dry and tough meat everywhere. the flavor of the sauce we got the whole shebang one was a little bland for our taste. the interior decor was nice though, but as far as the food, not a big fan."

0,Salon of Arrogancenn In May of  I made an appointment with Lane. I arrived for my appointment to the place dark and locked with no one in sight. No one called to say they would not be there andor to reschedule the appointment. I had rearranged my whole day just for that appointment that was set for PM. I drove from south Chandler to the location on Val Vista. The next day Lane did call my house number to say to call back and lets get me in. I called back and from there all fell silent. No one return the call to set up another appointment. Over the months I thought that the next time I was in that area I was going to make a point of stopping in to A see if the place was still in business and B if Lane was there to eyeball the type of individual that is in the service industry that would have no respect for a potential customer that was willing to give them business. That day happened this past Friday. I was in the area and made a point of stopping in to have a look see. Lane was there in all his arrogant glory. When I told him that I just wanted to eyeball the individual I had an appointment with that not only did not call to let me know that he was not going to make the appointment he could not even be bothered to show up for the appointment he quite smugly smiled and just said Sorry and went on about with his client in the chair. As I was leaving the one man and a chair hole in the wall business they obviously found this situation to be quite humorous for I heard laughing. This salon is obviously a selfabsorb arrogant unprofessional business. If this fits your style you will feel right at home
0,"Pro Tech Auto came out to my place of business just before  this morning to fix a star shaped crack in my windshield.  Unfortunately, what was a nickel sized star nick near the corner of my windshield mysteriously turned into an   inch crack.  It was not cracked in that manner this morning when I got in or out of my car.  The sun roof was open and it was parked next to a tree that partially shaded the windshield and the car was parked facing away from the morning sun. n nThe technician never came into my place of business to find me or find out where my car was parked  cars in the parking lot.  nThe technician somehow found my car and parked in front of it.  I do not know exactly what transpired after his arrival, we have security cameras but the trees and his van were  blocking the viewing area. I can only speculate the events.  By the time I walked out to see if he was even out there, he was leaving a note on the windshield saying it could not be repaired.  It needed to be replaced. nThe technician claimed he did not put any pressure on the windshield and claimed that  the crack could have been caused by the sun.nnHere are my issuesnn. Ive had numerous nicks and cracks over the years on different windshields, never has one mysteriously gotten worse the day it was being repaired.nn. Unfortunately, I was not a witness to the events that transpired. So,. I cannot honestly blame Auto Tech, but the technician never came in to find me before starting to work on my car.  Its frustrated to realize that the only way of letting me know it needed to be replaced was to simply leave a note on my windshield.  He had my number, why not call me to come and see it for myself?  I caught him sitting in his truck with the motor running without any form of contact between us.  Im very puzzled by this companies customer service.  nn.  I feel that even though the technician denied putting any pressure on the windshield,  I feel he was dishonest.  It obviously cost the insurance company  much more to replace a windshield than to pay for the repair.  Could this be a normal practice when its the insurance companies dime?n nEven though the insurance company pays for the replacement, they probably wont pay for OEM that I want back in my car and I have to find a way to get the new windshield lightly tinted as was it originally....of course in this state, that is illegal.nnWhile I appreciate the followup call from the owner after the events that transpired today......Sorry, Pro Tech Auto Glass, coincidence or not,  I will not use nor recommend your services to anyone in the future.  nnDisgruntle and Bewildered"

Ive driven by this place  or  dozen times since I moved into the area, and finally just tried it. I bought the bacon cheeseburger combo. This burger had a lot of potential, but it was cooked too long making the meat really dry. The buns were toasted on the outside to the point where they were blackened a little and were hard. However, the choice of thousand island with caramelized onions which were done almost to perfection by the way added some flavor, making it edible. They gave me a LOT of fries, which I prefer, and they were nice and hot. My guess is the fry cook left the burger on the grill while he put down fresh fries, and ended up overcooking the meat. Ill probably give it another try, but I will wait until lunch time on a weekday when the burgers are flying fresh off the grill and Im hoping I have better luck."
0,"The marvel experience was not marvelous at all.  It was indeed terrible, I must say.  I understand this is the second day it has been open but nothing was working well.  The lines were extremely long to get in and once inside there were lines for everything!!!  Picture disney lines and multiply that by  and then only to arrive to things that you can do at other places like the laser maze, or a climbing wall. The better things were not working well at all.  The wrist bands were lame and not functional, the d and d movies were not d at all.  The total experience was terrible and I ended up apologizing to my family from out of the country to have taken them there on their vacation.  My kids say they would only go back if they got paid.  As for me, they would for sure have to pay me a lot to go back.  I highly recommend putting all of the employees through the experience because many of them could not explain how it worked or what would be next, also, you need to manage the lines a lot better, and of course get the technology to work.  The idea is good but the execution is very poor. I also have requested a refund.  Do not waste your time.  This is more for kids than adults but even the kids did not like it."
0,"Conveniently located next to Trader Joes.nnPurchase food or janatorial items in bulk...like a teeny fraction size of Costco.nnClean store.nnService...not so great.  nnEach time I have stopped in here, there is one cashier and  customers in line like Hobby Lobby.nnMost prices are not so reasonable to lure me back.nnObserved two employees chatting in the aisle, instead of opening another register to expedite customer checkout.nnAfter deciding NOT to wait in the long onecashier line, I left my potential purchases near the register. Instead of opening another register to assist with checking out customers, another employee wasted no time scooping up my abondoned items.nnIm surprised that this business is still open. You get a vibe that the employees hate their job and that management is terrible."
0,"I recently flew through the Charlotte airport twice and was delayed both times, so I spent a considerable amount of time there. The delays werent the fault of the airport itself, but rather the awful service of US Airways. When I was first stuck in this airport for over  hours because of a delayed flight, I wanted to charge my phone. Well, I dont know why they have so few outlets, but when you find one its like winning the lottery. People were scouring the airport everywhere looking for outlets. We happened to find one and everyone in my group just used it in turns. I even saw some people sitting in the bathroom next to an outlet charging their phones and laptops.  The outlet situation is crazy!nnI found the restaurant and food choices to be rather limited, but at least there was something. nnAs we were flying back through Charlotte to catch out second flight, we had to go through immigration and customs, because we got off an international flight. As we made our way into immigration, the line wasnt super long, so many people just ducked under the ropes to avoid walking through many rows of empty lanes. These people didnt cut in front of anyone, they just wanted to avoid having to walk pointlessly through empty zig zag after empty zig zag of the line. There was a very angry woman who came running and yelled at everyone. She made them all get back out of lines and walk to the end. She then forced them to walk through each empty section of the line. They actually ended up in the EXACT position, since they hadnt skipped in front of anyone anyway.  This lady was crazy. She was all the talk in the Immigration line. She was definitely channeling Nurse Ratched One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest. We had hoped to get through immigration quickly as the line wasnt super long, but we were wrong. The immigration officers were awfully chatty and there werent many of them. So, it took an exceptionally long time compared to the length of the line. Customs went much more quickly. nnIn the future, I will avoid going through this airport, but if I have to be there, Im bringing a lawn chair for the immigration lines and a power strip to share outlets with others."
0,"I mean what can you say, its a Starbucks in an airport. I dont know whether to blame the cashier that rang me up or the guy that was making the drinks, but on top of messing up the drink order for the lady before me, he also messed up mine, so it obviously took double the time to get the drinks. Even with him having to remake mine, it was still slightly off. He did kinda have this Im just here to work swagger, not much in the attentive customer service department.nnIt is what it is, at least its the same prices and not more expensive compared to a regular Starbucks location. They do take the Starbucks card for payment, so thats a plus."
0,"..nnI dont know why I almost always end my trip reviews with a bad one on a fast food restaurant at the airport.  This is no different.nnSeriously, I know life sucks when you work at a fast food restaurant at the airport.  If you dont want to work there, maybe you should find another job.  Its definitely not good for business when you have a sour look on your face while you point me to another cashier because you dont feel like taking my order.nnI did get an extra piece of nugget.  In your face."
0,Purchased a  XTS Mar th.  Instinct told me to walk out of the Dealership but I decided to stay.  After almost  hours I drove the car off the lot.  I am not at all impressed with this dealership.  Problems got worse trying to get the DMV Doc and as of Apr  I still do not have the DMV Doc.  I would not recommend this dealership to anyone looking for efficient service.  People are very nice but terrible at customer service and competency.
0,"I was here on business and ate four meals at food establishments in the Luxor property. On each occasion the food was generally of decent standard but once it had arrived I was only approached by the wait staff to see if I wanted the check and have my plate cleared. Would have been nice to have at least inquired if everything was ok. nnHouse keeping didnt show up for the first two days and I didnt have a do not disturb sign on the door. nnThe pool area and towels are free to hotel guests and you are invited to play a game of seek the loungers after am. The hotel has three pools but strangely two are roped off for and unused by the people paying  for cabanas and premium sunloungers. Music is trash chart guff. nnLike most places in Vegas when youre inside you will end up smelling like an ashtray and so will your clothes. nnNo wifi anywhere but theres a  foot cable for free wired Internet access. Its not obvious and you have to ask the front desk about it.  nnThe business center isnt available but you can pay  for  minutes of access to a terminal near the payphones that everyone can read over your shoulder. nnOverall, the room was adequate, but I wouldnt stay at the Luxor if offered a choice again."
0,Been coming here for over  years to get HID after market lights from Brian on my Suburbans and have prob been back  plus times because the lights either go out while Im driving or the relay kits are bad. I thought it was normal but Ive literally had to come back multiple times for the same vehicles over the years and Ive had times where both my headlights go out at night with clients in my vehicle. The kits Im sure are bought from China and are not meant for a lot of the vehicles hes installing them in. Brian looks at my like this never happens to anybody else except your vehicles. I find that hard to believe because my assistant is sitting in his lobby right now with another gentlemen that said this is his rd time in there for the same issue with his HID lights. Brian is rude to me on the phone and the first couple years I referred a lot of clients to him but now I realize the products hes selling are junk and from another country. If its not one thing it another. I called him today and he was short with me and irritated. The last thing I want to do is have to come to your shop multiple times in a year for the same problem. He looks at me like its my fault every time I call him or show up with one headlight out. If youre going to get after market headlights here make sure you get some type of warranty and if you have to go back multiple times for the same problem in the first year I highly recommend you put your stock lights back in and not have to deal with the headache of driving out to mesa and waiting around to have your lights fixed multiple times a year. Im a business owner myself and takes me a lot to give any type of business a bad review but Brian has made it very uncomfortable doing business with him as hes rude and arrogant on the phone with me. This will be the last time myself or my staff steps a foot into this business. Youre not doing me a favor not charging  me every time I come in with a headlight out. Do the job right the first time and save these customers the time of not having to come back out multiple times a year. Its been nothing but a headache with these after market HID lights on my  to  suburbans. Ive recently bought new  model vehicles which have the stock HID headlights so that will save me the headache of ever having to come back to Get HID headlights.
0,"Came here on Wednesday night around pm and my companion and I ordered a couple of beers. The server brought out beers and it was  inches not filled. I said whats goin on here she proceeded to tell me that, that is where the head was. No shit! Its because you let it sit in the window too long. No only was that a servers laziness, the bartender should have repoured the beers or at least filled them up. There was only  person sitting at the bar."
0,"DO NOT STAY HERE! I have had better treatment at a Motel . Your personal belongs are not safe here. We shall be seeking legal representation in regards to our appalling stay. Expect damage to your property and them not to take any responsibility for their staffs actions.  Upon my stay I waited close to an hour to check in to a room that I paid for over TWO MONTHS AGO. The staff was unfriendly, and the doorman sexually harassed on our way out during our first nights stay.  Not one staff member was able to give me any direction to and from places in or around the hotel.  I was not told where my room was, it was left to wander the hotel.  Security was unfriendly, I sat at a penny slot I am  years old after walking around aimlessly throughout the casino waiting for my room, and was treated like a juvenile that broke a law.  Housekeeping damaged my friends Cartier watch she specifically took off and left in the room so it would not be damaged.  Upon complaint after complaint they were unapologetic and lacked any sort of empathy.  I was asked why it wasnt put in the safe. I didnt realize I had to put my luggage in a small safe.  Your belongs are probably safer at a crack motel on the other side of the freeway."
0,"Came here for the first time last Thursday for lunch. The waitress told me what the special was, so I ordered it. The special was a BLT crab sandwich. When it arrived, it still had the soft shell on it and it was fried. She told me the soft shell was edible, but I dont like eating fried food. So I tried it. It tasted nasty and was very deeply fried. I ended up getting sick to my stomach. I also saw her mess up another patrons order while I was there. I couldnt believe it. He also had ordered the special and by the looks on his face, he wasnt impressed at all.  I know this place has a lot of great reviews, but my experience wasnt that great. No more for me. The prices were fair, hence the two stars."
0,I love my new convertible!    Heres my updateFI D be careful!  I had to stay up on getting the payoff completed in a timely manner.  A late fee was assessed and I had to fu to get it deducted.  I emailed D and her response was beyond rude!   from when I was signing the contract.  What a disappointment.  Customer service is only  while your signing.
0,"Undoubtedly the ghastliiest food experience we have ever endured. My wife and I are very seasoned travelers, i am English and work on cruise ships across the globe,  weeks a year. We are also food adventurers and eat in some the oddest places, especially in the Far East. But this was utterly abysmal. Chicken and beef fajitas that had past their sell by date at least  days prior  stale chips, guacamole the strangest shade of khaki and salsa which resembled something that had been meticulously scraped from the bottom of a parrot cage. We paid begrudgingly only because the waitress was so attentive mostly to distract us from whats as languishing on our plates. The following day, today, I have even had a bad stomach. My wife phoned the manager this afternoon, not looking for recompense or a free meal god forbid but merely to point out how poor the food was, and was curtly informed that it was our fault because we didnt complain enough at the time! This is truly the Mexican Fawlty Towers and not quite so funny either. If you are considering eating here, I would avoid this place like hemerrhoids.nBy the way, avoid the churros like Ebola. I was still chewing the wretched thing  minutes after leaving the restaurant."
0,"I went to Frys in order to purchase some ink for a printer at work.  I was helped in the computer department and told the sales associate the model number and icon of the HP Ink a bowtie.  When he brought me something else, I asked that he confirm it and he became agitated and told me that he knew what he was doing.  So, I paid for six cartridges and put my receipt away.  nnAs Im leaving, the two teenagers up front finally stop talking and ask for my receipt, which irritated me, but its their policy.  She looked at the receipt, marked it and then handed it back to me...without checking my bags at all.  At this point, Im extremely agitated and complained to the person that was with me about my frustrations.  To ice the cake, the same teenager made an exasperated whew noise about my complaining.  nnSeveral hours later, found out that the cartridges were, in fact, wrong and the only sollace the manager could give me was...well, I wont charge you for opening one of the boxes.  nnI do have to thank Frys for making me an internet shopper on these items as their location and service is unacceptable."
0,Let me start out and say Iveve been a long time customer of The Devil.  My friends and I have spent thousands over the past many years..... BUT on Monday went there on Aprils Fools Day and my friend and I ordered for lunch The Pizza and Wing Special  and ONE Soda and a glass of water .... Let me add that we ordered TWO Toppings on the pizza .... Pepperoni and Sausage .... Food was good and I am one NOT To Complain But Give Compliments  as I know its a TOUGH Business to nbe in ...  At the end of our meal I asked for the check and it was for OVER THIRTY FIVE DOLLARS for ONE PIZZA With TWO TOPPINGS  And TWENTY WINGS and ONE Soda ..... As I looked at our check I mentioned to my friend  no wonder the place is empty. Back in the day this place was packed and all I Know there are many other choices out there to spend thirtyfive dollars for pizza and wings .... Oh by the way that Thirtyfive dollars DIDNT include the tip for our server .......

0,"Finally made to Tacos Atoyac after many months of waiting. In my own opinion, after the wait and all the praise, I was disappointed. Menu items are very inexpensive, but also very small. The food did not taste bad though it didnt knock me out either it just was. Not really sure where all the praise is coming from, but then again, it could be just me."

0,"I hadnt eaten all day. I stumbled across this spot after freezing walk up St Catherine. I walked in because all you can eat sounds good when you havent eaten in awhile. Came in no one greeted me just met with a blank stare and sat me at a four person table. Didnt bother to ask me if I wanted anything or advise on how the all you can eat worked there. The waitresses were extremely unresponsive and almost seemed annoyed when you would ask for something. The sushi was ok, definitely didnt make up for the bitchy attitudes that experienced. Theres several other sushi spots in Montreal that you can choose over this place. I wont be coming here again and neither should you."
0,This place is disgusting!!!!!! Do not come here for drinks OR food. The place is always dead and it still takes  minutes for food to come to the table. The drinks are over priced and they are weak. Hopefully someone will come around and buy out this place and put it out of its misery soon.
0,Wish I could say better but we have tried  or  times since the opened every time the same slow service Im not sure the have a heat lamp in back cause the food comes out in the order it was cooked so my pizza would come out then  minutes later my wife cheeseburger in the mean time you sit there with the waitress passing you by and your drinks are empty. We gave it multiple trys figuring there were some things the needed to work out from being new but food not coming out at the same time for only  people? Not sure if there understaffed or poorly managed? Last night we went again and same thing slow service no drinks when you ordered one it took  minuets to get it. We ordered cheese garlic bread I had chicken wings. It took fore ever for the appetizer it finally showed up then a minute later the wings I thought they called it a appetizer for a reason? Then  min later my wife beef sandwich that literally had two slices of beef? My chicken wings were ok and I got a hole  inch piece of celery and the same with the carrot. I think they have potential but need to fix some things fast. The only positive thing I can say is that the atmosphere was good. I hope the fix this and we will try again as managing a business of my own I dont wont to see anyone fail. Good Luck
0,"It is your standardissue Chinese joint complete with the same menu, food pictures, employees with the minimum English clarity that you find at all of these places.nnFor the first time since moving to the Belmont area, i craved some Chinese. i had noticed this little Chinese joint next to the Papa Johns in the BiLo shopping strip and we decided to give it a try. nnWe were waiting for a car to get done with an oil change so we opted to eat inside this little place. Had we gotten takeout, it may have been  stars because the food wasnt too shabby. Pretty standard General Tso chicken, although the broccoli was as cold as the seating area which required us to wear our jackets. nnSurprisingly they didnt overcharge for a canned beverage and they did have a selfserve tea station. nnWhile we were eating, we heard one of the cooks make the most obscene throat clearing noise that you usually only hear in the movies. It sounded like he was struggling to bring up a major loogie that was trapped deep within his soul. Fortunately we already had our food. nnIf youre desperate for Chinese, get it to go."
0,"Never seen such a horribly designed parking structure at a convention center. Whenever theres a convention going on, its virtually impossible to leave the place during shutdown. Everyone is cramped in the lot w hundreds of cars trying to leave at the same time. Then, they hire a bunch of security guards to guide traffic. These people are rude and no professional. One dude comes knocking on my car to tell me to stop going while i was jammed on the pedestrian crosswalk.nnLabor unions are a  to deal with. nnThe place does have a Starbucks and a American Express OPEN lounge."
0,"So youve been walking up and down fremont street a couple of times getting drunk off the fat tuesday in your hand and suddenly the sign you passed at least  times begins to sound appealing to you . burger and fries at Binions cafe.nnId say the best time to go to this cafe is when youve been drinking, its late, youre hungry, and you could give a shit about the the cigarette smell, the service, or the taste. nnStumble in here during your fremont experience, seat yourself, order off the sticky menu, find a filled bottle of ketchup from a nearby empty table and enjoy your meal. Who cares what it tastes like, its food."

0,This has to be the worst TexMex Ive ever had. The fare is way overpriced and the margaritas are triplesec heavy so there you go. If you want to pay too much for bad food and drink this is your place.
0,"I am a Las Vegas regular and we always eat at the best and hottest restaurants in Vegas.  We decided to try this place to get something different.  The restaurant itself has a horrible set up.  The flow of the tables and divided rooms are quite odd.nnThe food was marginal at best.  The prices were equivalent to Nobu, but the food was equivalent to PF Changs.  I would never go here again for the price or atmosphere.  There are many better options in Vegas."
0,"Ive been here twice now, each time with blah results.  Both times Ive had youngish stylists that did not seem to know how to  style curly hair. I blow dry my hair twice a week, styled straight, and it takes me less than  minutes plus a quick run through the top layer with a flat iron. Im bewildered as to how it can take someone over  minutes here, and leave me with a frizzy s prom look. I did see several other stylists with clients that left looking amazing. I asked for one of their names  Chanel and would not go back here unless you had a name referral of a stylist."
0,"Dangerous!!!nnOur meal was so so, had to send back the margarita, and we ordered lemon pepper wings that had virtually no lemon pepper on them.nnWhen we ordered dessert, I asked if the brownie had nuts, the server said Im not sure, but I know for sure the blonde brownie doesnt.  I said sure.  It came out with a scoop of ice cream covering the whole thing so I couldnt see that it was filled with huge walnut chunks.  I took one bite, started to react and went to the bar to get water.  As we are trying desperately to get out of there so I can get some benadryl, my dad has to stay behind to pay the bill.  They took off my dessert that I couldnt eat and my moms dessert. That was it.nnVery scary for a nut allergy to be told that something for sure doesnt have nuts.

0,"Ate at Garcias a few times over the years.  Up until tonight, it has always been a dependable place to get some good food with some good service.  We arrived later in the night and the place was maybe  full, but still had to stand up front waiting for anybody to greet us or seat us for a few minutes.  nnI ordered an iced tea that ended up tasting odd to me, but the server was nice about getting me something different.  However, the half drank tea cup remained on the table, stacked on two small dirty plates and were still on the table when we left.  nnThe salsa and beans which every table gets were eaten quickly, but we were never asked if we would like more. Several tables around me were asked several times if they would like more.  The food was tasty and the restaurant was clean."
0,"Man..what a disappointment.nnI heard so many good things about this place, and after some of the Yelp reviews, I decided Id go try it out.

Thats not normal. It normally takes  minutes to get a good eyebrow threading done.  When I mentioned that a few spots seemed to be missed, and that I wanted them thinner, I was quickly dismissed because the line up outside was so long nnSo, having driven  minutes to come here, I was really not impressed at all  it was a sucky experience overall. Totally not worth it........"
0,"Bad.  Decent beer selection and okay food.  The service is consistently terrible here.  Please dont listen to the geniuses on here who went during the gold medal hockey game and expected top notch service and split checks.  Anyone from the service industry knows that type of table.  It sounds a bit like extortion too.  Kiss my ass and Ill write you a good review on Yelp.  nnPlease simply trust that the service is terrible whether youre there for a sporting event or a night with nothing going on.  ALWAYS terrible service unless you happen to be one of the dozen regulars there.  Just go to Zipps across the street.  Great addition to the neighborhood with stellar service and delicious food.  I have no business interest in either of these places, but Hazewoods has always given me every reason to stay home and drink beer from the fridge."
0,"Everytime I go to this place I wonder why.  Why do I pay for the VIP wash when they do no more than what you get for the basic?  I went this last weekend and my SUV literally went from vacuum to wash to interior in less than  minutes. nYes, youd think that would be a good thing.  But there were literally  cars ahead of mine in the row it was in.  This place is based on pushing cars through, NOT cleaning them.nnThey did nothing more than smear their cheap version of armorall on the tires and wash the windows.  This is VIP?  What a joke.  I told the attendant who actually spoke english! to run it through again, this was pathetic, but he said, no Ill clean it, and he took a dirty rag out of the back of his shorts he might as well have used his tightywhities, theyd be cleaner and started rubbing down the console and such.  nnYeah, thats what I want.  Danny, you should be ashamed to put your name on this joke of a car wash.  And I should be double ashamed to have run my car through this place repeatedly over the years.   What am I thinking?  Im an idiot.  Never again."
0,"This would be a great neighborhood convenience if it were not for the fact that their opening hours are seemingly random.

0,"Overpriced, small portions and very bland food.  The salsa was the only thing that had any flavor.  The inside dining room is noisy and was only about  full for during our dinner time visit.

0,"I will NEVER go back to this range.  If you dont want to read my lengthy complaints, read this Go to Caswells off the  in Mesa.  nnSome background, I am an experienced shooter  years and a decorated Navy sharp shooter.  nI like going to the desert to shoot because in my experience, staff at ranges and usually arrogant dicks.  C did more than exceed my expectations.  nnBefore I walked in, I read their signs to be sure I was meeting their rules walking in open carry.  My firearm was clear, though within seconds of walking in, I was approached by a staff member, before you walk in, will you be sure a round isnt chambered?  First, I did this.  Second, how does he know I didnt do this because he asked me to clear before I walked in.  I will never unholster my weapon in public unless I intend to fire, and if he wanted me to clear when I walked in, he could have asked me politely when I entered.  I apologized, for whatever I did that wasnt as expected and went about my business.  nnWhen I got to my lane, the range officer noted that the target retrieval device wasnt working properly and moved my to a different lane.  I was all ready to shoot, so before I moved, I dropped my clip,cleared my weapon, moved the ammo over to the lane and then came back for the gun.  When I did that, the range office said, you were supposed to holster your weapon.  I was somewhat confused, so simply apologized and he further said, I just told you that.nI was wearing two sets of hearing protection and whatever this guy muttered to me, was clearly missed.  He was very rude about it after my apology for missing that, when I clearly made an effort to be safe my moving the loaded clip in a separate trip from the empty and cleared gun.nnI popped off two boxes of ammo, and thought about buying another  rounds, so I asked him, how much do you sell ammo for?  Instead of, what size? or what are you looking for?  The jerk in the most annoyed and matteroffact tone of speaking said, that depends on what caliber.  After my purchase I was getting ready to go, my personal items were on a bench behind me and I again made sure the range officer was to see I moved my empty clips separately from the gun to the bench behind me.  As I did so, he straight yelled at me, anytime you are back here you have to holster your weapon.  I was confused because I thought he meant back here as back at the lanes, from the store, and you cant fire a weapon in the holster... I then figure out we was referring to back here as behind the yellow line.  When I asked for clarification, he thought I was being smart with him and spat more attitude at me.  nnEssentially, This was my first and last experience at this range.  I feel that I was targeted as I saw multiple safety violations for other patrons, though this guy for some reason wanted to hold me accountable for all of the unknown published or spoken rules of their range.  nnGo to Caswells off the  in Mesa."
0,"Not impressed.  Food was lousy and the place was dirty.  If you look at the funkylit back wall, it has food and beverages spilled on it and some of the light hardware is missing.  There is an extremely loud machine right inside the door to the kitchen so everytime the staff came out during our presentation, we had to hear that machine buzzing.  The AV was quite poor.  The location and parking was a plus however."
0,"Visit  Sat night. I called in for a reservation and the guy at the end I the phoneline was very nice.  I had perused the menu online and was very excited to eat here.  Similarly when we arrived the hostess was very nice and Eddie was at the hostess stand keeping vigilant watch on the ebb and flow of the seating and said hello.  Big plus.  Unfortunately it went way downhill when we sat down.  The menu was significantly more expensive than was posted online.  We brushed this off and committed ourselves to paying more as good food is worth it however,  we sat for  minutes without any greeting from a server.  The restaurant was very busy and obviously out of controll, so we left and decided to try another night. nVisit  the following sat night. we came in earlier and sat at the bar.  Caesar salad very small, bland and overpriced.  I ordered a specialty drink which was made all wrong and undrinkable, so I pushed it to the edge  and asked for a wine list.  I was given one but was never given the opportunity to order a glass of wine.  Meanwhile oi lamb chops with mint hummus had arrived  yummy.  Unfortunately, one of my boufrienda chops were blue raw. After several attempts to get the bartenders attention  I placed it at the edge of the bar on a plate with the blue side showing next to my untouched disgusting drink.  Our bartender a female never checked on us, never asked how our meal was  she was   feet away almost the whole time!  Really???  Albeit she was busy on service bar, but only had  customers.  You know when someone is staring at you and needs something!  Finally, after mins  I flagged down the other bartender Danny who also happened to be the manager , explained what had happened, and asked if he could cash us out so we could escape.  He graciously assisted us right away  while he was at the computer the bartender barked that she had already cancelled our order.  This cemented my suspicion that she had been studiously and PURPOSFULLY ignoring us.  Anyway  five stars for Danny, a beacon in our twovisit catastrophe and the lamb chops that were cooked. Minus four for that evil harpy of a bartender  shame on you!"

0,"Just say no.nnAt first glance, its cute..and it tells you to come hither.nnSo you do.nnI was expecting awesome food for some odd reason..  mostly because I love pubs, and most of the time the experience is fun and yummy.nnWe arrived as a group of six, and were seated within ten minutes.  So far so good.nnThe menu is fun.  Half of the menu literally, half is their beer selection.  Too bad I only like palelightcrisp beers, so my choices were limited.. but I still enjoyed my Straten, from Germany.  On draftdraught.  nnI was debating between the bison burger never had, and was even contemplating subbing with regular ground beef had I gotten it.. the toppings sounded good..  I think it was blue cheese, celery, carrot.  Now that I wrote it out, it doesnt sound that great at all.  Either way, Ill never know, because I got the fish and chips.  Figured.. its an English pub.. get one of their specialties.  nnMy cousins got the chicken parm sliders.  They actually sound good, even though its not the thing to order anywhere that isnt Italian.  But there was a problem.  So let me ask you this.  When you hear chicken parm, you think breaded chicken breast, right?  Not ground chicken meat with a sour marinara, right?  Well, thats what this was.  Ground chicken.  Why?  It should be named ground chicken sliders with acidic tomato sauce.  And you only get three, and I believe its an entree dish!  Not an appetizer.  Booooo.nnMy fish n chips were good, but nothing that other pubs should be worried about.  Two pieces of fried Cod, and the batter was good.  Crispy, although a bit too thick.  The fish itself was a tad overcooked and rubbery, but shake some malt vinegar on it and youre good to go.  It comes with thicksteak cut fries.  The dipping sauces are tartar and a creamy malt vinegar.  I prefer regular malt vinegar, which you have to ask for..    odd for an English pub.  Usually they have cruets or the Heinz version of it on the table.  ?  Thats not right.  Oh, but it was.nnAnyway, the person who wrote the menu descriptions should be paid a million billion dollars for making everything sound so good.. and unique.  nnAmbiance is cool.  Beer selection is nice.  Food is a definite miss.  Prices are not matched properly to the quality and amount.  Service is very good.  The employees are very friendly and kind."
0,"Food was fantastic and portions were huge. The rest of the experience was not so memorable.  Our waiter obviously did not feel that we were worth the trouble of treating us like all of his other tables around us. He never smiled or  offered us any suggestions when asked. He wandered around the floor talking to his other parties and came back to us after waiting  mins. This was after asking his assistance to get his attention.  He took our order without a word and we did not see him until we complained to the manager about our experience. The manager was great and listened to us, making no excuses for the shaved head waiter from New York who should be working elsewhere. nThe food Fantastic!nThe service.......go somewhere else where they treat locals like family."

0,"My husband and I were craving wings a few weeks ago and decided that this Long Wongs was the place to go.  Or, more likely that this was the only Long Wongs nearby and we were banking on the name of the establishment since other Long Wongs have some great food.  We walked in and immediately felt a bit icky by the dirty feel of the whole place.  We were so hungry that we went ahead and orderd two dozen wings from the girl at  the counter.  She appeared bored and unenthusiastic.  We found seats at a table and waited a LONG time for our order.  During this time of waiting, my eyes wandered around the dirty floor...the sticky table.....the drab furnishings.  We began to wonder if our order had been forgotten.  When we inquired about our food we were told that it would be ready soon and it was.  I think they made it when we asked.  The wings were just okay.  The whole experience was a let down and we will make sure to keep driving when we pass by this Long Wongs."
0,"I finally got a chance to try Cheba Hut after hearing rave reviews about it from several friends. I think my expectations were too high. It was good, but it wasnt GREAT. The toasted subs are comparable to those that you would get at Quiznos but with some more interesting and innovative options. It was almost  for two  subs, one fountain drink, and one dessert. The food is basically fast food, and those are not fast food prices. I might go back again, but probably not soon."

0,"Huh? This was the only nightclub in Vegas that we had to pay for and was not worth one penny. Let me note that the entrace was not appealing.

0,"I used to frequent this RA on a very regular basis and absolutely loved it. Always received great service and was seated in a timely manner even during rush time nI just went here with a girlfriend a couple of Fridays ago and it was awful. I would give it one star except Im hoping this might be a one time thing however many signs indicated it is not. nThe wait was AT LEAST  minutes long, thinking it was worth it we waited, saw some friends and they got sat at a table large enough for us all to sit together so we only waited about . We were sat outside after being told there were misters to keep us cool. the misters were about  ft high and pointing in the wrong direction so we all sat there in an uncomfortable humid state of sweat. nWe asked multiple times for extra menus and place settings and did not get them until AFTER our food was served. No soy sauce on the table had to wait for that too. My friend and I ordered sake bombers and they gave us water glasses instead of bomber glasses...they said they kept breaking so they dont provide them anymore. What kind of sushi restaurant does not have the appropriate glasses for bombers? They must be really struggling financially. nOur server was dull and unenthusiastic, no desire to please. Asked for more water and got it about  minutes later. If I wasnt enjoying the company so much I probably would have lost it and asked to speak to a manager. Server also didnt get my friends order right and so they didnt get one of the rolls they ordered until we were almost finished eating. Also they took away the mushrooms in the veggie tempura one of my fav items, big bummer for me. nWe didnt dare order desert even though we wanted it. All of us are very good tippers and we couldnt even decide if this server deserved a tip. We ended up leaving  instead of . I considered that very generous. nThere are way too many new sushi restaurants that contend with RA or are better for me to have any desire to go back again. I wouldnt be surprised if this location shut down if they keep up that quality of service."
0,"I dont really like to give a negative review after just one experience, I usually chalk that up to an off day or bad luck. But after two bad experiences in one week, well, here we are. I like the food at autmn court and have had a few good experiences with both take out and dine in but the service here has slipped exponentially. nnThe first order we placed this week was over the phone to pick up, but the person on the phone took our address and our card information, and hung up quickly  we werent sure if they were coming to deliver it or if we were still picking it up. After  minutes and no food, we drove to autmn court literally, a half a mile from our house to see if our food was there. It wasnt  turns out the driver was on their way. We waited fifteen minutes and the deliverer still hasnt arrived, so we called just to make sure there wasnt a miscommunication. Shortly after, we got a call from the driver, who was lost. My husband navigated her to our house and we finally got our food. nnThe second order we placed was placed in person, we left to grab a few items from the grocery and came back about  minutes later they told us it would be  minutes so I figured wed be all good. We waited another  minutes before our food was ready and took it home. Well, silly me didnt check my food to make sure it was correct before we left, and turns out, it wasnt. I promptly turned around and went back to fix the order. nnI told the bartender I had the wrong order. He said, oh! Your food is over there. Oh, thank you. I grabbed my bag and checked it. I had to ask if there had been a change in management, or if they had been having issues lately, and the only thing he said was that they had new people on the phones my order was placed in person, but that he had been there for twelve years. Oh, good for you, friend. He didnt offer to rectify the issue or apologize. nnThen I got home and my order was still wrong. Soup has a funny way of looking the same in dark lighting. nnI think they probably still have good dine in service, and the patrons at the bar looked happy, but I wont be ordering out from here again."
0,"I love Chipotle, but every time I eat at this location, I swear Ill never be back. The employees are so inattentive and sloppy. nnToday, I showed up right at opening time and they were scrambling around trying to finish things that shouldve been ready before opening. They didnt have brown rice. The employee said it would be  minutes until they had it. What the F is that?!  Its not like they ran out. The had just opened. Thats just poor preparation, which isnt surprising based on my previous experiences at this location. nnFrom now on Ill just drive a little further and eat at the Chipotle in San Tan Village."
0,"Talk about deja vu. This place reminds me so much of the Nugget in Reno. Its old, has bad services and theres not a lot of games or slots in the casino. Definitely not going to stay here again. Two thumbs down."
0,"Me and my boyfriend started coming here after class and wanted to do it regularly every week because of the friendly staff, delicious food,  large portions. It always seemed clean  the people who served us were always so kind. However, one experience had me thoroughly disgusted. It was an empty lobby and we grabbed our food to sit on the booth area which was unoccupied. After I finished eating, I looked to my left and next to me was a roach that just appeared since it wasnt there when we sat down. So, obviously I felt nauseous because its not a sight you want to see after you eat. We told the front cashier and his reaction surprised me. He simply said Oh ok. As if roaches are a typical issue for this restaurant. And as we grabbed our stuff while I felt like throwing up, he stood there waiting for us to move so he could get it. He didnt apologize or say it doesnt usually happen or that it wouldnt happen again. Good food, nice staff usually, but never coming back again and warned everyone else I know."
0,"Ill chime in,   Ive stayed here twice, both times in the pyramid.   Its one of the cheaper rooms on the strip, and theres a reason.   The pyramid rooms are really in need of a renovation.

0,"So, call ahead and ask if there is a balcony. Yes. Get there and it is locked off. Bullshit. Security reasons. Asked for a strip view and high floor  of  floor. Was told it had a partial strip view. Faced due west, no strip view what so ever. Called them they didnt care. The kitchenette, no dishes or utensils.  minute round trip walk thru sky tube to get a cup of coffee. Everything is located on the casino side. Not what was advertised or told to us at all. Shuttle only takes you to one place on Strip Forum shops at Ceasars. Stop running at pm. This is part of the resort fee you pay and is of little value. Internet sucks. Anyhow, you get the idea. Never, ever again and would warn friends away."
0,"A friend recommended Nourish to me since Im a healthy eater so I had high expectations and really wanted to love this place. Unfortunately, I was deeply disappointed. Not only did the restaurant have uneducated servers and misinformed nutritional tendencies catering to trendy diets not fundamental healthy eating but the food was terrible too. nnMy husband had the grassfed burger which was overprocessed, tough and potentially steamcooked  it had no browning on the surface and looked almost gray. It was on a horrible brown rice bun that was weirdly textured it had an odd mouth feel and tasted like styrofoam and was served soggy juice that should have been in the burger was all over the plate and the bun was placed directly in the middle of it. I had the grassfed beef tenderloin salad which was ok but the beef was overcooked and dry, there were some cold onions that were overwhelmingly salty and the dressing was too vinegary. The sangria wasnt good either, it was overspiced. nnThe hummus a side to the burger was quite tasty but a bit overlygarlicky and desperately needed pita and the horseradish mustard was superb. nnWe will definitely never go back."

0,"What makes this stand out is the amount of food in the stadium.  There isnt a place you can look that has no food sales in sight.  They have every type of food you want.  Although, by the looks of most people I saw in Phoenix, they dont need all that around.  The stadium was nice, but also felt kinda detached here.  There was a game on the field, but I felt like I was seperated from it.  The crowd involvement wasnt as much as even in LA.  Meh."
0,The sushi was good but the drinks are way way way too expensive. we didnt even know its that expensive and we kept ordering. too bad there is no way to contact the place via mail. i would like to get a nice refund or a gift card due to the fact that i spent more  there on drinks than last night on dinner for  !!

Saturdays were free beer night draft bud light, coors light and pbr til they gave out , of each.. again, no cover. Was always packed and played a decent variety of music pitchers for beer pong were also always dirt cheap. And despite,  the bartenders were way personable and fun.nIm not trying to sound like a cheapskate, as I am in the service industry myself.. but there mustve been a change of ownership since my prior experiences. This is all feels like a place that you would come to die. All old fogies glued to their video poker, nothing bud old, terrible country music via jukebox, versus the dj that once kept the party rockin. n I tried a little experiment tonightis with said jukebox, and put on some of my flavor music.. within seconds all the older crowded started fussing, and after a couple songs literally took my music off... really. nAlso, it seems absolutely painful for swift service. And once i finally got my cocktail, both times, the garnish was not replenished. The barmaid would much rather go on with certain guests about her hooligan daughter who is apparently gonna end up pregnant or in jail sometime soon, rather than make sure the drinks are kept full... I tend bar myself,  and the way i see it is i dont need to be encouraged to make money. Guess with the older crowd, tips must be a bit shorter than back then too, but I also dont see any familiar faces. Guess they cleaned house, bonehead move.nLong story short, i miss the old Hideaway."
0,"I came here because locals get a great discount for the buffet. Too bad you get what you pay for. nn Raw Oysters  Not fresh. They salted it to try to hide the unfreshness.

At least it was warm. nn Mash Potatoes  Was this really mash potatoes? Needed to seasoned more and actually mashed. Its mashed potatoes, not chunked potatoes. nn Pasta  This is  made to order.

This is applicable on Sundays, Monday, and Wednesday.nnThis buffet is really small compared to the bigger buffets at the strip casinos. Food is pretty bad, but Ive tasted much worse. Unless you get the locals prices, move along. Be sure to skip the raw oysters! Spend a little more at the other buffets and enjoy your meal and not get sick."
0,"This place flat out sucked. nnFirst of all, the temperature was FREEZING.  They explained that it was the casino that set the temperature of the place, but the casino was where I dreamed of being.  I was shivering the whole meal with goosebumps and my am hair standing on end.  It was uncomfortable to the point that I almost went to the shops to buy a sweater.  Hmmm, maybe that was the point? nnThe food wasnt good either.  I had the Sunday night pasta short rib sugo basically and it was not seasoned at all and had an icky taste.  Boyfriend had an Asian chicken dish that he ordered spicy, but it was sickly sweet.  nnAll in all, will not be returning.

Ive come to realize that neither of those things matter if the food is fresh and curbs my constant need for pho.nn  My relationship with blue moon ended when I the sole dining patron that afternoon was told to sit wherever as the woman who was working there could not bother to get up from her table full of food she was scarfing down to even put on menu on the table I chose to sit at.  Not a big deal...everyones gotta eat and Ive worked in enough restaurants to know that that this can be hard to fit into your work day.  I also know that Its unprofessional, against health code and not the best start to a diners experience to witness an employee eating in the dining room.  Since I had to get my own menu and I have seen the woman before I assume that perhaps she realizes I already know what I want as I often order the same thing.  I wait about  minutes for her to stop eating and come take my order when another man that works there comes in with a banner that they both proceed to stare at for a few minutes and then sit down to discuss.  Now I am getting angry and I want my damn pho.  As the next  minutes role by with me pondering over the options of breaking up with blue moon and how this will not only impact my eating habits but many other facets of my life,  I decide that I can no longer take the blatant disregard of ANY needs of the only paying customer.

Everything is under  caloriesthey dont tell you the fat grams...so they are on their way but not there yet.nnIf you have a craving for some good food and you are in this area try Settebello Pizza, The BBQ joint by GVR, or the Italian restaurant in GVR skip this place and skip China Grille."
0,"Probably one of the worst experiences I encountered at a restaurant. The hostess had a distinct attitude about her like she didnt want to be there. On top of that, she didnt greet us like she is supposed to. Also, when we asked for a booth instead of a table she rolled her eyes at us. When we ordered our food, one of us ordered soup with our meal, and once the food was brought out, the waitress brought us the wrong soup. She told us the chef said the special was different. She left the table and came back a few minutes later saying the chef was wrong and the original soup special she said it was, they actually still had. So she brought us out a cup of that soup as well, which wasnt that great after all was said and done. Also, my girlfriends chicken sandwich was supposed to be a buffalo chicken sandwich, but it was a poor excuse of one. There was no buffalo sauce on it and I have seen pieces of toast that were more moist than this sandwich. The burger I had was decent, but nothing to write home about. Oh yeah, and did I mention that my girlfriend found a bug in her water? I will not be coming back to this location. My experience at the location in Uptown Charlotte was  times better."
0,"This Subway is inside the Orleans hotelcasino, in the food court area.nI always get a veggie patty sandwich, just like a previous reviewer, and when I went to this Subway on  they also did not have the veggie patty.nGet with it, Subway manager!!!!nOrder more damn veggie patties and put them in the freezer!nnI also dont understand why they charge extra to put avocado on my completely vegetablebased sandwich. Im already skipping the meat AND the cheese...dont you think you could throw me a bit of avo? Hrrrrmmmmmph.nnOther than that, food was fresh, made quickly. Sufficient to ward off starvation."
0,"SUCK! thats what i say to myself when i think of this place. dont get me wrong, the massages are good, but what they are TOTALLY lacking is customer service. They have idiots working the front desk. My husband has a membership here because he really likes massages. I decide to make an appointment and they dont ask the gender preference question or even tell me the name of my masseuse. There was another girl at the desk who seemed to have the maturity and intellect of a  year old, gave my husband an attitude when he requested a specific gender. Anyway, so i go for my first massage and get the  rate. awesome. I go there a second time with my husband, who has a membership, as his guest. The vouchers that they gave him when he signed up was for the  rate for guests of members. When we presented the voucher to  year old she said, uMmMm, tHeSe are for FirSt TiMe GuEsTs oNLy??? Dont you love how valley girls state factual information in the form of a question? We said, well hes a member and it doesnt specifically state that on the voucher. This is why my husband got the membership in the first place, so I could get the rate too.  yearold, So ItS gOnNa Be LiKe  dOlLaRs fOr HeR??? Me, ok, can we talk to someone else? year old, I am SoRrY, ThAtS jUsT oUr PoLiCy??? Do YoU wAnNa PuRcHaSe tHe MeMbeRsHiP? ThAt wAy YoU cAn HaVe ThE  RaTe EvErY mOnTh. Why the hell would i PAY for a membership to PAY for massages? Me, um, no. I am such a wuss for not chewing  year old out. Now, not only do i not want to go back, but my husband, who had bought the membership doesnt want to go back to dumbass  year old. Total waste."
0,"I am so pissed off, placed a TOGO order on phone, for Chicago style Large Cheese Pizza. I was told to collect the Pizza in  mins. I went there after  mins and guess what, my order is not in the system. nnShe asked me If I can wait for another  mins, she started to place the order in the system, and the system showed Pizza to b .xx, but their online menu has the same Pizza for .xx, I asked her to Not put  Topping Large Pizza, and just put Cheese large Pizza. BUT SHE DIDNT GET IT... I got pissed off and came back home. nI am not planning to go their again."
0,"I had  and a half hours to kill so Im glad that the airport had a bar with draft beer.  The food didnt look too great the person next to me was eating tacos but it had a weird smell to it.. like old meat.  Im glad I wasnt hungry.. haha.  nnI sat at the bar, which was pretty full and ordered a few Draft Stellas.  The beer was good and the bartender was nice.  He informed me that we are allowed to walk around with our beers in the airport terminal which was awesome.  I had the bartender put my last beer in a plastic cup so I could walk around.  Each beer was about , kinda pricey but its an airport so I wasnt trippin."
0,"Where do I start? So tonight is my birthday and me and some friends went to Kobe for a fun filled dinner before we began our night, well that was ruined with this experience.nnThe dinner started off by not getting a chef to our table for over  minutes! I felt my night was already ruined, but chef Taylor was a blast and made it quite enjoyable. The food was delicious and prepared exactly how I wanted it. So we then ate our food and asked our server Ana for our bill. nnHere is where all hell broke loose, in the course of  minutes and  different attempts to bring us the prober bills I finally had to request a manager. A young lady came out and labeled herself as a half server whatever that is. Asked what was the matter. I then explained and she stated she would take care of it. Her taking care of it was a  discount. I felt so insulted, not only did I have to cancel my birthday plans but they felt my time and frustration was only worth . nnThanks Kobe for ruining my birthday plans."
0,Yuck food is greasy service stunk! I ordered a Philly sand which to find out they were out! Ordered French onion soup was way too salty. Mozzarella sticks ok but defiantly greasy! Waited  minutes for our check as we were told our server was busy. Needs a good cleaning also
0,"I was recommended this by a new friend in town. I just moved here and I wanted some authentic southern BBQ. Almost everyone Ive met so far has laughed at the thought of real southern BBQ in Charlotte. nnThe ribs werent good. Tough, overdone. Better ribs up north. Im sure sandwiches and appetizers here are better.nnNow, the baked beans...Amazing. So. Damn. Good. If Im walking in the area, Id probably swing by Midwood Smokehouse for just a side order of the baked beans. Its just dank."
0,"The one star I gave is strictly for the kind waitress who took our order.  Otherwise,what an experience.  I took my sister to Mimis on Bell road yesterday.  I was told it would be  minutes before we got seated  It was  pm and there was hardly anyone there!  I asked to sit in the main room and mentioned nobodys in there...I was told, theyre starting to fill it up now.  Finally after being seated, we ordered the same thing  the Mozzarella and tomato salad. The salads came with a honey muffin.  The service was excellent  attentive and caring.  Kudos to the kind lady who waited on us.  Within  hours after returning home, I became violently ill.  I got the chills and started to shake so badly. And then, the nausea and vomiting started  lasting until almost midnight.  I also ran a  fever.  I called my sister this morning and asked her if she had gotten sick.  YES, she had!  Coincidence?  I dont think so.  I called the restaurant this morning and was given to the District Manager.  I dont believe he could have cared less.  He told me nobody else got sick from that meal yesterday  I said, well, my sister and I did ... silence from this man.  While we were eating, there was no one left in the restaurant.  He asked me how soon after we ate did we experience symptoms. I replied hours.  He came back with well, if it was food poisoning, that usually takes  hours.  Since I had the food poisoning website pulled up on my computer  it shows that anywhere from  hours after you eat, you experience the symptoms of food poisoning.  Again, silence. I asked what is the recourse, he said hed file a claim and Id probably be hearing from someone from corporate.  No Im sorry, you got sick, or I hope you come back or anything that remotely resembled compassion. nNeedless to say, I will never return nor bring guests to that Mimis again."
0,"I was so looking forward to breakfast here. What a disappointment.nnThe food is the only thing that rates any stars at all. Good ingredients cannot be completely ruined by incompetent service.nnThe space is nice, but crowded and loud. The counter staff were indifferent. After being waved over to an open register, the fellow behind the counter took one order, then wandered off, leaving the rest of us to get back in line at the other register to order.nnYou are given a number or not and left to find your own table, scrounge up your own silverware, and wait for your food to be delivered. Except that the napkins are at a completely different station than the silver, they were out of forks, and most of the tables were completely filthy. I watched a busboy randomly swipe the top of a table, sweeping crumbs onto the benches and chairs, then leave an empty drink bottle on the table before wandering listlessly off.nnBeverages are apparently serve yourself, although they didnt bother to say that when I ordered. I stood at the counter, waiting for iced tea, only to turn around and see that I was expected to get it myself.nnIf they happen to run out of numbers, then they input your name with your order. Nothing irritates me more than to have my name shouted across a restaurant. Better yet, the waiters wander from table to table looking for their customers.... Lisa? Is there a Lisa here? while your food cools. Inexcusable.nnThe only bright point the croque madame was tasty. Delicious bread, ham, and a perfectly fried egg. But the meager smear of bechamel and a thin slice of cheese were underwhelming. However, the side of fruit made me angry a tiny metal creamer with  blackberry, a few slices of strawberry, and  chunks of  green apple. Insulting.nnFast casual, order at the counter works well when tables are clean and set, and the food delivery is speedy and efficient. Unfortunately this place needs some work in order to make it worth your time."
0,"Went there for the first time today.  I found the staff to be available and attentive.  It was around  and very few tables were full. nnI ordered a greek salad, without the chicken.  It was good, but small.  When I got the check it was for the full amount of the salad with chicken and it was .!!  I inquired about the pricing since I did not have the chicken and the reply from the waitress and the hostess was, that is the price either way.  Okay, I get that, but it was not a lot of salad and for the price I felt it was too much.  nnI order things all the time without meat and usually the price is adjusted reflecting the lack of meat. nnOh well, just so so and had to go home and forage some more, as I was still hungry.nnProbably wont go back."
0,I visited the Walmart on Thunderbird in El Mirage after  pm I picked out the items that I wanted to purchase and then went to the front and began to get in line when I realize there were  about  people standing in line and only one checkstand open I glanced around and saw three or four what looked to be supervisor standing around having a great conversation but none of them are willing to jump in an open another line up so I chose to abandon my cart and go to another store I wont be visiting this Walmart again
0,"Seriously worst hotel I have ever stayed at.  Our experience upon arrival set the stage for an awful stay at this hotel.  First we were greeted by an unpleasant bell hop who rudely told us that we were not able to bring in our coolers.  I politely told him I disagreed and carried them to my room anyways.  It would have been one thing if he was nice about the rule, but the way he was so rude about it rubbed me the wrong way.  Then next we had called ahead to see what time check in was.  They said it would be at .  We arrived at  and the lady rudely told us our room was not ready and that check in was from  and therefore we could come back at .  We get to our room, there were only two sets of towels and we had three girls staying in our room.  We called for towels and two hours later they still hadnt showed up.  We called again and finally we received two more towels.  SO glad they could spare only TWO.  I would never stay here again and am so disgusted with the way we were treated that I had to write a negative review."
0,"Like Thom below, I dont like giving bad reviews either, but you have to be warned. Going to give this place two stars, because the gal behind the counter was very nice. Even gave me a free sample of deep fried oyster. The place was clean and comfortable for what it is.  On the other hand, I had better fish from Gortons. Yes, the frozen kind you get in the grocery store. Also ordered shrimp. Looked good, but it was  breading. Maybe the burgers or sandwiches are better but Ill never know. Wont be going back."
0,"Came here on a Thursday night, a sign clearly says, wait to be seated...no one came and no one acknowledged we were there waiting at leaste  minutes... I went to a waitress about being seated like the sign said she said sure sit in there...looks like the remnants of a Thursday Night Happy Hour during a football game with crappy cold food. We just left...disappointed i am sure no one was going to help us, since it looked understaffed and the staff seem to blend in with the customers...so who really knows.  Too bad, had the potential to be a local hang out spot for us, but was not welcoming AT ALL!  Surprised at all the good reviews..."
0,"Went through the drive thru. They asked me to wait, so i waited minutes until my bf asked them if they were ready to take our order. they apologized and took our order. We got to the window we waited  min when they finally came up to us but they asked again what our order was!! We asked for a water also. Then they came back gave us out order but forgot our water. Waited another  min and we finally got our water. I dont know how this place is still open. Ah probably cuz its the only KFC here in ahwatukee. I dont usually do this but Im sorry you guys deserve bad reviews. COME ON GUYS!!!"
0,"Got a cup of coffee and came here to study, on my way in I was stopped and asked to leave my drink on a table up front. Are you serious, an adult cannot enjoy a cup of coffee while studying? You want me to leave it so itll be inconvenient for a sip and for it to possibly get tampered with? NO THANK YOU. Walked straight out and will never step in again, there are way more options out there to put up with that."
0,First of all when we checked in to our room the door didnt lock the lock was apparently broken. Really? Ugh I had to go downstairs and complain and asked the front desk to give us a different room. So inconvenient we had to carry our stuff to a different room. nnI had to ask them for and upgrade for the inconvenience. Room service is bad they charge for everything  for a robe per day  for a refrigerator. This was the first and last time I will stay At New York New York. Btw the rooms are old fashioned and creepy .
0,"My office came here for a park outing and I was not very impressed at all. nnWhere to begin?!?!? My mom always says to start with the good...so here goes there was ample parking for all of us. Yep. Thats as good as it gets. nnThe lakepond was very dirty, the trails and grass were covered with doggie fertilizer and the bathrooms were just bad. Oh, and getting out of the park was a bit of a nightmare...Ugh! nnThis place was just not for me. Not returning anytime soon."
0,I called four times last night to place a togo order pp and got their recording each time.  Either this place is SO busy they cant get to the phone or they had closed up early and went home.  nnIm still craving Thai...and looking for a great place in Central Phoenix.  Any other suggestions or should I give this place another chance?
0,"Really overpriced food! I really wouldnt mind the prices if the food was worth it, but my Brick Chicken was too dry and seriously wasnt worth  dollars. The portion for that thing was too small. nnGo somewhere else to get better food in Vegas. Even when the place was empty the food took forever to come out!"
0,"I have been coming to this place for over  years now but, it has gone down hill as far as service. Summary the food is fair, the price is good, the service is poor after pm when night shift takes over, multiple times waiting  minutes to get a menu when the place is completely dead... Probably wont be coming back any more considering."
0,"Very friendly staff!, but this review only applies to the food, since we got  it to go.  Pretty boring order consisting of a california roll, a spicy tuna roll, and a squid salad  so it should have been hard to screw up, right?.  The California roll, was just crab and cucumber....no avocado, which was really odd to me. It wasnt bad, just missing avocado. Rice is a good consistency. The spicy tuna was rancid....gross, plus I paid . for something I couldnt eat. And then the squid salad tasted off....and this is something I eat for lunch at least twice a week from this little japanese market, so I know my squid salad.  We ended up throwing everything out. Its obvious our first time will be our last."
0,"TERRIBLE.  I have stayed here a few times and my room was upgraded  to Manaco Tower  its what I payed for anyways and this time they SCREWED UP and did NOT give me the room I paid for. They gave me a SMOKINGI dont smoke and specifically asked for no smoking and gave me in the old towers. nWhat can I say. These rooms suck. The new towers are OK. But these are horrific. Mold in the bathroom, bath tub is filthy, and the mattresses are extremely uncomfortable. I complained to manager  ANNETTE and she was rude and acted like she doesnt care. What kind of service is that. I mean I would get better service at motel  Im sure. nEither way they lost a continuing customer and will not ever return here, even for a free room. nSave yourself the trouble and DO NOT stay here!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
0,"This place is right outside of my work so I pass by it all the time. Theres Chipotle right next to it  the only Chipotle in town if I remember correctly, and I always go straight to Chipotle in stead of this place. nnAnd you know what, after trying Mr. Ks today, I will continue to choose Chipotle over Mr. Ks.nnI order the Big Ks burger and Homemade onion rings. The food is not anything special, definitely not as good as Five Guys. Beef patty tasted bland and without condiments I wouldnt able to push it down to my stomach. Onion rings is a little overfried, and overpriced more expensive than a beef burger? and only has  rings in it? really?. nnI see this place probably is recognized for its sentimental value and not really the food."
0,"I have to rate this location a . Service was mediocre server was unattentive, all over the place, rude, and even had personal conversations with her coworker on the other side of the room, location is ridiculous have to make a left turn and circle the plaza just to get to the parking, food was terrible bland, felt plastic, and the birthday dessert we had for my boyfriends birthday was ROCK solid. Ive never had a chocolate dessert where it took a knife to cut through and not to mention the fact that all the servers were yelling at the cook. nnIve had better service before but this particular time was just terrible. I dont think Ill be visiting again or any time soon. I was hoping I would receive the best of the best considering the many good reviews but I guess you have to come in at a good time to receive exceptional service. Nonetheless, it was ok."
0,Ahhh Sams Club. Not my first choice for warehouse shopping but they do have things that the other club doesnt. My biggest complaint is that customer service is seriously lacking at this location.nnPro tip... You dont have to be a member to shop here. Jump on their website and print out a oneday pass. Be aware... they will tack on a  service fee.
0,"The big pro is the location in Campus Town. Most nights they also have food specials and the bar is usually very clean and service is fine. nnThe  big con is the food. I have eaten here several times and the food is just simply bland, mediocre bar food which is overpriced. This seems like another place that hustles the students with little value for the money."
0,"Deplorable customer service. I lost my bag flying on their tiny aircraft from El Paso to Monterey. The agent tells me to taxi my bag but not to take the stub from the tag or to pick it up at my next destination in Phoenix. By the time I realized my bag was missing, I was in Monterey. Ive made every effort to find my bag, but theyve made no attempt to look for it. When I called the Phoenix office the lady was extremely rude and practically hung up on me after telling me it was not her problem and to check with my final destination. Not to mention the flights were small, cramped and extremely uncomfortable. Ill never fly with them again. Ill drive if I have to. At least that way I can account for my things better. if there was a rating lower than  star I would give it."
0,"I hate cats.  I like most other animals, but I hate cats.  Theyre anitsocial, they scratch anyone who comes within a ten metre radius of them and they only give their owners any affection when they want fed.  Unfortunately, Dofos is full of these violent, twofaced gits who are just prowling about the place like theyre something special.  nFurther, there seem to be cages all over the place with emaciated, bored parrots in them who dont want to play ball with the talking thing.  They do, however, have plenty of pet food, accessories, cages and even medicines for animal ailments.  I havent had a pet since my rabbit died in  RIP Smokey, but if I did I probably wouldnt come here for the pet food.  The prices are reasonable and they have a good range of products, but the cats just do my head in!"
0,"If I could it would be  Stars. This place is the most horrific club ever in Vegas. Why is it in Vegas?! Its so unclean, ghetto, and a big nono! Checked this place out this past week for the first time just because I wanted to try a new club in Vegas. I think ill just stick to Marquee, Hakkasan and all the clubs that are considered to be Vegas clubs!"
0,"Horrible and awful are not strong enough words. I have taken my work trucks here a few times due to some groupon coupons, but never again. I took my s in a couple weeks ago. They fixed the seals and said that would fix it.  months later Im still going through a quarter of oil per week. Took the day off work yesterday just to get my truck fixed. Dropped it off at am. Arrogant guy behind the counter asked what if I cant get it back to you until Monday. I told him that Id have to go somewhere else because work starts at am Monday. He said no problem, hed give me a call shortly. I called at  and he said he was going to look at it in the morning. I reminded him of our conversation and he said oh yeah. I then asked if they could do it now and they said no, they close in mins, which means I wasnt even going to get a phone call before they closed. nnWhen I went in same arrogant guy behind the counter never apologized and said when I bring it back in hell waive the  diagnostic fee. Give me a break, too arrogant to even apologize. DO NOT GO HERE!!!"
0,"I went to this salon yesterday to get my eyebrow cleaned up. They waxed my eyebrows to clean up the area, but they did not bothered to trim my hair. In their menu, it specifically said  for eyebrow clean up hair trimming.  How can you have this on menu, but not do the job. I basically paid for a half ass job. In addition, they also got a little wax on my hair."
0,"We were visiting from out of town and this place was recommended as authentic mexican food.  Well, its not authentic Mexican food, but authentic old fashioned texmex. Old Lounge style atmosphere, kind of tired, but service was good. Our food came out immediately, which tells me that it was just sitting in the kitchen waiting to be plated.  My husband ordered the chili relleno, which was basically a egg omelet with a poblano pepper inside, not fried in a batter and no cheese on top thats what were used to.  I ordered the enchilada  tamale combo plate.  Tamale was ok, but the enchiladas were.... something else.  The tortilla was kind of tough the cheese seemed tough too  Maybe it wasnt just melted enough. Everything was just glooped on the plate together. Anyway, this place might be ok if you live around the corner and everybody knows your name, but if youre going out for a meal that counts then skip it.  Theres just too many other good choices out there."
0,"Its alright but I would rather visit other establishments at Tempe Marketplace.  I dont even know where to start with the service.  Usually the service sucks and no one pays attention to you.  Or the server is in a hurry to get out.  The last time I paid a visit to this place was after the movies.  I wanted to get some drinks with friends and maybe some foods.  The server was attentive to the point where she was trying to rush us out.  She finally told us that she was done for the night and wanted us to cash out.  We wanted to continue drinking but this girl ended our night at Cadillac and we took our business else where.  I have worked in the restaurant business before and I know you can transfer tables to another server without driving the customer away.  I have never had a good experience when I come here.  When I do stop for a visit, my expectations are very low."
0,"A friend that lives in the Downtown area wanted to meet here for coffee  chat. Its one of his fave spots. He reminded me over and over, Its very hipster!  Uhhh...Yeah, OK. Coffee was blah. Staff werent all that friendly. Comfy chairs  Yes..but theres no reason to return."
0,"This place has certainly changed alot, they use to have the best caesar salad and on our visit this past saturday, not so good, barely had any dressing on it.  Service was also very poor, I understand they are very very busy but we waited a very long time to get our bread.  Our waiter had not help from his busser.nnI dont like how you can no longer order small and large, food quality has definately gone down."
0,"Well, this is one of those ratings that I wish I could give an extra  star on, because a star can be deceiving.nnThis place is very well decorated, and the personality of the servers is very friendly.nnThe only problem is the food.nnI dont really care how good the service is, or how fun the atmosphere is, if a restaurant doesnt have good food, most other categories dont matter.nnThe Pomegranate tea I had tasted very watered down, and the Firecracker chicken I had which was highly recommended by the waitress tasted a lot like a frozen dinner over mildly overdone rice. The sauce was bland, and the chicken was dry and tasteless.nnIt might pass for somebody unfamiliar with Asian food.nnI was pretty surprised, because the shrimp appetizer we had was VERY tasty.nnToo bad. I dont expect Ill be back unless my coworkers outnumber me."
0,"My husband and I came into this store on Saturday to upgrade our phones and to add him to my plan.

I was told I just need to bring my marriage license into a STORE, and they could change it there. Um, I was just told in the store that I couldnt change my name there, but I guess that was a lie.nnThe woman I dealt with clearly had no desire to help me. Its fine if you dont know the answer to something, but at least make the effort to find it out! I dont understand people that work in customer service, and totally lack it at the same time, isnt this your job?nnCongrats for earning my first  star review!nnIf you need to go to a Verizon store, drive the  miles to the other one on th and Thomas where they actually will help you."
0,"Umm.. here we go. It was a nice restaurant to sit down with the family and enjoy a good meal. The food was great, everything went well.. but our waiter didnt seem too happy about taking our orders or even working. He looked so annoyed and was rushing our orders.

0,"My daughter, granddaughter and I shopped at your Kierland store about  minutes ago. It was a shopping experience much below our expectations of J Crew. n The wait time to check out was atrociously longn My daughter was approached by a male employee who asked her if she needed any help. When she asked a question his response was I dont know but I will find out when I get a chance. WHAT? Why would you offer to help when you are unable to help?n We bought  items. After exiting the store we discovered that the one of the items had not been reduced by the  percent off. Went back in and the wait started all over again. Apparently the discount did not apply to the item in question. The employee missed the opportunity to make a recovery by not offering to apply the discount anyway  a grand amount of .. Are you kidding me? You spend millions on marketing and then miss an opportunity like this to make a favorable impression. nMickey you are a great merchant. You need an equally good good operator. nCheers!"
0,"Absolutely awful. There are no Sonics anywhere close to where I live, so when we got the chance to visit one when I went to Las Vegas, I was looking forward to it.nnHowever, I hate the fact that you cant walk into the place...I get it, its a drivein...but absolutely NO option to go inside?! Kind of silly in my opinion.nnGetting to the food...nothing special. I would have rather have gone to In n Out.nnOverall, generic experience, eh food, and awful atmosphere. I dont recommend this place...especially if you have a hangover."
0,"I totally didnt get it, and never found any of it funny. nnThe whole thing was just stupid and put me and my friend in a blah mood so it was hard to get motivated to go out afterwards. nnTalk to people who are similar, your friends and then see if you should go."
0,"This place is GROSS!!! My wife  I recently stayed there during a lil date night venture on the strip what we found in our room was disgusting. Brown stains on the sheets  hand towel under the blankets on the bed, busted sink handles, snot on the wall in the bathroom, nasty stuff. I wrote them a little courtesy email informing them of our stay  told them we probably wouldnt be back again, they sent one back saying they would give us an upgrade on our next stay. WTF were not coming back with all the resorts on the strip why would we ever come back to that mess!"
0,"We sent back  dishes and decided not to order anything else. My entire mouth was assaulted by salt. nnWe tried the West Indies Chicken Curry rice bowl and it was so aggressively salted, we sent it back after  bites and then selected the Jerk Chicken Pasta. Unfortunately, that was also crazy salty I couldnt get another bite in, my tastebuds and mouth were completely ruined and shriveled up.nnThe flavor profile of each dish was also shockingly basic  It didnt offer up any of the Caribbean flavors or seasonings that were promised. The Jamaican jerked chicken was dried out and I didnt even taste much jerk seasoning  only salt. To be fair, the dinner entree portions were gigantic. One dish is perfect for  people to share. nnAlso, the appetizers were average. We tried the chicken empanadas and they were extremely doughy with minimal filling. The only dish that was decent was the fried coconut shrimp appetizer, however, I have to explicitly state that Elephant Bar and YardHouse makes it better. nnThe manager came to talk to us at the end and was very defensive about the salt usage in both dishes. He also offended us by suggesting that we probably didnt know what jerk seasoning tasted like. lol. Im not even going to argue it. We ended up heading to InNOut and grabbing some burgers after this failed dinner."

I guess it was a lil stupid of me to think that theyd never make it to the superbowl in my lifetime. nnSo theyre going to the big Bowl... whoo hoo... i guess... but dude, seriously... where the HELL was this LAST YEAR?!?! Yeah... last year!! When the superbowl was in ARIZONA!! DUH!! How awesome would that have been?! AZ goes to the superbowl in AZ!! Talk about economical boost! But alas, the big game is all the way in Tampa Bay... I unno if many of the cardinal fans will be making it, but for a once in a lifetime event like this... you never know.nneven though I HATE football... and I am comfortable with hating the Cardinals and decades long suckfest.... its nice to see the ultimate underdogs finally have their day. Sure they suck, sure theyve been the worst team in history... but like so many things in America... We are about to experience a change. Now... if I can only allude my old high school bookie for a few weeks until I have enough to make good on my bet!!"
0,"Horrible customer service. Me and my girlfriend went their for the first time and, it will he the last. The place was not busy at all for a weekend night and thought it would be a good place to have a quick drink. After waiting at the bar for a few minutes which is normal the female bartender came up and asked us what we wanted. My friend asked a question about the ping pong tables they had, she abruptly answered her and then walked away without taking our order. The bartended then proceeded to service the men at the bar asking if they were ok and if they ended anything else.We tried to get her attention because we were ready to order but she never came back to us or even looked our way! We both stood there confused because we were ready to order and just because we asked a question before we order didnt give her the right to completely disregard us as customers. I dont know if it was because we were female and she didnt think she would get a good tip from us or if she just wanted the mens attention. Who knows! I will never go back to that bar and will not hesitate to let my friends know about the bad customer service either."
0,"I was disappointed by the small cramped rooms of this librarys floorplan, which is more labyrinth than welcoming civic space. The poor layout and arcane catalogue system make it tough to find the sections of books youre looking for.  nnFor a city the size of Vegas, I just expected and hoped for more in a main library.  This claustrophobic pink warehouse does not belong in the same league as any major east coast or California library.  Borders or Barnes and Noble are cleaner and make it easier to find the books youre interested in, while giving you the opportunity to have a coffee and read and not be asked for spare change."
0,"Sorry fellow Yelpers. Youre wrong! Del Frisco is not the best steak restaurant in Las Vegas. Im not sure its even in the top five. The staff work hard, God Bless Them, but the kitchen is on autopilot uninteresting cuts of meat, cooked blandly, seasoned blandly....and there are no fries on the menu...how in Gods name is that possible? Im now going to do a tour of the serious steak joints in Las Vegas because any community that thinks Del Friscos and Delmonicos are restaurants that communicate with the Steak Angels needs some clarity. Perhaps it has something to do with the prefix del, I dont know, but neither of these places is that good. The word tired comes to mind."
0,"I went  here while visiting from the Bay area with my boyfirend and his borther....we wanted some bomb bbq and figured Arizona should have some good places,,,,or at least decent... We came to big Earls super hungry ready to chomp on some good ol bbq.. We came,sat down looked at the menu,ordered then looked up the reviews on Yelp....damn we should have done that first... We all ordered the ribless combo for ............................................... Man were we all bummed when we tasted our food....it was pale and soooooo dry and had a lot of fat. We tried dousing the meat with the bbq sauce to make it less dry but the bbq sauce is so terrible that it makes it worse...  We each had briskit,hot links, pulled chicken, and pulled pork...we spent . and, in the end  took it as acomplete loss...we left about  of our food. Weve eaten bbq from all over the country and have come across a few not so good ones but when corn bread is the only thing that saves you from stravation at a bbq spot when theres a huge plate of meat in front of you...theres an issue.. Dont go there........... Seriously... Its bad... Quite disappointing,...."
0,"The only positive thing I can say about this place is that it has a decent selection of beers. The service ed okay, the layout is very congested I couldnt even get into my seat without bumping into other diners. The food was mediocre at best. Very bland without even a hint of seasoning, seems to cater to American tourists."
0,"First of all, if you do not smoke do not even consider the smoking optional floor. Our room smelled like the inside of a coal miners sock. nnThey moved us to a nicer room which was ok, the young lady at the desk, Amber I think, was very sweet and helpful. nnThe bar inside the Paris, not sure of the name just look for the empty bar, has the honor of having made two of the worst drinks I have ever tried, and they were quite a bit more expensive than other nicer bars. nnWe moved to the Mandalay Bay so all is well. Dont go to the Paris."
0,"Im pissed. nWent for a prerelease screening, as Ive done at this location before, and it was SO unbelievably poorly set up!nnI arrived as I usually do, with more than enough time to spare. The line was made OUTSIDE  degrees, thanks! and went all the way around the corner of the theater, wrapped back around, past the elevators, past the trees, and up across the main front steps. nFine enough, those who are unemployed were allowed to loiter in front of the theater all day and formed a line at pm for a pm movie ugh, so I figured if we werent getting in, we werent getting in. Disappointing, but not a big deal.. I took the risk and stayed because I watched as more people continued to show up and no one turned them away. nnWith that said, I have a HUGE issue with the following...nnThey had a specific amount of tickets READY TO HAND OUT. They could have easily given them out and let the rest of us go home! At the very least, they could have done that after the hour and a half we spent in line, once it got slightly shorter.nnSeriously. Its not a difficult concept. Got  tickets in your hand? Count out  people to give tickets to. I just dont understand why they kept us waiting for absolutely no reason. And with NO explanation at any point... nThey had three employees collecting the tickets we printed at home and it was completely unnecessary....one was handing out the theater passes and two females just stood there sweating. Uh, k? nBy pm, there was absolutely no end in sight, so we left.... which probably means they screwed something up and were behind schedule. Thanks for wasting my time!"
0,"Mediocre is the best I can say.  Had a wonderful time catching up with an old friend, but the food sure didnt cut it.  Very attentive staff, let us linger  talk with no problem.  Expected a more refined level of service at a place like this, but can tell its a corporate thing  not the server at all!nnFood, only average. Ex foodie here, so I have a general clue.  Hmmm, high end steak house..... anyone there know how to cook a steak???  RareMed Rare came out medium at best, both me  my dining partner.  French onion soup, darn wish they didnt open a can with this one.  Lyonnaise potatoes, yeck!  I sure expect a lot more at  a pop.  Texas Roadhouse or Logans beat this anyday.... price and quality."
0,"After tonight, f del taco! First of all, the workers were acting sketchy right off the bat.. After buying my meal, i get half way through when i bite into a nice big piece of hair! So i call the location about  times, no voicemail available or anything, probably shaving someones head for the next person who orders some food.. I will never go to this place again"
0,"I stayed  nights  days at the Grand Desert. Checking in the gentleman at the front desk was very nice and welcoming. I stayed in  joined suites and it was more then I expected. Huge beds, a big jacuzzi tub and full kitchen. The pools were nice and clean and great for sun bathing. Everyone had a friendly smile on their face and even the security guards were extremely welcoming. nnMy main complaint I had about this establishment was during their pool side trivia contest. My large group of friends were sunbathing in the grassy area when we were asked to join a guess that song type of trivia contest. Seeing that our group is well versed in a wide variety of music genres and being trivia enthusiast we thought this might be a fun way to win a free drink. After dominating the first few questions we started to become a little more competitive. nnAfter a few minutes of playing the woman in charge of the pool side activities played a well known song, Stuck in the middle with you most notably known in the sound track of director Quentin Tarantinos Reservoir Dogs Our team quickly answered saying Stuck in the middle with you was song by the band Stealers Wheel. The woman in charged said we were wrong and allowed us a second guess. We replied with Gerry Rafferty the songwriter she once again said we were incorrect. Confused we waited for another group to answer and no one did. The woman in charge of the festivities said it was a song made famous by Bob Dylan. This was  wrong. nnWhile the vocals have a unique sound it is just not Bob Dylan. Now the majority of our group being fans of Classic rock and more specifically Bob Dylan we were sure in our answer. A separate team even went up to the woman in charge of pool side activities and showed proof that it is in fact Stealers Wheel NOT Bob Dylan who sang the song. The woman in charge of pool side activities was insistent she was correct, NOT because she had an extensive knowledge of Bob Dylans work like my team and ever growing group of supporters but because its what her Ipod said. nnNow I will be the first to admit I have music mislabeled in my ipod. It is not a fact I am proud of but its true. I suggest that the woman who is in charge of pool side activities and lounge singing to start buying her music legal through itunes, amazon, or various of the mp downloading site so it will be properly labeled and avoid illegally downloading music to avoid this type of mix up in the end. nIf youre in charge of trivia make sure you have the correct answers. nnAll in all it was a great trip and the resort was fantastic. I just hope if I end up revisiting the Grand Desert they will have the correct answers for any trivia contest they have, be in pool side or where ever.nnnwww.youtube.comwatch?vDohRalsxQ"

0,"I went to this place thinking it was another place and they were very rude. A waitress started to talk to me in Spanish and I told her sorry I didnt understand she laughed and went to find someone else. So about after minutes another woman came out and asked me what I wanted. I told her I ordered over the phone and she began arguing with me, which I responded with that sorry maybe I got the wrong place. She asked me what I ordered I told her and she told me that they dont sell that there. I apologized and she was very rude. I was leaving and in Spanish she told me to hurry up. Also to add to the rudeness of their employees to a potential customer they had a good bit of flies flying around their restaurant. I probably would have thought about trying this place at some point since I enjoy trying new places. But after my experience with the ridiculously poor customer service and which seems to be possible non sanitary conditions I want to warn as many people as I can away from this place."
0,"This is my first hotel review. nnI will never stay at Trump International again. nnWe stayed in a beautiful modern suite on the th floor.  The room was amazing! The bathroom, awesome.. especially the tub!  However, the suite we were in ... the sheets were dirty and the towels were dirty...the light bulb was out, the tv was out, the iron didnt work, the cabinet hinge was broken, the coffee pot filter was dirty  even after  times of putting the water through....  but all of that i can let slide... nnThe worst part about staying here was the noise at night.. no not noise from your neighbors.. It appears that Donald did not have his hotel sound proofed so even on the th floor you can hear the train down the street, sirens and cars... not to mention that the trains blow their horn  times when passing by... A train goes by every  hours or so, so good luck sleeping at night.. even my ear plugs did not work...  nnoverall, it is a beautiful looking hotel with a great addition that there is no casino and night life. its quiet and you dont have to breathe in second hand smoke... but our room experience was so bad that we will never stay here again."
0,"I have been in this place several times and have had mixed experience. The service here is not so great. I had a question about a video game for my nephew and I felt like I was putting the clerk off by asking questions. The store was a bit disorganized, but I would expect that for a Saturday afternoon."
0,"This Dunkin Donuts is very convenient for me to go to, however it is not very clean and it is not run very well. Every time I go for coffee I get the wrong order. Then when it needs to be fixed I get attitude. I would rather drive  minutes out of my way to Gilbert and Lindsay for better service than come back to this location. They need new managers. Someone should help this Dunkin Donuts."
0,"I am so sad that this place was nothing like I had hoped.  The husband had informed me that PHX was going to be getting a candy store and my eyes lit up and I began dreaming of all my candy adventures I would soon be having.  We stopped by this morning and I was so excited to see what kind of vintageold school candy they would have.  Instead I was inundated with novelties and kiddie toys.  When I turned around I checked out the pretty small selection of candies.  There werent a lot to choose from and a lot of them were licorice.  The prices seemed a little much to me.  Instead of advertising sweetstreatsnovelty it should really say noveltykiddie stuffsome candy.  I am just really hoping that they are just testing the waters right now and seeing what works and what doesnt so I will be back in a while.  For now, I am sadly unimpressed."
0,"Ive always liked the Border Grill in Los Angeles, so I thought Id take my family to the one in Las Vegas while we were there recently. Its cute, and the food is decent enough. But the service is not nearly as good as the one in L.A. We had two vegetarians in the group who absolutely couldnt eat onionswhich eliminates  of the menuand the server did not offer to see what he could do to accommodate. Just kind of shrugged and said, Sorry. Midway through dinner, our table of six was forgotten about. No refills on tea or other drinks. We had to really work to get dessert. All in all, definitely not worth the price for this kind of service. Wouldnt return."
0,"This place is fairly new and the decor shows how clean it is.  But it doesnt give me the HotPot vibe.  It  was pretty empty when I went there for dinner and its a Southeast Asian decor.  And I thought Hot Pot is mainly a Chinese thing.  nnI had the Ying Yang pot spicy and plain on the two sides of the pot.  The pork broth produces a strong flavor for the soup.  All the spices in the two sides made the base very strong and flavorful.  Actually it almost seemed a bit too heavy for my taste. And the spicy side is very spicy at least to me.  For the additional sauces they had their own version of soy sauce and a peanut sauce.  It was a bit sweet for my taste, so I didnt use it that much.  But the meat and vegetables dipped in the broth was definitely enough for flavor.  The napa especially soaked up the spicy broth very nicely.  I like drinking the broth after the meal to relax my stomach, but the strong broth is more like a starter soup instead of an ending soup.nnWe had the shabu beef and lamb.  They were sliced thinly, but the meat just didnt seem as tender as I would like it.  And the portions were very very small.  The presentationdishes were very nice, but the food quality just isnt there.nnIf you like strong broth flavors, then you can try this place.  But honestly, as far as Hot Pot goes, this place is very expensive with very little portions.  For the price we paid, we could have gone to Texas Roadhouse for a prime rib.  The food provided is about average as well.  If you cant travel to California and you have a craving Hot Pot, then I guess this is the only alternative.  But it may be better and cheaper if you just set it up at home."
0,"I visited the Office today and was surprised that they are not the same as The Office in Desert Ridge area. The menu was totally different. Overall, was not pleased with the food, my burger was not as good as I thought it would be. Their fries consisted of regular fries and sweet potato fries, the sweet potato fries were good. My side Caesar salad was drenched in dressing. Food came out fast for a busy NFL Sunday afternoon. nnKID FRIENDLY Kind of, They had the typical kids menu wdrink included. No crayons or paper for kids to color. nnRETURN VISIT No"
0,"Maybe this hotel was just not the right choice for our film crew to stay at after a long day of shooting but having to walk through a night club to get to our hotel room was not even slightly amusing. nnThe front desk person just casually pointed that way which seemed to say to go back outside  though the night club but when the security guards didnt know what we were talking about it also seemed ludicrous to us. nnFinally up in the room, its fine, nothing special... Except for the club music vibrating  pulsating all the way up to the th floor. Oh but I forgot that at least the front desk person offered earplugs since the music goes til am. nnGood luck sleeping here... But thats probably not what you came to Vegas for."
0,"This review is based on having the lunch buffet which is available on weekdays for .. Long story short, I wouldnt recommend this place for lunch or for the buffet because not only was the food meh but the service was horrendous.nnWhen we got there, the host asked how many were in our party to be seated. We told them that our friends were already here and asked if they minded if we took a quick peek around the corner to see if they were seated already. The host said no problem and we walked past him. After looking for about  seconds, he walks back in front of us and says maybe theyre not here yet, as if to call us liars and try to seat us anyways. We walked back towards to entrance to call our friends to see where they were. The host follows us around the whole time as if were not allowed to walk freely in the lobby. He continued to challenge us even after I told him nicely that our friends had texted us that they were seated somewhere inside before we even walked in. We eventually found our party, which had been seated towards the back. We ignored the host and just made our way towards them. nnAfter being seated it was impossible to get someone to stop at our table to ask questions about the buffet and menu. I thought about ordering off the menu,but my group wanted to go for the buffet, so I thought why not? Once we started eating, the only time we saw a server was when we needed refills on water and soda. No one ever stopped by to ask us how we were doing or took our plates. I even grabbed some plates and threw them on an empty bar where nobody was sitting because they were piling up. I also had to get up and grab my own sauces and napkins from the waiters supply corner...no customer service whatsoever, but this is an Asian restaurant so who knows if they even care. There was also not very many people there for the noon lunch hour compared to what you would expect when experiencing a lapse in service. Maybe  of the restaurant was full if even. Had the restaurant been completely full, I wouldve taken that into account. There was also some confusion when we were paying our bill so it seems like the hostess dont know what theyre doing either.nnThe buffet featured items such as chow mein, pad thai, garlic wings, mint chicken and other typical buffet foods. The selection was small as there were only  tables worth of food. Most of the food was bland pad thai especially and some of the fried items were  dough and not much filler egg rolls, fried banana are examples. The only thing that I really ate more than a couple bites of was the chow mein and garlic wings...show I really just filled up on wings. Not really what you would expect at a Thai restaurant.nnWhile I was eating, I was already thinking about how I was going to word this review because I was unhappy the entire meal. Keeping in mind that it was only the buffet that we had, makes me want to go back and try ordering items from their menu. However, the service was a real turn off and Ive had better service at fast food joints than what I had today at Lotus. I doubt wed be back in the future. Not sure how this place got their Zagat rating because Im pretty sure service counts for something."

0,"From the beginning dealing with this place was a disaster however, being as though we had booked it for a bridal shower, sent out invites  the whole  yards we decided to stick it out. Before I knock the customer service  the planner hardly Debbi  morrow I will say the food was excellent  the place is updated  clean. The food  the atmosphere will not be enough to make me come back. Debbi had repeatedly not returned phone calls, everyone working there gave different information regarding questions about seating, how food would be served, linens, You name it. I wont even begin to say what a disaster the shower was  the how the planner sat at the bar the whole time with her husband or whoever the other owner is. Debbi, you ruined our experience  made a joke of your restaurant when they heard you screaming from the bar area. Needless to say I will never, ever come back  Im sure I can speak for the other shower guests when I say they wont either. Maybe this place needs to rethink there planning staff."
0,"I agree its overpriced. Also overrated and poor customer service. nWe were very excited about going to this restaurant and waiting for it to open. Bit of a let down. nnFood was ok. We had the Chicken Saltado, Ajued de Gallina  Chicha Morada a drink. The drink I liked more than the food  it tasted like sugar cane juice. Measly serving. Loud music, exotic ambience and Peruvian scenaries on TV screens. Seating not bad.nn The waiter was overenthusiastic when we were first seated  there were not so many people in the restaurant. Every time we said thank you, he would say  No Thank you!! I was tempted to say  oh no Thank you and so on  It had a Sienfeld episode type of potential! Not saying this in a bad way. Really thought it was funny, until  or more groups came trickling in and this one person was taking orders, serving and even makingshaking cocktails. The guy was literally zipping around like a jack rabbit trying to cope and I could see the stress. We waited for what seemed like ages for our check and finally I decided to go get the check myself you guessed right  he was also the cashier!!!!. He did not look too happy that I came up to ask for the check and with a frown, slapped the bill on the table. I paid and turned to leave.. No thank you or any other nicety you may be used to hearing in most restaurants in this pricey Scottsdale neighbourhood. nnNot worth it! For the price and small portions they should be able to afford more waiters. And this was a Friday evening. I wish them luck. It is a mom  pop kind of place and I hate to see more of those disappear."
0,"Had to try the Kobe beef burger. It was good, but nothing special. The  stars could be one even was for how long it took for us to get our food. The restaurant was pretty empty, too. I tried the sunrise hawaiian drink and it was not good. It was supposed to be raspberry, orange, and vodka. The color was bland and the taste even more bland. I guess we had to try it just once. Never again."
0,"Take out Lots of rice in the take out and a good pile of the main course too. Quality isnt top notch, but they are trying to give lots of food for the price, geared for family dining on the cheap. ie.  Plenty of celery and onions... nnFor another dollar or two a plate you can do better. And the shame is so could they, but Im sure they know what their clients want. Quantity over quality."
0,"I have always wanted to go here. It looks so fun from the outside. FINALLY the time has come. The staff was extremely friendly, food was above decent and decent portions.

Its am and the trash cans are overflowing, there are empty toilet paper rolls scattered about and it smells. It was like a dressed up gas station bathroom. The garbage can next to our table was full and was dirty. There are tons of  things hanging from the ceiling that will catch your eye. the one that caught my eye was the giant chinese food container near the entrance and not far above from where we were sitting.. while cute and fun it was also filthy. This place needs a power wash.."
0,Food was not even close to being authentic Mexican.  I have never had mexican topped with cheddar cheese.  We had  people in our party and they gave us  very small bowl of salsa and when we asked for another one we were told there would be a charge.  Terrible food and service and kinda pricy.  Would not recommend.
0,"Thai Express is one of the places that I would not mind going when I need food quickly or when I simply do not want to cook for the night. I tried this one and ordered for a togo.

It looked like they do not clean until the store closes. It was a bit.. disgusting.nnSecond, its salty. VERY salty. Food was very oily too. The togo box looked like a garbage can after it dried... I actually couldnt finish eating because it was too salty. I had to drink at least L of water after to remove that salty feeling on my tongue..."

Just stood there and looked annoyed at me for picking a sandwich they didnt have the bread for. My bad bro.

I said, why not  she got very stern  rude and said we just dont split up bills, they wrote it up on one ticket  that is the way it is. I asked her why she is being so rude?

0,"AVOID THIS ER  The wait is ridiculous.  I took my mother here and we waited  hours and she never saw a doctor.  We ended up just leaving  but they never took her insurance information dummies, and sent her a ridiculous bill for hundreds of dollars just for the privledge of sitting around and being denied medical care.  The nursing staff who worked there were completely unsympathetic and inhospitable.  These nurses were cruel gatekeepers to the actual doctors.  Everyone who worked there seemed to hate their job and were unwilling to do anything other than the bare minimum.  nnThe ER was packed with people and some girl was puking in those pink plastic basins while waiting.   A janitor came by and cleaned ONE CHAIR and ignored an entire row of empty seats.  Sounds sanitary, huh?  I wonder how many already sick people get sicker because the germs they are exposed to while waiting to get medical attention.nnA few months later, I had a medical emergency and I went to Southern Hills hospital instead.  I was immediately checked in, was seen by a doctor and put on an IV in the first  minutes, and I was checked into the hospital in less than two hours.  The ER room there was empty because it is a much less residential part of town.   I also hear that San Martin Hospital on Warm Springs near Durango has a good ER.nnThey built so many houses in Summerlin and then didnt think that they should have a big enough hospital to accommodate all the people.  Its ridiculous and I will always make the extra drive to another hospital."
0,I am actually writing this review from my parked car due to the rude or should I say lack of service I received. There were several ladies sitting at a small round table outside the door smoking as I came in. There was a class in process in the store. I was very quiet and walked the perimeter of the shop looking at thier selection. No one greeted me or asked if they could assist me as I looked at their merchandise. This is my rd bead store visit today as I am looking for supplies and it was by far the worst both in service and lack of merchandise.
0,"The waiter was fantastic, but the service stopped there.  It took us  minutes to get our drinks after ordering at our table.  The food was lackluster and prices too high.  Due to capacity restrictions, our friend walked outside for just a moment to check on something and was not let back inside.  After speaking with the manager, he indicated that it was just tough luck.  He didnt care.  We left never to return...btw party of !!!"
0,"The Optometrist was great, very helpful and gives you free samples...ect. No problem with him...but not sure who hires the staff. WOW. I am not a picky person but this was crazy. First of all, they were supposed to call me for a follow up visit when they got my contact order in. NEVER CALLED ME. When I called the store asking if they got my contacts...they said...hmm, cant find the order...guess they were never ordered. They said they would check with the doc and call me asap. NOPE...no call back. I call the next day...someone else answers the phone. I say..nobody called me back yesterday...they said my contacts were never ordered. They said..no...your contacts are here and we tried to call you on the th to come in. Nope...checked my phone and voicemails...NOTHING. Then I come in for the follow up. Oh..you didnt need an appt...you just need to try the contacts on and go OK....then WHY did the person on the phone tell me to come in for an appt!?!?!?! The front office is unorganized, rude, inexperienced ect. I was shocked these people were even hired. Even as I sat in the waiting area....people were walking in complaining....saying they never received a phone call...ect. DO NOT come here. An older lady was giving me odd dirty looks that worked in the glasses area as well!!?? What the heck!?!? Shocked they are still in business."
0,"So, I love the look of the place.  Um, that is all you need to know.  Food was just barely there, service was worse.  If I get a dish that has a side of ravioli, I hope the ravioli is not out of a box of wonton wrappers.  And if it is wonton wrappers, please take the time to cook them.  I trust if the chef is there I would have had a better experience.  Sorry Vegas, but this review is not staying in town."

When I dug into my burrito, NO MEAT just all tasteless dried, refried beans. TASTELESS. Then my wife said her Tacos where bland and had a funny flavor. The meal was pretty bad. Save your Money and go the Chipolti Mexican Grill and get better tasting food and a better deal. Fajitas is just plain bad food."
0,"Lets face it its a Wendys.  You know what the menu is, and what to expect.  Really, all you can review is the service, which is pretty bad here.  nnMy order has been consistently wrong here.  When I get a salad, or a sandwich with lettuce, the lettuce is not fresh.  The service is rather poor.  Specifically, it takes noticeably longer to get food at this location, and often, the staff arent making sure they are making food to order.  nnAdditionally and this may seem like a strange note the line rails leading up to order in the restaurant are not set like every other Wendys.  It doesnt use the space well, and its not clear where to stand. nnMy office very close to this location, yet I go out of my way to the Wendys at  Boyer Street instead.  They have much better service."
0,"Dont waste your time, unless you like to wait to be seated or a noisy truckdriver cafe type of atmosphere. Too busy  midstrip and slow service. Very expensive and mediocre food. Its just not worth the hassle or the time  forget it. Go north to Dennys near the Stratosphere  or to McDonalds across the street and save some bread  and aggravation."
0,"Me and my friend decided to stop by here after a movie at waterfront. nThere was so much food, and it was all pretty goodespecially the dimsum dishes, and the chinese food. However the sushi had old rice, and fish that was not that fresh, and was weirdly watery.nnHowever, the thing that really killed this place for me was the service. The waitresses were more concerned with flirting with regulars then helping. Literally, they stopped at every table around us to talk, chat within themselves, and basically socialize with everyone aside from us. And when our bill came, they circled our table awkwardly until we paid. We asked them to separate our check, and they only gave us one receipt. Plus they coerced me to pay for my friends tip bill. The waitress literally wouldnt stop speaking to me in Chinese until I paid for my friends tip, even though he was about to pay the tip in cash. Not that they really helped us...nnOverall, the service just really killed it for me. We were nicely dressed college students, and the service and attitude towards us was so cold, and then straight up rude that I dont want to come back."
0,"Oh gawd, another shitty Chinese food place in Surprise. This place is actually ran by Chinese people but of course they stick with Asian actually American favorites. I guess tried and true pays the rent every month but they should know that different pays off, look at Vogue Bistro.nnTried a few lunch specials including Kung Pao Chicken and Ma Po Tofu.. each came with a soggy spring roll as well as white rice. However if you eat in youll also get a bowl of soup and a salad, we did take out. The Kung Pao was Kung lame with not much flavor or heat. The Ma Po Tofu was bland and didnt have any of the veggies that the menu promised. Even the addition of chile paste could save this one. However the Chicken Egg Rolls are pretty good and managed to stay crispy. nnPei Wei is still the best Surprise has to offer on terms of Asian food, though that isnt saying much at all."

Called after an hour to check status of delivery,  Your pizza is on its way lie.  minutes later....same response  it should be there any minute lie.  minutes later....So sorry, should be leaving in  minutes Are you kidding me?

0,"we were disappointed with our cooking class for cuban food. the ad and online class description had no mention of pork, only jerk plantain and black bean dish, so it was to our dismay when we arrived and there were no black beans, only pork! nnso we couldnt really even eat. we cooked the pork and gave it to a classmate. and even the plantains....like eating dried out cornbread. absolutely no taste. i thought it was just me because im not really a good cook, but our other classmates had the same complaint. nni didnt find this experience very educational at all. it was in a nondescript kitchen prepcook warehouse way the hell out in the west valley. luckily and with good business sense, the organizer agreed to refund our price because the advertisement was misleading. nnwe probably wont do this again. maybe youll have better luck."
0,"Lousy cleaning from start to finish. The vacuum guy literally opened each of the four doors and stuck the nozzle inside for no more than  seconds. nWipe down was done poorly as well. Besides not cleaning the inside glass, the same rag went from tires and wheels to my interior door panels. Like I really wanted muddy streaks on the inside!!! nLazy, maybe untrained employees speaks to poor management practices."

Well if you did that you would find yourself here.nnI flew in for my bday not too long ago and it was hilarious.

0,"Going to try to get my money back from Groupon, I purchased it and they already told me they are sold out for over a month, also the lady emailing me Kathy the Chef what a joke.. was not very nice or helpfu at all, I emailed her for clarification about whether or not they had classes available, you cannot call to talk to anyone they only want you to email them, its ridiculous, she emailed me and  told me to go back online and look up the August schedule she did not offer to give me any other info but that I need to look closer on their website,the  problem is, the schedule for the month Im interested in August is not posted YET what are they waiting for its almost August, it only shows what dates are sold out but offers no information about what dates have classes for my childs age or any schedule info for Augus classes, so they are only telling you what dates you cannot go but no info on which classes are available still and what types of classes they are??? it says August schedule coming soon but today is July th, dont you think they should have the schedule up for August by now yet she already knows shes pretty much sold out for August according to her email to me?? I plan to get my Groupon money back and apply it elsewhere, I took a free trial a year ago and also did not sign up then, figured Id give it one more shot with the Groupon deal but they continue to leave a bad taste in my mouth, I recall my daughter rolled out a pillsbury biscuit dough and some helper lady in there was yelling at the kids to hurry up and wash their hands in a very nasty way, it was their first class and they were  and  year olds and I felt my child did not take away anything from this class and do NOT pay . for a class here, you can teach them more on your own at home plus they sell stuff in the lobby that is overpriced like a measuring spoon with their logo on it give me a break  the description is NOTHING like what you get when you go there.  Save your money for some other class.  Also have to say that upon taking the free trial class the red flag went up when they said we could not watch our join our kids, so for an hour stay crammed in the lobby with hardly any chairs for parents to sit and wait, I dont know about anyone else but I wasnt going to leave my  year old in a strange place with these crabby ladies or any stranger even if they were nice people so they should have a spot for parents to watch the class.  Uhh!!"
0,"I went with a group of three on a Friday night around pm.  The first thing I hear when I get there is multiple tables complaining about the slow service.  I should have taken this as a sign. We ordered the stuffed chicken wings, fried wontons, and the Thai pork chops.  While the food wasnt anything to write home about, the service was slow, didnt provide silverware, and when we got plates they were dirty. The Thai tea was decent."
0,"At the end of July I contacted the  reservation line at Alamo to make plans for a car rental from August August  at the Charlotte airport location. I was going to be using my Hilton Honors points to secure this car, and was told by Hilton that BEFORE I took points from my bank to make sure that this location accepted points as payment, as some locations do not, and to make sure there were no blackout days. your  reservations team told me to contact the airport location to confirm that they would accept pmt with points, which I did, and was told there are no blackout days for this program. They said go ahead and retrieve your code necessary from hilton and call us back to reserve. nnI got the necessary code from Hilton the following Monday and called the  , but was told to call the location to secure thew reservation since I would be using points. I then called Charlotte lonely to be told they dont make reservations there, call the   again.....nSo I called back to the reservation line and was told that while Charlotte accepts the points program and there are no blackout days, they had reached the limit of the  of reservations allowable under that program for the day and would not make my reservation. They sent me to an escalation dept where I takes to a gentleman named Norman.  He was pleasant, but of no use..... He said he wild pass my info to a supervisor and ask that they call.  I waited.....nI called corporate in St. Louis and asked for someone that could assist me, only to get Norman again. He said I had to wait for a call. No one else would help me.    A few days later I get a rude call from Angie at the Charlotte location  she left a voice mail that said she cant help me, call the reservation line.  So once again I called the  ad  spoke to a very nice girl, maybe Lakresha??  African American girl that was the most pleasant person to work with. She tried everything she cod to get me a car close to the dates I needed, with my points , but to no avail.  nnSo I ended up paying for a rental, . that had not been budgeted for, and Ive lost , points with Hilton and got NOTHING for it but a disgusting run around from Alamo. nnI fell was dealt with very unfairly and not given the true restrictions behind using Alamo for my rental. I confirmed no black out days and then given the surprise But......nI would never have risked this transaction had I been told that a rental may still not be possible.   nAfter emailing customer service and getting an incident number assigned to me I was toldnn I completely understand your frustration. I have document this email thoroughly and will do my best to get you the resolution you deserve. I have also forwarded this email and your contact information directly to the Regional Customer Service Department for Charlotte. They will reach out to you within the next  days. Your Incident ID number regarding this issue is . again I apologize for the inconvenience this has cause you. If you have any additional questions, comments or concerns please feel free to reach out to me and I will aid you in any way I possibly can.nnWell, weeks later I have no phone call, and more emails that blame me for not booking far enough in advance, missing the entire problem of their sales people not stating the policy, IN FULL, for renting a vehicle using Hilton Honors points. nnNever EVER again. Stay away from this group of companies."
0,"Great location right on Blvd St. Laurent with tables right beside the public walk. The service is good and the staff is friendly, but.......... And this is a BIG but.........the food  not so good. nThe spaghetti with smoked salmon was swimming in sauce and the smoked salmon was lost in the blend. The presentation was uninspired and the flavour muddy. nThe burger with blue cheese, burnt bun, unevenly applied condiments, greasy fries, caesar salad dripping with dressing.nThe actual patty was obviously some cheap frozen burger, that had alot of water seeping out of it, as well as a strange texture.  nIn closing, way too expensive for what you receive. nNever again!"
0,Expensive and small portions! Im a server and bartender . I went with my friend because of the great reviews but the reviews were obviously made by friends of the employees... The food tasted great but it was SMALL portions.   a plate for two bites small!  Im a lite eater and only weigh  pounds so when I say small I mean SMALL! nWine was not on the list but we ordered it anyways.. It was !?!? nStill hungry after paying so much was insane! nServer was very very nice and helpful and took off half the price for the wine so the bill came out to around  dollars. nGood and service was phenomenal but it was soooo expensive. I dont recommend.
0,"Jaleo was one of the worst restaurants Ive ever been to when considering the quality of the food and the price point.nnIts not that the concept isnt intriguing. Tapas restaurants are an excellent concept which can provide fantastic flavor combinations and lots of options for customers to choose from. When youre traveling with a group, its great to order several tapas and share.nnI also want to be clear that I think the staff at Jaleo was top notch, friendly, and timely. I appreciated that on a busy Thursday night.nnThe problem with this place wasnt the concept or the service. The problem was the food.nnI went with a group of six people and personally tried  different tapas during the course of the meal. We would have ordered several more if the food wasnt so underwhelming.nnWhat I triednnThe pan de cristal con tomate fresco, which was , was some dry, stale bread with what tasted like a can of tomato sauce dumped on top. It was sloppy. It was flavorless.nnThe croquetas de pollo , were served in a shoe. Literally, the food was in a paper cone that was place inside of an old shoe. Why would anyone think thats clever or appetizing? The croquetas were decently cooked, but still lacked flavor.nnThe gambas al ajillo , were flavorful, but the portion size was minuscule for a  dish.nnThe remolacha con cuedtricos  was drenched in the dressing, though it wasnt bad otherwise.nnThe worst of it all, in my viewnnJosues patatas bravas  was seriously a individuallysized bag of potato chips you know, the one theyd sell for . in a vending machine covered in mayo and sriracha. They even took up a third of the plate with the empty bag cut in half, as if that was something that would impress a diner. The chips werent great most of them were crushed, and the sauce combination was fine, but this was an embarrassing thing to have on the menu in my view. An absolute shame.nnThe consensus about this place from those of us who had dinner that night and tried tapas other than those I listed was that it was the worst meal we had in our weeklong stay in LV.nnIm by no means someone who expects to have a five star meal every time I go out, and I understand the Vegas expense is always higher than it is other cities. I also understand that in a busy shift, some meals dont always turn out as well as they should. But the fact that all of the tapas we ordered had serious flaws is indicative of a systemic issue in the restaurant.nnMy disappointment in this meal compelled to share this experience. With all of the wonderful and delicious options in Vegas, dont waste your money going here."
0,"Fail. EPIC Fail.nnI thought that BART was bad, and then I ride this.nnWe were a bit drunk, and decided wed take a ride to go meet up with another friend instead of walking a couple of miles. , one way, one trip!?!?!

Considering  guys x  tickets  , we couldve easily gotten a cab for all of us for half of that.nnNeedless to say, we walked the rest of the entire trip and never once set foot back into a Monorail station."
0,"This will be concise we requested a quote for my iPhone issues, and were immediately sent a text by the technician, Eric.  I wanted to support him because he is a UNLV grad and had good reviews.  He gave us a reasonable estimate but said he could not do the repair until the weekend was over because he was missing parts.  We told him never mind because we needed it done over the weekend.  He wrote back that he located the parts and gave us a time frame.  We agreed to a specific time and location on Sunday.  He said he would text us when he was on his way.nnWe never heard from him, so at the scheduled appointment time, we texted and called him.  We did not get a call back or a text back.  So he is unreliable and I still have a broken phone.  Dont waste your time."
0,"This is not the best Indian food in Vegas, Im disappointed to say. nnThe Buffet has not changed since folks last reviewedin fact it was the same lineup, the service was poor, I asked the waiter for Garam Masala rice, basic White Basmati with hot spices, but he could not make it happen.nnMy family had never been to an Indian place and they loved it, could not stop talking about finally eating the lamb, got to love the Holidays.nnFinal reviewnBasic Indian Buffet,  per person is an expensive lunch in this town, could be done a lot better, One Star"
0,The service here is soooooo slow!!!! You shouldnt have to wait  minutes in the drive through when theres only two cars ahead of you!  This happens more often than not!  They need to hire more baristas during peak times!
0,"Kenny is extremely rude.  I order from here on a weekly basis and every time he asks me not to pay with my credit card because it takes too long.  Im sorry Kenny this is the st century and I dont carry cash.  Tonight when I called and said hold on I need to grab my card my fault I thought I knew where it was when I dialed he responded with we are too busy.  You are two busy to take an order and get money??  Then I found it and started to read my card.  When I got to the third set of numbers he said hold on I need to go cook.  Excuse me?  Do not answer the phone if you need to be cooking.  You my friend lack in customer service.  The gentleman he handed the phone to was extremely kind, as all of the other employees are there.  If it had not been for him I would have hung up and taken my business elsewhere.  I think in the future I may do just that.  Kenny if you are going to own a restaurant learn how to treat your customers.  Especially ones that order frequently."
0,"AVOID!!! AVOID!!! AVOID!!! Absolute joke of a company! Every negative review on here echoes my experience with Brandon and Athena Plumbing APC.  After being sent out by my home warranty company to confirm that my hot water heater was broken, Brandon provided me with an itemized list of additional costs outside of what my home warranty would cover.  Being someone that works with contractors dayin and dayout, I understand when someone is being honest or trying to empty my pockets, which Brandon tried.  A  drip pan was itemized on my invoice as I get a small markup but  which doesnt even include installation of the drip pan?!.  My biggest gripe of all was that Brandon also attempted to refer his friend from an equally shady company to dry out and replace dry wall that was damaged as a result of my hot water heater leaking.  His buddy from Dryluxwhich has equally poor reviews on here and BBB did not provide me with an estimate and kept pressuring me to allow his guys to come out and begin work all the while insisting insurance would cover everything....right.  Being pretty handy myself and not wanting to involve my insurance company knowing that I would surely be out of my , deductible, I opted to do dry wall repairs myself.  Upon making Brandon from APC aware of this, his tone suddenly changedbecause he was upset he wouldnt be getting a referral spiffkickback from his buddy at Drylux.  When it came time for Brandon to replace the water heater, my home warranty contacted me and had an itemized list of additional costs that I would be responsible for.  The problem was, the list they reviewed with me included an additional  that was not listed on the original itemized invoiceestimate Brandon provided. If you are considering having APC do anything at your home, I highly suggest you spare yourself the headache and dishonest business practices and contact a reputable, BBB accredited business. Do yourself a favor and read the reviews on here and on the Better Business Bureau."
0,"My mother lives in this community, so Ive eaten here a bunch of times.  This time was no different.  The food is solid, not spectacular, and the service is predictably bad.  nnDetails of this last Sunday lunch  nAmbiance  Beautiful views of water, ducks, golf course and mountains.  Nice, bright interior.  Comfortable chairs.  A good place for breakfast, lunch or brunch.  nnService  Server showed littleno personality, but thats not her job.  She was quick on the water my glass was soapy at first, but never stopped by to refill a single drink during the entire meal.  She really fell apart as the meal went along.  Before I discuss the food, it took  minutes after we ordered to receive our food.  This is typical of every time Ive been here.  DO NOT COME HERE IN A RUSH.  This is acceptable for a fine dining restaurant, but not a cafestyle eatery.  nnFood  My salmonblackberry salad was perfectly prepared and delicious.  My kids grilled chicken caesar was overcooked and completely dried out.  My gfs fishchips seemed ok.  My other kid got the angus sliders ordered without cheese.  The homemade potato chips were, and are always excellent. nnService again  However, I could see something yellow on my daughters burgers from across the table and got a closer look.  The chefcook had prepared them with cheese but someone noticed his mistake.  Instead of remaking them, they tried to pull the melted cheese off the meat and grilled onions obviously failing.  When I pointed this out to the server and chef, I was asked youre already getting a discount, what do you want me to do about it?  This is a direct quote from yesterday.  I had purchased a coupon from restaurant.com work perk  which rhymes, lol and she was giving me crap for the coupon.  In the end, the sliders were taken off the ticket.  nnThis experience is no different than every other time Ive been here.  I keep trying because my mother lives in the community and its convenient and beautiful.  However, nothing has improved here in the three years Ive been here  visits.  Food is star, service is star.  Prices are low, but not low enough for the frustration of every single visit."
0,"Why is it so hard to deep fry your frozen rolled tacos to a crispy finish so I can enjoy a crunchy experience the whole way through? Only the ends seem to ever be crispy at any Valley taco shop. The middle remains a soft mushy mess of frustration time and time again. After I eat your lousy rolled tacos, I can never go back because if you cant accomplish that feat, then the rest of your food will likely fall in line. The six rolled taco combo was also kinda cheapass. They only put guac on the things, no sour cream, lettuce or anything. Lets also throw in the fact that you must pay for the hot carrots and your lack of a salsa bar is ignorant in . Oh, yeah, the cheese quesadilla was the only redeeming item I purchased. After four green beers, usually most Mexican food tastes good, but this meal was a glaring exception."
0,"Went here after all the great reviews.  I thought this place was mediocre compared to all the other steak places in Vegas foodwise.  The Venue is very nice and the server are very attentive.  I bought a travelzoo gift certificate and got a  course meal which included soup,  steak and desserts.  We also ordered some french fries and mac and cheese.  nnThe soup was very good, rich and very tasty.  The steak I ordered was medium, but it came back cooked a little bit more than my friend liked.  We did let the manager know when he asked us if the food was good and he kind of joked that we ate the whole meal and then complained.  The appetizers were ok.  The french fries were massive and were a meal in itself.  nnThe dessert was also average at best.  I think for ambiance the envy steak house is ok but for food people can do better in Vegas. ."
0,"Terrible service, no class, could not handle our party of  people. They never brought peoples food out, messed up orders, and did zero accommodations for their mess ups. Worst Hooters Ive ever been to in  years!!"

0,"Worse service in Las Vegas!!nnMy husband, daughter and I showed up at  am on our way home.  We were greeted by a Mexican....in a Chinese restaurant.  The other  Asians that work there were setting at a table by the kitchen.  I am not exaggerating when I say they STARED at us the entire time.  It was uncomfortable to say the least.  We were all very nicely dressed and polite.  We ordered three appetizers and three drinks.  The spring rolls were brought out to us burned.  I asked them to please bring us some that was not burned.  The waiter was not rude but when he came back he said the kitchen would not remake them and he would take them off of the bill.  The staring continued!   The food was good that wasnt burned which is the only good thing I can say.  The appearance of the restaurant is questionable and the dead fish in the dirty tanks at the entrance should have made us turn around and leave!  After we left we found out the from  pm   am you get  off of your bill.....guess what.....we didnt receive that either!  This was the most uncomfortable eating experience I have ever had.  I dont understand the staring for the entire  minutes we were there!  We will never go back to this place!"
0,Compared to Hummus Express this place is a joke.  You get twice the amount of food with a much greater selection at Hummus Express. If you are on a diet eat here.  If you are hungry go to Hummus Express.
0,Well when you have  Beretta Nanos on your website one would think you have one in stock. Not the case. They do have a large selection but dont look online and expect to find it in the store. nnAs for the customer service... You would think that  customers to  employees would be a good ratio. No one said a word to me for  minutes and when I asked about what I was looking for I got a simple no. Browsed a bit more and never a word even when leaving?? nnI would also recommend shopping around for price. They are much higher than other stores. It is close to home and I will sometimes pay a bit more if your customer service is stellar but in this case I will take a drive and save some money.
0,"For the third time I stood at the counter while the two staff shot the bull with a couple also at the counter. Not once was a asked if I needed help, even after another staff member walked past me. You have lost a customer and I hope more shooters just roll past your shop."
0,"Horrible experience! Found this place while we were walking between casinos. They looked open so we walked in and sat at the bar. We could tell the bartender was busy but she took care of us pretty quickly and got our order in and got us some drinks. We were hungry so we ordered a pizza and some fries. After  minutes it was apparent there was something wrong in the kitchen. No one had a pizza at their table.  A few finally came out and they were for people who came in  minutes after us!  So, after an hour of waiting, with no one coming to check on us or tell us anything i asked the manager, Christy, about the status of our order. She was completely unprofessional and rude. According to her they were technically closed and re opened to accommodate your group and they were shorthanded. We should be patient and grateful that they were serving us.  WHAT!?  I was not part of any group that caused her back up. And furthermore, lady, you were not accommodating me, you reopened cause you saw a chance to make some money. If you didnt have the manpower, CHRISTY, you shouldnt have opened.  Minimum you should APOLOGIZE and check on my freaking order. And if you were having issues you should have stopped by sooner to let us know. Horrible customer service.  Will never go back and will warn EVERYONE."
0,"I love New York Pizza thus I was very excited to try this place out. Thank God for yummy ranch and honey mustard. It is the only reason why I was able to finish my lunch. I ordered a white pizza for myself and a side order of chicken tenders and fries for my daughter. We were starving so the second the food was placed on our table, my . year old daughter grabbed a fry and spit it out because it was so salty. On the other end of the spectrum, the chicken tenders werent seasoned enough. Hence, the need for honey mustard. And ketchup. And ranch. nnSince its a pizzeria, I was hoping that the pizza would be better, but the slice I was given was lacking in toppings and the crust was dry and hard. Again, ranch to the rescue.nnThe ladies at the table next to me looked like they were enjoying there salads, so maybe I will give them another try and hopefully update this review. The guys working there were friendly and it might be a cool place to stop in for a beer or drink. Just next time, I will get a pizza made to order fresh out of the oven instead of ordering by the slice."

0,"Just moved out from quest apartment homes and had been living there for  months.When I moved in,no one cleaned carpet for me or did any wall painting.I left apartment in perfect condition,cleaned carpet  times per year and then finally bought vacuum carpet cleaner to keep it cleaned as I have a puppy who was trained to pee on balcony on pad but she accidentally could do a mess and I was always right there to clean.nAs I have a dog,management decided to rip me off taking my  deposit due to having a carpet damage done by dog which is bullshit.they said they would replace the whole carpet for  or smth.i was wondering if its real to replace the whole carpet for that much money in  sq ft apartment as they dont do patch work that what I was told.i guarantee they just keep money and simply clean carpet without replacing it and then other renters will move in and the same thing will happen again.nMoved to Vegas bcoz my school is closer to drive.Thought I would be back in a year to Henderson or so but definitely not in to this place.nIt doesnt matter what,they will try to find an excuse to keep ur deposit.nThis is not fair when ppl are making rent business,taking rent pays and deposits from customers meanwhile you,as a customer,cant get any service for free except changing burnt bulbs.nThey would have had better reviews and higher rent  enrollment if they had done at least carpet cleaning for free to those customers who lived longer than a year.nnAnd furthermore,taking  non refund deposit for my dog,in addition  refundable deposit for the dog again and charging me rent  each month is way too much when you dont even have enough space to walk for the dog....like in a cage there.....poop is laying all over and garbage is scattered by the wind and spills of coffee and oil right before u enter ur building.obviously saving money on yard cleaning.nAlso they charge  non refund deposit when u apply to be renters,plus  refundable deposit in case of damages????!! Are u kidding me?nnnI do not recommend to move in to Quest Apartment Homes not because I dont get my deposit back,its simply due to not good care of apartments before somebody moves in and then when u move in you are trapped as they will say you damaged the carpet and this and that....nWhen I moved in,I hadnt had any dog yet,but pet hair was all over tucked between baseboards and carpetthe pet was living there before I moved in,even paint was on top of hairit means when they even do some cleaning and painting they dont do it properly,so lazy to clean and vacuum thoroughly and then put the paint on."

We were not happy from the beginning.nnWhen we saw the prices of the meals, it just got worse.  The food was okay.  Not worth the price.  The last two glasses of wine we poured once we finally were served our wine were filled with sediment.  The sommelier wasnt sympathetic.  He just said that he now knows not to serve that wine to anyone else.  Thats it... no comp or anything.  nnI will never go back here!!!  I thank them for ruining my evening on Fremont street."
0,"Great food but terrible service.  I think that you need to be a table that really keeps ordering bottle of wine after wine. We were completely ignored for  minutes after our main course. At that point we flag the waiter. They did apologized, but it was too late. They probably dont look at yelp, so my comment wont get to them."

I live nearby and and have tried Roman Candle multiple times, so Id like to say Ive given them a fair shot at winning my business. nnMy most recent and last experience was the worst. The Caesar salad was a sad bowl of lettuce and croutons, for  bucks. The dressing, which had a nasty thick yellow slimy film on the top was anything but Caesar dressing.... my husband and I think it may have been deviled egg filling??? P.s. they forgot the anchovies! Really, how many ingredients go in a Caesar salad? nnOn to the pizza, we had the margarita and Brad R. was right on the money.... not legit! They were out of basil what Italian pizza joint runs out of basil?, the mozzarella was not fresh at all and the tomatoes were pale and yellowish. Dont even get me started on the oversauced crust, the thin crust couldnt even hold up to it! This, along with the other pizzas Ive had there in the past, where not good. nnRoman Candle, I really wanted to love you, but Im tired of the disappointment!"
0,"I was pretty excited to eat here! the restaurant is really pretty but i wasnt happy with my experience... the place is way too loud, the portions are really small, price is very very expensive and our table was in the middle that the servers and guest were just walking on our sides and it just makes me uncomfortable and distracted..  the food was okay, nothing special or id be craving for."
0,"Rude staff.  minute wait for a drink, while the staff talks and jokes doing nothing. The bathroom was dirty with no TP. The concert area had cat droppings and dead mouse parts all over, and smelled like cat piss. You had to walk around to the front to find a server. Bad management.nThe bluegrass band was GREAT!!nToo bad the service sucks.nIm never going back, when there are friendlier venues down the street."
0,"Did anyone else get charged more then they signed for? Or was that just me? I am not happy at all for this. I am trying to get a hold of the bar but have no number. I was just there this past weekend used my card to pay signed for . no tip because I gave cash for the tip and yes I made sure I wrote that when I signed , today checking my bank statement I was charged  dollars, I know  dollars is not a lot of money but its the principal of the matter that counts it doesnt matter if it was ua they still shouldnt do that.  Im going to look into them now to see if theyve done this before if so legal action will be taken this is called robbery and I for one will not stand for it. So Becareful if you use your Card there."
0,"First time eating here. Lunch today, not impressed. Had the chicken ranch with fries. Not the best cut of chicken. Nothing outstanding that would want me to come back. Others in the party had burgers. Nothing to write home about. nJust average."
0,"So... when your establishment says they will be open at , and you arrive after , youd think they would have food ready. Not the case. An unenthusiastic, stonyfaced employee told us that they werent ready to serve anything yet. We asked if we could take a look at the menu in the meantime, and the employee told us to look at their website. Um... what restaurant doesnt at least have a list of their items available for people to look through at their physical location Or maybe he just didnt want us in the restaurant even though they are supposed to be open? Disappointed, we left and ended up just making breakfast at home.nnDespite getting the cold shoulder in the morning, fate brought us to this area again in the evening. After an outing with the pups at the dog park, Jeepney was within such close proximity that we decided to try some items to go. I entered and while the unenthusiastic employee glanced briefly at me, no Hi or Welcome was to come my way. I had to go around the counter and wait for a few minutes until he decided to ask me what I wanted to order. nnThere were maybe  items sitting in bins available, ready to serve up. I didnt see any heat lamps though, so Im not sure how they kept the food hot? Some of the items, like the pancit, looked really dried out on the surface as if they had been sitting out for a very long time Maybe since they started to make the food in the morning?. We ended up ordering  items with rice. They were as followsnnChicken adobo good taste, with bonein dark meat chicken. The sauce had a deep tasting soysauce flavored base, and reminded me of chicken my mom used to make when I was growing up.nnMechado This was a hearty beef stew. Another flavorful entree, with tender chunks of beef, and a thick tomato based sauce.nnOpo squash Sliced squash marinated in a vinegar based sauce. The delicate, slightly sweet flavor of the squash contrasted with the sourness of the vinegar well. It was decent, but not a favorite dish out of the .nnBopis Another person at the counter said that the meat in this dish was pork liver. Taking it home, trying it, and then looking at the menu online, this dish is actually made with pork heart, which has a distinctly different texture and taste. There were some chewy white bits, which turned out to be pork snout. While the meat itself tasted alright, the sauce was too murky tasting and indistinct for me to actually like it.nnI had actually requested a few other dishes, since I had browsed through the online menu before entering, but the employee said they were out of them Lechon Kawali, Dinuguan. nnThe price was very inexpensive for the amount of food we got . per  item combo. However, since some of the items werent really that great tasting, and others looked very old, Im not sure Id order from the readymade trays again. Ive heard their family meal Boodle Fight is great, so maybe one of these days we will try Jeepney again in hopes of a better meal."
0,"Yall are officially on notice.  Why?  It was based on these reviews that I decided to try the place.nnI was totally prepared to wait when we arrived because we got there at about  on a Friday night.  They said  min wait for a party of . Not too bad.  After watching  groups who came in after us be seated first and yes, one was a party of  we approached the hostess stand to check on things.  Suddenly we were next.nnServer was Justin.  He said his hellos, told us about the specials, took our drink orders. Wed planned to try a few appetizers, but at that point we were all hungry enough we wanted to go right for the main course. Then we were brought the chips and salsa.  I inquired about the  salsas.  He said, this one is hot, this one is pico de gallo, and this is our pineapple salsa.  The chips werent just got out of a bag chips, they were noname, not very good, wouldnt serve them to my friends chips.  But, we nibbled on them anyhow because we wanted to try the salsas.  I went right for the hot.  Hot?  It was barely warm.  It was very tomato tasting, with one person commenting that it almost had spagetti sauce taste.  How can you be going for a Latin flavor and not be packing any heat??  I try the Pico de gallo.  Its chunky salsa.  But whatever.  It had that fresh taste that many salsas have fresh out of the bottle.  My last hopes were the pineapple salsa.  It was different, and in the end the one I actually liked the most because at least they were trying to be creative.nnCan you believe Im not to the main courses yet?  Justin sets them down quickly and makes his escape.  Visually  they were quite good.   of our folks got tortas  one beef and one chicken.  They were fine.  Both tortas and the burgers come with fries and the fruit slaw on the side. No one liked the slaw.Friend said it was more straw than slaw  To me, it was ok  but not worthy of the large portion it took on the plate.  Would have been MUCH better to just fill the plate with the waffle fries that were actually pretty good.  One person got shrimp enchiladas.  That was pretty good  but could have been done just as well or better by quite a few places in town.  I got the pork loin chops.  Honestly  with this being one at their highest price point, I figured I should really get to see their strength here.  It was pretty.  The two thin chops were cooked fine  but it wasnt cooked IN anything for extra flavor, which pork really needs.  It touted an herby garlic, cilantro, lime sauce.  It was green, and not bad, but with those things you would have thought it might have had more kick.  Or at least flavor. It wasnt bad in a way that detracted from the meal, but it didnt add much.  The green beans were at that same fine point.  They were very green and looked great.  But beyond the almonds someone threw on top again, not cooked with at all, just threw on top at the last minute there wasnt much flavor.   I buy the big frozen bag from Trader Joes, steam them, toss w a pat of butter, salt and pepper and they could kick the butt of these green beans. I didnt have that high of a bar, but they didnt even meet it.nnThe night was capped with some poor service mistakes.  Several of us had discussed trying a desert.  Instead of a request for desert, we got a check.  We figured it was a sign.  We were dividing the check into .  A friend who had been a server suggested that we mark the items that went on a particular card and then it was easiest for them to split the check.  We were explaining that to Justin as he was seemingly running from the table. Did we have ebola and no one told us?  When he accidentally put the wrong total on each card, and we asked him to switch the totals, rather than go do it, he was argumentative at the table for several minutes about how he did it right and kept trying to push fault to the friend who handed him the bill. he then stormed from the table like a  yr old saying as he went, Fine, Ill just have to go switch them.  Yea, thats all wed been going for.  The whole table felt uncomfortable and insulted.  A friend noticed we were dropped off to go boxes when all other tables had their food taken away and the server put them in the boxes.  I dont know if we just had an awful server or if he thought wed be bad tippers Ive never gone under  for good service  bad never gets less then  but it will be a long time before any of us go there again. The atmosphere was cute, but the food was not a good value and never really rose above Ok."
0,"Overheard people talking about this place earlier in the day and decided to give it a try.  The younger woman that helped me was rude and indifferent while taking my takeout order and when she brought it, did not even look me in the eye, or respond to me saying, thank you.  Although the food was good, that experience will not have me returning."
0,I would not recommend this place the service was substandard.  Try to sell loads of books  out of  were chosen and only for store credit worth . Theyre only interested in nonfiction and  low ball you especially wfiction  which you get store credit  the lowest possible. If a little water damage forget it  thought it was a used book store.
0,"Good food but horrible service. The messed up my order twice. I made an order online and went to go pick it up and they gave me the wrong order. Of course I didnt realize this until I got home but when I called them to let them know, I didnt even get so much as an apology. I asked if they could just have my food delivered since THEY are the ones who gave me the wrong order and I was told I had to drive back to get my food. When I went back, the lady just handed me my food and didnt say anything, she just walked away. The food I did order also had things missing from it but I was tired of waiting to speak with someone. I understand that they may be busy or short staffed but I dont understand the bad customer service."
0,"words can not describe the epic douchefactor that axisradius possesses. so why did i come here? two friends of mine were in from LA and they wanted to hit up Scottsdale and see what it was like. i have lived here for a year... A YEAR, PEOPLE!... and had yet to go to Scottsdale to experienced the ultimate in popped collars and sick belt buckles. so, i agreed to to take them out for an unforgettable night on the town. nnwalking up to this place, we immediately noticed the long ass line full of extremely cold OSUAuburn people attempting to get in. apparently this place charges a  cover but after a brief chat with the lovely bouncer, he let us through the other side for free.  cover in Phoenix? cmon. the place is kind of interesting when you first walk in. youre faced with a choice gravitate towards the rhythmic thumping of the techno on the Radius side OR shake what your mamma gave you to some hip hop on the Axis side. we explored Axis first. the people watching was AWESOME. drunk frat boys trying to score with equally if not drunker girls dressed in super shorts skirts,  inch heels, and no jackets because wearing a jacket when its  degrees outside is so lame. i also dug the older gentlemen who were stalking the younger ladies. they were pretty damn entertaining. i do have to say that the bartenders really were on point. they were fast, friendly, and knew their shit. i was grateful since drinking was pretty much required to get through the night.nnthe Radius side really didnt fair any better. actually, it was more sausage festy than Axis. lots of guys standing around with their Monsters  Vodka watching the spare population of girls dance. it looked like a grade school dance with boys on side and girls on the other, neither side willing to touch each other. Radius was definitely a lost cause.nni think i would have been super pissed if i had had to pay cover to get into this place, but seeing as it was free and the bartenders and people watching were entertaining, i guess it deserves  stars. i do reserve the right to bitch slap some sense into anyone who wants to go here though."
0,"Carlos n Charlies is located inside of the Flamingo Hotel and Casino. Its your Americanized Mexican food establishment. The food isnt authentic Mexican food at all, but the taste isnt that horrible. So why the  stars? The portions are too small, the price is too high and the service isnt the best. nnAt first our waiter was pretty chill, but after taking our order we didnt see too much of him after. I guess the only good thing was that he gave us a margarita for free since he made a mistake. nnFoodnI ordered the chicken enchiladas with rice. Everything was seasoned pretty well, but I wish it had more of a kick to it. Also, I honestly could have probably ate  plates since the portion really wasnt that large...nnOverall, Im glad I tried Carlos n Charlies one time, but I most likely wont be back. Id rather spend  on a meal that will actually fill me up."
0,"They have things that make them stand out as a coffee shop, but they strongly lack the things I need for it to be a return type place.nn. The only reason you will catch me in a coffee shop is because I need to use my laptop. So it needs free wifi and accessible wall outlets with comfortable seating. Im not sure if they had the wifi, but it was definitely a nogo on the wall outlets and seating.nThere was one table and bar like seating, but thats about it.nIts one of those very hole in the wall types, so make sure this would be your grabandgo kind of stop.nn. I dont drink all that fancy coffee. I drink black coffee, thats it. No cream, no sugar... just, coffee. The coffee I got here was burnt and it was self serve, I dont know how fresh that is. Pretty disappointing. nn. I do like that they offer a vibe that reminds me of San Diego a bit, and that they support local art and bands which is pretty epic. Reminds me of the place that I used to live across the street from. nnI do want to return just to try their food, their sandwiches seem reasonably priced, and Ill update my review if and when it happens. I was soooo looking forward to liking this place, it just didnt happen."
0,"I went with my Living Social coupon to try this place again after a long absence.  Its not that I didnt like the place originally  it had turned into a Chucky Cheese on the weekends since kids now eat free.  I had fond memories of the Cajun Nachos which I had there several times and absolutely loved.  The dish was the single reason I went back.  My friend and I sat in the bar area...no kids  perfect.  I presented the coupon as directed and the waitress came over quickly.  We ordered only waters and between that and the coupon, the waitress demeanor turned frosty to say the least.  I open the menu and discover that the Cajun Nachos are gone from the menu.  Not one to let things like that ruin a good time, I found spicy shrimp nachos that sounded pretty darn good.  We decided on those and the BBQ Chicken Nachos.....entree size for both.  Waittress came back to take order and we ordered drinks I had the Pamatini which was quite good.  Waittresss demeanor defrosted immediately and she was just fine the rest of the meal except for the nacho issue....see below.  I cant say the same for the Nachos.  Shrimp was better but neither blew me away.  They say they make all the chips fresh and while I dont dispute that, I was NOT impressed with the chips at all.  They tasted kind of stale and got mushy FAST.  I have had tons of good to great nachos over the years...these didnt make that list at all.  Btw...I asked about the Cajun Nachos they have both spicy shrimp and andouille sausage on the menu...I got a blank stare from the waittress.  Surely something could have been thrown together in the kitchen?  Nachos arent rocket science after all.  Her tip settled at a a flat  after that.  I usually go closer to .  Apparently there is a new chef and the presentation of the nachos is totally different and the menu changed....not for the better.  Bottom line  I wont be going back.  Im done."
0,"This place, which caught my eye en route to the Shadyside Mad Mex, is entertaining solely for its brazen ineptitude and fair to average food.  The friendly, but totally dizzy and distracted and ditzy,  servers are amusing to watch as they wander around in a stupor...basically kids new to the summer job, but they need some guidance and instruction. I ordered a frozen Margarita.....I was told it would take a half hour to make!!!   Talk about being wasted away again in NONMargaritaville!!!!  The tacos were of the Taco Belle school......just okay.  Their home made chips are good, though.  Maybe they need that guy on TV that whips whacky restaurants into shape.....although this place seems pretty successful. Folks were flocking in like sheep to the trough.  I will try it again....they gotta improve at some point."
0,"If you are Chinese dont go here! We got lost finding this place inside the Palms. Who knew it would be a restaurant in the back of a restaurant. . I thought to myself, Oooo this place might be nice because there were no forks on the table... then they brought the forks. I was so offended My girlfriend is a beautiful white girl and sometimes they assume westerners cant use chopsticks. Come on! even Japanese restaurants know better than that. Assume everyone knows how to use chopsticks. To solve this each time I place the forks on the next table over.  nnThe food was all basic entry level dim sum stuff. Stuff sat out too long. Seriously made to order would be better instead of this old stuff. That would have saved my experience. They had PF Chang like stuff on the menu too like Chow Mein, General Tso, probally orange chicken...etc . If you use a fork at any Chinese Restaurants you might like this place. Really expensive too."
0,"What were they thinking when they were pricing their menus?   average for a plate of ok mexican?  I can understand if its a gourmet restaurant, but this is really just a run of the mill strip mall kind of mexican restaurant...the kind that isnt really mexican at all.  Youll do better to hit Filibertos unfortunately.   nnI do have to give them props for mexican cheeses and not your usual yellow cheese boat like a lot of cruddy semimexican food joints like El BravoCarlos OBriens, etc.  nnTheir flan was flabby and too creamy, the chips ok, needed more salt.  Salsa was weird, but ok, kind of funky different.   I tried the margarita...no tequila flavor even though i thought I ordered Hornitos, it was all some icky sweetsour mix, not well done at all.  The chicken enchiladas were pretty tasty after all, good shredded chicken  nice flavor, nice green sauce, so it wasnt all bad, just wasnt that good for the price.nnThey do have a small outdoor patio, which is nice.  But with their entrees at , Im not going back.  There are so many very good small mexican joints around that have good fair prices with awesome food that this place wont last."
0,"Ok.nnIve been waiting for a few days to write this review, so I could synthesize just how disappointing this meal was.nnMy company Christmas party was in Las Vegas this year.  My bosses are both big foodies and theyd been to Ducasses restaurants before in fact, one of my bosses had been to his two other Michelin star restaurants in Europe, so we had high hopes.  I cannot believe how shitty this place was.  Yes, I said shitty.nnFirst, we had made a reservation to sit at the chefs table.  There were  of us and we wanted to make sure that we could all sit together at one large table.  They split us up in groups of  which is ridiculous, as we all had plus ones and threw us into the main dining room.  When my boss took issue with this new seating arrangement with the hostess, she curtly replied well thats not my problem, sir.  If youre the hostess and your customers prearranged seating gets mixed up, it is, in fact, your problem.  We decided not to talk to the manager about this because we didnt want people spitting in our food.nnSo we waited  minutes to have our initial drink orders taken.  Then  minutes later we got some bread.  During this whole waiting period our water was refilled to the very top of the glass at almost a comedic pace.  I know thats nitpicky, bu tit was rather hilarious in the moment.  We did the prix fixe menu, which you would think would be easy to keep track of, but I was brought the wrong dish for both courses.  The service mixed up our two tables consistently.  I had to stop the person delivering my entree and say I did not order this. Try the other table.  I was correct and someone at the other table ordered the fish. nnMy steak was fine, but the menu did not say it was a petite filet, and yet there it was.  I mean, it was good, but I was expecting a full filet, as thats how it was labeled on the menu.nnDessert was lovely, but the service was so horrible.  Our bill was over K for our entire table and it was some of the worst service Ive ever encountered.  Sure, the restaurant looks nice and the view from the lounge is great even though the Foundation Room at the Mandalay Bay has a better view and is basically attached to THE Hotel.  Just avoid this place.  Fluer is downstairs and from what I understand it is WAY better."
0,"Worst Panda Express ever! Possibly the worst meal weve ever spent money on. My hubby made the mistake of not checking the boxes of food before he left the restaurant. He came home with dinner. His teriyaki chicken was black, too burnt to eat. My beef and broccoli had one piece of beef and the fried rice was just rice and a little hard. Absolutely disgusting. Avoid this Panda Express by far the worst experience Ive had with them."
0,"I was not impressed with this place. I called because I wanted a last minute manicure and it was close by. The woman on the phone quoted me their special price of  for a gel manicure. The man doing my nails was nice, but it was weirdly quiet in there. No music or anything. I had a glitter overcoat on my nails and, while I appreciate that he was trying to get a lot of glitter on my nails, it turned out lumpy. He had to fix two nails and there was another lump I didnt bother asking him to fix. And the Polish is off the nail on a few fingers... When I went to pay, he said it was , not ! When I said what I had been quoted he said that was fine. But, even though it said they take card, he asked me to go to the grocery store next door and get cash out. Which required me to buy something. Then they only have multiples of , so I paid him  after I had already tipped him and he didnt offer to give me change. I dont think I will be going to this place again.... I ended up paying as much as I would have at a higher end place anyways."
0,"We hired him for a pool party for a Girls weekend in Arizona with  girls.  He brought his wife as his assistant, although she didnt assist him with much of anything.  She came in her bikini, got in the pool, and joined our party.  It would have been fine if she was actually FUN.  All his wife did was make pissed off faces when we were doing keg stands and having a good time with OUR group and OUR party.  We made dinner for everyone and the both of them ate before everyone else ate... then went back for nds... and then rds!  Before everyone had something to eat.  He charges by the hour and at the last hour, he and his wife got into the spa with us.  We are not paying you to relax in the spa with us!  Thats when they were asked to leave.  They then proceeded to go into a VERY small downstairs bathroom together and they were in there for  minutes.  What were they doing?  I dont even want to know.  I confronted him about it and there was no apology, no recognition of his unprofessionalism, and just plain rudeness.  One thing that he said was I dont know where you girls are from... but here in Arizona, we do things differently.  WHAT?!  Really?  So in Arizona its ok for a vendor to go into the bathroom and do God knows what with their wife?  Then he kept saying but shes my wife.  Come on now, Im appauled.  On top of all that, he kept demanding us to serve him, saying on the Mic I NEED A MARGARITA!.  In the meantime, he wife is just strolling around our house at her leisure, sitting in the kitchen watching our friends make food, and just making the whole situation awkward.  Thumbs down DJ Adidas!"
0,I used to love this place until recently. I have been going to Sandbar for over  years now and I have always had wonderful service but one bartender changed my mind. The bartender was too busy on her phone and TAKING SHOTS to give me even remotely decent service.The same bartender did this TWO WEEKS IN ROW and there is no way she is even . She took three shots in front of us that sitting. I asked for a menu after she finally made us a horrible Cadillac margarita. I still have yet to see those menus and I asked her twice. About an hour later I asked her what her name was and If i could talk to the manager. She told me her name was Tory and she would grab the manager when she was not busy. She didnt look busy to me just drunk and never sent anyone over. We paid our tab and left and will never be back. Its a shame that one bartender ruins the whole experience.
0,"So, its our th anniversary and my husband and I planned a nice dinner out since we had a sitter for our daughter til midnight!  We dont get out often, as our  year old daughter has cerebral palsy and is in a wheelchair and nonverbal.  Nice dinner and a bottle of wine later, we decided to find a room with a jacuzzi tub for a few hours that was close to home.  So I search jacuzzi hotel rooms Henderson, NV and HGI pops up in the top .  Pretty good ratings, so I make the call.  Girls answers, and I ask if they have any rooms with Jacuzzi Tubs.  She says yes that would be our something or other suite.  Would u like me to check on the rate for you?  Please.  Are u a AAA or AARP member?  No, though do u offer a locals discount?   No we dont.  The rate is  per night.  Do u have one of those rooms available for tonight?  Yes we do.  Would you like to reserve that?  Yes, please.  What credit card would u like to use?  So, give her the credit card info, we arrive  mins later, check in with a guy at the desk and my husband and I proceed to our suite with a jacuzzi tub.  Just one problem....NO JACUZZI TUB!  Seriously?  My husband goes in search of bottled water downstairs and sees that the girl is now at the front desk with the guys that checked us in.  He tells her that the room has no Jacuzzi tub and the guy says that they do have a room available with a Jacuzzi tub, though, it was out of service.  Seriously???  So, the girl offers to give us a whole  off our rate for the evening.  Gee, thanks!  My husband says to her, My wife asked you one questions we she called.....Do you have any rooms available WITH a Jacuzzi tub?  You said yes, we gave you our credit card and here we are, in a room with no Jacuzzi tub.  Not only did we not get the Jacuzzi we were promised, the  credit was not given either!  Customer service is nonexistent at this Garden Inn."

0,"I would give this place zero starts if I could, visited this spa twice and although its a very beautiful establishment I was not so impressed. The robe, ladies room, locker are and snacks in waiting room are just fab! But your not paying for a brownie, therefore the quality of the facial, massage, mani, pedi, etc need to be up to par. I got the massage, facial and pedi and. The facial was ok but I kept being talked into purchasing product. The massage wasnt relaxing nor a deep tissue, didnt feel like the gal had much experience. The pedi was the only decent part. Spoke to the manager about my concerns and she was not helpful at all. Establishment was not professional or offer good customer service. Making the W look bad as it is such a nice and beautiful hotel with  star amazing customer service. Very disappointed and not going to be a return customer."

They want documentation that I cannot provide. I said I dont have a lease or utility bill as I live with my parents. Then we cant cancel you. WHAT???nnWhen they tried to hit me up for the cancellation fee and I said I specifically asked and it was never mentioned to me, the person in billing said, We dont have to tell you. It is in the back of your contract. You should have read your contract before you signed it. Our job is to sell. We dont have to tell you anything else.

0,I Really really want to love this place and for my kids to love it but it is just ok. For one the hours stink. Closed on Mondays in a town this size is ridiculous and on top of that they close at pm on most days except Thursday. There really wasnt all that much for my  and half year old to do and practically nothing for my crawling  month old except for this tiny padded area with very few toys in it. So I end up carrying the  month old most the time which is not a pleasant experience since he wants to explore. My  and a half year old will play on the lowest lever for a while but the art room and upper floors are completely lost on him. Im also surprised they dont have more stuff for them to climb on and pretend with. Seems too limited to me. Parking is an ordeal on most day and when ever I think about going back I end up deciding its not worth the effort.
0,"This is really a . stars for food. . stars for terrible, TERRIBLE service and cramped dining area.nnHad reservations last Saturday night party of .  When we arrived our table wasnt ready, which was fine, but my relative, who is wheel chair bound really had nowhere to wait for  minutes since it was really busy that night.  They tell us to wheel her to an area adjacent to the host stand.  A few minutes pass and my fiance gets reprimanded by two different servers that we cannot stand there.  We were not blocking the path to the computers, either. AND WE WERE TOLD TO WAIT THERE! nnWe get seated shortly after that, and we make it easy and order the classic family style dinner for everyone.   salads,  appetizers,  entrees, and  desserts.  Honestly, it is so much food, you are better off getting things a la carte for the table.  For  per person, what you get is really greasy, overly cheesed, americanized Italian food, with most of the pastas arriving to the table over cooked, dining area very very cramped and so loud you will lose your voice, and just soso servers. I understand it being busy, but I have been here several times in the past few years, and this always seems to be the case. You would think with a large party you would at least come by to check on drinks.  I sat with my cocktail glass empty after my first one and I saw empty water and drink glasses all around. nnSalmon is okay, so is the fried mozzarella app,the chicken parm, and the apple dessert.  The veal and mushroom ravioli has a funky mushroom flavor and a cream sauce that is a little salty and very heavy, blegh, soggy salads. blegh.nnIf you have a larger party, request the private rooms in the back, that is much quieter, otherwise you will feel like someone is about to hit the back of your chair the entire meal."
0,"Being totally honest here. I went in on a Sunday, my Dr. wasnt in. Thats where the one star comes in for being open on a Sunday! Registered on line so I didnt  have to wait in the office, that was am. The got back to me and said to come in at . They didnt see me until after .   They say many places in their office to register on line avoid all the waiting yada yada yada. Finally, I was seen and I said I was ill and think I might have had food poisoning, she said well give you Ciprofloxacin for a week. I was in there for severe diarrhea the major side effect from Cipro is... diarrhea.  I wasnt aware of that at the time. I also found out I was never seen by a Doctor, it was a nurse fpn who saw me, didnt ask what I ate or anything and prescribed the meds. I told her I didnt know for sure what I have and she said well this is how we treat  E coli. I didnt know you could tell you had Ecoli by looking at someone!!! Needless to say I got worse after  days I called my dr. who was out of town it was a Friday so I had no choice but to call Nextcare back and said I need to speak to a doctor now. I waited  hours for a call back. When you call you do not get directly to the office, its a call center or something. I told them the diarrhea was worse could they prescribe something different? I waited and waited on the phone finally they said by the way it was not a doctor I was speaking to it was someone in the office no you have to finish the antibiotic and also eat a clear fluid diet for the next  hours. If not better call your physician to be seen. I was so upset at this point and sick and thinking this is just wrong. I did the clear liquids and finished the meds and honestly I was so sick. I got in to see my family dr. on  a Monday he said they dont prescribe something like cipro unless you have been ill like that for about  days at least, without testing me they didnt know what they were treating me for anyhow. Then he tells me that if I didnt need Cipro, which he didnt seem to think I did, he thinks it was a stomach flu viral, not bacterial you can become seriously ill from taking that antibiotic. You can get Cdif. I wont go into details but it is a very serious condition! So the medicine they gave me made me worse.   I am hoping this all clears up for me and just wanted to write this review to let you know before you go in there. Too many mistakes for me, I take my health seriously and I think they should too. I will never go back to this place, never."
0,"Could be the worst bar I have ever been to.  The music is terrible, the service is awful and unfriendly.  I get the feeling that the staff here hates their job.  nnI wish I could nominate McFaddens for the worst of Yelp!nnI dont think this place would even still be in business if it werent in such a busy area."
0,The owners need to visit Berns Steakhouse in Tampa to see how a real steakhouse is run.  Steaks are tasty but ours werent cooked as ordered medium rare and the rest of the food was just soso.  Very pricy for a mediocre meal. Service was okay but nothing special.  Oysters Rockefeller were good but sautueed mushrooms were awful.  We wont be back.
0,"Went in for my upgrade and was seriously overcharged. Their day trial comes with a  restocking fee, which is never disclosed.  I have been on the phone for over two hours between Verizon and Diamond Wireless, and the whole thing is a joke.  I was upsold a jet pack in order to help me on my bill, which I didnt even want, and  I was literally hassled by the sales guy when I returned it.  After receiving my bill with Verizon, I found out they never even cancelled the serviceeven though they are in possession of the jet pack.  To top it off, Verizon has no specifics on how they sell the servicejust a total bill. nn I disagree with previous posters that the sales guys there do not liethats all they did from the time I walked up to the kiosk.  I now have an almost  bill from their ridiculousness, and the call center was nothing but combative and rude when trying to handle the issue."
0,"Blah. Went there for lunch and it seemed it was all about cutting costs and saving money. Lunch special was full of upcharges...just charge a dollar more for the special to begin with instead of having the little note that says this and that and the other will cost you a dollar more. A sashimi platter would be nice as well. The spicy tuna roll was good but the rest just seemed like fluff. A potsticker that was chewy and a spring roll that was laden with grease. Perhaps it was just an off day with the food, but the menu could use some revamping."

0,Rosie is an excellent server! We look forward  to coming into the restaurant but for about the last  months the food has not been up to standards we have seen in the past. The pizza is way too saucy and has too much corn meal on the bottom. We are regular visitors to this Rosatis but our last  visits have not been the same as we experienced in the past. Has management changed or are there new cooks? We want rosatis to return to what real Chicago style pizza is suppose to be! I hope the kitchen can work out the flaws!!!
0,If it was an option not to give any stars this place would get zero. I didnt even get to try the food and will say that I never will. I was meeting my Dad and brother for lunch and was very excited to try this place out. There was a  min wait and we had no problem waiting. I waited for  mins and my Dad arrived with my autistic little brother. We were about to be seated. My Dad brought my brother is own food which happened to be McDonalds fries and a drink because thats the only thing he will eat. They would not seat us because he had McDonalds. They said it was a health code issue and he had to finish it before we sat down. My Dad clearly stated he was autistic and the only way for us to all enjoy a meal together was if he had his McDonalds. We were going to be paying customers. My brother is very well behaved. So we left and tool our money else where. My mind is blown. We were denied services because my  year old Autistic brother had special eating habits. What if you have a child with allergies would they to be denied to eat at a family restaurant because they had to bring outside food with them so he could eat with the family. Baby food? Thats outside food too... I saw lots of babies there that Im sure had baby food. Horrible costumer service.
0,"First impression not so great. Two ladies working the counter. One was ranting about something to what appeared to be a regular customer. And I do mean ranting... Fbombs were dropped. Im not above swearing, but I know better than to do it in front of a customer. She couldnt be arsed to stop long enough to take my order I was the only other customer in there... its not like there was a line, and didnt ask until my order was nearly complete if I was being taken care of. The lady that did take my order was less than friendly. She warmed up to me as she wrapped up my order, but by then the first impression had already been made.nnI ordered half a roast beef sandwich with a garden salad. The sandwich itself was good  bless them for using real cheddar and fresh lettuce. It did taste homemade, which is what they promised, but it also means that I could just make the same thing at home if I really wanted to, so its nothing really special either. I was just thinking that I might give the Lunch Bag another try next time I was in the area when I looked down and saw a dark spot on the bread. Im not gonna say it was mold... but Ive never seen that kind of coloring on a piece of sourdough. I tossed the rest of the sandwich  for better or for worse, I had already finished most of it. The salad, at least, was decently fresh I wasnt totally sure about the tomatoes and the poppyseed dressing was absolutely delicious... but I am almost entirely certain I wont be back. I dont often eat out for lunch, but the Lunch Bag is close to my nearest post office, so they could have had a regular customer... but they missed their shot.nnToo bad, cause their cookies looked awesome."
0,"I really hate to give such a low score but it was truly THAT bad. We stayed at the Red Rock for a little get away for my Birthday. For our first night we decided to treat ourselves to a nice steak dinner at TBones. Bad idea we received  worth of salt and terrible service. We had a drink in the bar first then requested a table. We were less than thrilled when they sat us in the bar but were pretty easy to please so we went with it. The server took her time to greet us and rushed us through our order as if we were inconveniencing her. We ordered the Steak House Salad, Broccoli, Mushrooms, garlic mashed potatoes and  small cut filet mignons. The salad came out with the wrong dressing. The waitress took it back and it was back out pretty quick. It was really great once it was corrected and sadly was the best part or our meal. The waitress asked if we would like bread, however, this did not come out until right as our meal was arriving. The steaks and sides came out but we were given augratin potatoes instead of broccoli. The food runner quickly corrected this however, our waitress was nowhere to be found. The first bite of the filet was fantastic but as we each got to our second and third we could barely get through the rest of the steak. It was so salty! Even the garlic mash and the mushrooms were unbearably salty. The manager asked how everything was as he was walking by and no joke did not stop as he asked. I began to speak and let him know but he interrupted and said great! and kept walking. Our waitress finally came by and at this point we just wanted to get out of there! We gave her our card and she came back with the check but not after she seemed completely inconvenienced by us asking her to box our left overs. As if it could worse, she charged us for the broccoli AND the augratin potatoes! I had to waive her down from another table and she ran off to fix it but apparently was unable to reverse the charge so after  minutes of waiting at the table she gave us  in cash. I understand this is nit picky but what about the tax that we paid? Sure its only a dollar but when we dropped over  for a terrible dinner and even worse service that dollar counts! We are extremely happy to drop money on a steak dinner,in fact we went to SW Steakhouse a few nights later and it was spectacular, but this was just a joke. Spending that much money I expect good service we shouldnt feel like we are stressing our waitress out and not feel completely miserable due to our meal being so salty. All around a bad experience."
0,"Its not the food that made me not want to eat here ever again, its the service. Twice Ive been here and they fk up my order every time.nnThe first time I went, I asked for the glutton free crust pizza. We basically ate the whole pizza and found out later we got the regular crust. The place was pretty much empty on a week day for lunch, so why was service so slow? We had to ask several times for water and basically didnt get any.nWhen I asked for a box, he took my plate of leftovers and never returned. A new server came out and I asked her where is my leftovers? She said Im sorry they threw it awaynBecause I like the food so much and the alternatives that they offer I decided to give it another try.nnWe went again for lunch and asked for the pizza with Vegan cheese. A long dark haired woman with fluffy eyelashes was polite and cheery. But her pleasant attitude didnt mean much when, again the cheese was wrong and we ate a whole pizza with the wrong cheese. I was dissatisfied with the salad drenched in dressing that it was just overly saturated and soupy from the dressing.nnAfter explaining to her that I was experiencing a stomach ache and was upset she gave us the wrong cheese, she didnt call for a manager. Instead she hands me a coupon for a free appetizer with a purchase of an entree. nnWhy do you even offer alternatives for people who have food allergies when your servers dont even pay attention to things that are serious like that? Take it off the menu if your servers dont seem to give a rats ass."
0,Please do not choose this pediatric clinic!! My daughters pediatrician is Dr Peterson and she has been with her since the day she was born. Thats the only reason why we chose to stay. nOut of all the staff members I think we only like  girl and we just tolerate her. The staff in the front office in the receptionist area are terrible!!! They are always messy and disorganized but none of them look like they care. I knew I was going to have a problem with them since the first time I called to schedule an Appointment. When we showed up they didnt have an record of me scheduling and appointment and even my husband got mad at me!! Ever since then Ive had issues. I drop off  papers for them to fill out so I can put my daughter in day care. There were no patients in the waiting room and they told me it would be ready the next day and they would call me. I called  days after not hearing from them. I spoke to  different people and one thought I needed a translator. No one knew what I was talking about!! So they said they would have paper work I needed for daycare whenever I came in. I gave them more than an hour!! I show up and no paper work was filled out!!! They only returned  papers! They said they were busy but its not my problem that they procrastinate! Unprofessional!! They do not care here! Honestly the pediatricians are not even worth the hassle!! Just choose a different one please!! We are already in the process!
0,"made a onenight return visit to the montelucia, a year after our first wonderful experience, to celebrate our wedding anniversary again. this time, it just wasnt as good. i guess the honeymoon is over.nnour room, on the ground level near the oasis pool, was kind of dreary. even with lights on, it just seemed dark.nnthe service at the kasbah pool was HORRIBLE. we arrived and it literally took  minutes before a server came near us...and then she looked right at my husband  RIGHT AT HIM  then turned and walked the other way. he was so pissed. he went over to the towel area and asked one of the employees if he could send someone over to help us...and we waited. and waited. finally, my husband walked across the pool to the nearby lounge to get us a bucket of beers. it wasnt until a  hour later that another server came over and we had to ASK for a pitcher of water which everyone else was served immediately upon arrival.nndespite these disappointments that tarnished my fond memories of our first stay, there were a few shining things. the food at prado seems to have improved since last year. granted, this year we opted to eat just small plates for dinner, so we got to taste a number of really tasty things. i highly recommendnn hummus, which is served beautifully with veggies and flatbread crackersn caramelized cauliflower n stone fruit saladnnskip the calamari. for the price, the portion is small. and its too salty.nnin the morning, i grabbed a latte and blueberry scone from crave and spent two glorious hours at the oasis pool the adults only pool. that pool has beautiful views of camelback mountain and was less crowded than the kasbah pool. oh, and the very nice pool guy found my flipflops that i accidentally left the night before. one too many glasses of wine, and whoops, there go the flipflops!nni really do love the architecture and decor of this resort and would like to give it one more chance. hopefully next time ill be dazzled again, just like the first time, and this second visit will fade into the abyss of my memory."
0,"I have NOT had my nails done here  I wanted to because of a killer Groupon deal... But I called multiple times to make an appointment and no one ever answers the phone. I left  messages and I finally got a call back about a week after my first message. When I answered he demanded I have my groupon voucher information out and ready. I told him I would pull it up and he said Just call me back when you have it ready  I have  other calls to make. I told him it would just be a minute and he insisted I should call back because Im sure it will take several minutes and you dont understand how busy I am. Well I immediately called groupon and insisted I be refunded because the worst customer service I have ever received. They refunded me back in Groupon Bucks, which I will be using at another nail salon. I will absolutely NEVER go to Artistry Salon  no matter what deal is offered. No one should treat their paying customers that way."
0,"Been to PC for lunch a couple of times and it was OK, so tried it with my family for dinner, Very disappointing. The cost for dinner for four with appetizers and entrees, but no drinks, we all had water, was a ridiculous . When you consider the Formica tables with no linens and they cant even be bothered to set the table. The hostess just showed up with cheap stainless utensils wrapped in a napkin. Overall the service was at best mediocre, and thats generous. As for our food again there wasnt much better. The arugula and spinach salad was drenched in oil. The menu says the lettuce wedge comes with a blue cheese vinegarette, instead it came with a creamy dressing that tasted like it came from a bottle.   The only bright spot was that the prawns on the pasta were huge although a bit over cooked.nOverall, youre better off at Applebees and save your money for dessert elsewhere."
0,"Two star only because my waitress wasnt a b and the cheese dip was good. nnThis place is like walking into a frat house. The seats felt rather sticky, pretty gross. And since it was dark at night, you dont know what the heck are on those leather. Service was super slow. The waitresses definitely has something to showcase. My guy friends were definitely starring lmao! nnI came here for a friends bday. The outside patio was packed. Inside was loud, but they played great music. The food, besides the cheese dip is nothing to be raving about. My tamale was dry and overcooked. Either that or it was frozen o.o Guacamole was alright. Salsa was good. Basically foods were meh. Drinks were good though. I dont think Id come back unless its for a friend or something. Definitely not my type of scene xD"

0,"The customer service sucks. I got my eye tested on August , . I got my glasses online from another place in September , . My right is blurry looking out of my new glasses. I take them in and ask to check the prescription and the say the new glasses are correct. I ask them to check my PD cause I think they were wrong. Yup they were. So I ask them to recheck my eyesight but no since its passed  days I have to pay again. How does my eyesight change in  days? I dont think Ill recommend this place or ever go back.  This one is located off th Ave and Union Hills. nI went to Nationwide in Anthem and they were way more accommodating. I will defiantly go back to them. They rechecked my eyes and the doctor explained everything."
0,I love chicken wings but the wings they use here are a bit too small. The boneless chicken wings is the best way to go even though it looks like chicken nuggets. The variety of sauces are pretty good. This may be the only thing that redeems this place. Everything is ala carte which means expensive for bar food. For the price...not worth it for me . Just buy your favorite  sauces and cook your own wings at home.
0,"There isnt anything special about this place. The parking is limited  tight, very tight. The service was disappointing. I had never been there  didnt know what to order. The guy just stood there like he was annoyed. I asked whats on the burritos  he says just meat, rice  beans. I asked for fajita vegetables  he said we dont have those so I just ordered the chicken tacos. They dont come with sour cream, thats  cents extra. They were watery  very bland. Basically like something I could have easily cooked at home. My husband ordered the burrito  said the same, very bland  full of rice. He had to keep dumping salsa on each bite just for flavor. The booths are covered in duct tape to hide holes. Maybe its supposed to be art? I cant understand what people like about this place. There are plenty of good burrito places out there."
0,"Ive been here a few times when it first opened and a few times inbetween classes. Im not a coffeedrinker, so I cant judge on that ground because I wouldnt know good coffee if it bit me on the ass.nnWhat I would know is good hot chocolate, good pastries, and good smoothies.  aint bad, I guess.nnThe hot chocolate Ive had from here tastes much like Starbuckss in that it tastes like its been sitting in the machine for far too long and burnt somehow. Its got a very succinctly plain and charred taste that makes you want to mouthwash furiously to get the taste out of your mouth. Its not appeasing and even though they say they add steamed milk to it, it does nothing to help the taste.nnThe pastries are decent nothing to write home about, but itll do in a pinch. Ive had the chocolate candies they get from a local store cannot remember the name for the life of me, and theyre pretty good. I got a Mimosa flavored chocolate and it tasted pretty authentic. I was very pleased. Ive also had their cheesecake marble muffin whichhonestly would be better if it got rid of so much of the chocolate cake. Its not bad, but the chocolate cake is a little bland in taste that youd rather just eat the top and toss the rest.nnTheir smoothies though are wonderful. I cant judge for the nondairy, but the yogurtbased smoothie is amazing. I always get the strawberry and it has a very fresh despite the fact they use frozen strawberries and tart taste that really makes your tastebuds pop.nnThe atmosphere is nice too a little small, but theres seating outside and inside and its very comfortable. Great if youre a blogger or just want to do your homework in a different place rather than your apartmentdorm or library.nnIf youre going to come here for reasons other than coffee or atmosphere, come for the smoothies."
0,Alright sooo I have a buddy in Vegas who claimed that this place was the shit and way better than Boiling Crab and Claws out here in Orange County so I had to put it to the test. Took a trip to Vegas with a group of our friends and decided to have dinner with one of my friends friends who said we could try this place. nnWhen we got there it looked to be pretty busy with a fifteen to twenty minute wait which wasnt to bad. The host was pretty cool and talked to us for a bit while we waited for our table. We finally got seated and ordered right away. It pretty much took them  minutes or more for them to come out and let us know that our food was going to be coming out a little late due to the rush they had.  minutes after that was when our food came out. The sauce was good but a bit watery. The shrimp was perfect and not over cooked. The service was alright with the waiter coming to check on his here and there. As I was eating one of the remaining shrimp that was left in the bag I noticed a thick black hair on the head of the shrimp. Normally I would think it was just the whiskers or whatever you want to call it from the shrimp but NO it was straight up a pubic hair with the little white thing on bottom tip of it from wherever the hair was from. My friend decided to take the piece of shrimp with pube still on it up to the front and complain. The asshole Caucasian male waiter gave her attitude and claimed it wasnt hair and that it was one of the whiskers from the shrimp. He said that the hair wasnt purely black and that there was a redish color to it which was bull shit. So my friend came back to sit down with us and was irritated with the waiter for handling the situation the way he did. The host that was talking to us before we got seated walked by and we showed him the hair and even he himself knew it was a piece of hair. He joked around and said well thats obviously not my hair. and laughed because he had a buzzed head. He finally took care of the situation and took the order of shrimp off the bill for us and apologized. nnOverall... place is over priced compared to what the Cali prices are. The sauce is not too bad but not what I imagined it to be after all the hype. And lastly the service sucked balls but the only thing that made up for it was the host who was nice enough to help us out. Would I go back there ever again? Absolutely not!
0,"horrible! crowded. tables are so close you rub elbows. poor service. boring food. ridiculous prices for what they offer. i actually saw a woman in a white dress at the table next to us being served a plate that had the sauce dripping from it needless to say, her dress was ruined and she wasnt happy, they walked out. the sommelier was nowhere to be found. our food came out before our appetizer. the best experience of the entire evening was the busser, he removed our plates right away...its a shame our dessert took half an hour to arrive and no it wasnt even a souffle. horrible!"
0,"Nothing too crazy here from what I see.  I gather it can however, get a tad bit wild during the weekends and especially around ASU.  nnOverall, food was okay at best.  The salsa that came with the chips had too much lime.  Tasted like lime juice and the chips were store bought.  nnI ordered the crunchy fish tacos.  Crunchy indeed it was, but again whats up with the lime.  I added a little bit on my tacos and again it was too much.  The guacamole sauce atop wasnt bad, but my tacos were overly seasoned already.  The crunchiness was there along with the cabbage mellowing it out that was a nice welcome.  The rice and beans were out of a can as expected.  In the end, probably come for drinks but thats about it.  Enjoy!"

0,"Nice new office, clean, had po box available. At times you can wait a long time in line, but guess that is the case at all post offices. They have a self serve area but there is often a line there as well. Counter people are luck of the draw, some bend over backwards others are out the door at five ofifteen seconds. Had a really bad experience express mailing a passport. They misplaced the package and because their system is batch updated at the end of the day, they could not tell us where it was. They gave my daughter bad info when she called to find out about it and when i went in, their answer was to just hang out a couple days and it should show up. Losing a passport is a really big thing and i would have appreciated them acting like it was. At least UPS and FedEx can tell you where your package was last seen. They did refund the cost of postage, big deal.nnWhat keeps them from earning one star is i went in to buy stamps for a mail out. One of the counter people advised us to bring in an invitation we were preparing to send out so they could make sure we were getting proper postage. I just weighed it and thought i knew what we needed but with the new regulations and charges....not so. That potentially saved us some grief so two stars instead of one."
0,"Since moving to AZ, I have tried a few different salons and yearn for my place back home.  But this place was recommended so I thought why not?nnI will say off the bat it is the cleanest salon I have been in since I arrived in AZ.  sterile equipment. Nothing reused.  Kudos to them.nnAnd I will say that the owner and his wife seem genuinely friendly.nnAnd the place is busy.  nnBut I got THE worst gelish job ever.  My nails were a little longer than I liked so I told the worker that I keep them a little shorter.  And i was getting ill from the fumes so i didnt pay as much attention as i should have   I thought she squared off my beautifully rounded nails a little short but that can happen first time someone new does your nails.  But the corners were so sharp, my hubs howled and said they were lethal weapons.  Then, to make matters worse, the gelish was over my fingertips and under my nails.  So now I have polish stuck to my skin and it is not going to come off easily I fear.  And to be honest, they look like crap.  It s the first bad French mani I have ever had.nnMaybe if I had the owner or his wife, I would try again but I dont think so."
0,"I have heard great things about this but we didnt have a good experience.  We went for my birthday PM. We were seated quickly in a back room and the st server was pleasant. Thats where things went wrong. While we went off to the salad bar, we were told bread, water, etc. would be brought to our table. We returned  mins later, no water, no bread, no server to be found. Eventually, a young server happened upon our table and was surprised we had no bread, water or PLATES. Went off to see too it. Another  or  similar visits and someone else asked us if we needed something. I said, yup, water, bread and PLATES we still couldnt have any of the meat coming around as we had no where to put it and a manager.  The manager arrived and asked what we needed and, well, yeah, had to point that out to him too as if it wasnt pretty clear we had no plates after  mins sitting there with nothing to do but toy with the salad scraps.  Off he went.... more time passed and eventually we got the water, bread and some plates bit by bit. One would think he would have quickly resolved this but nope. BTW Skip the bread or whatever those round balls of doughy things were in the basket. nnThe meats.... most of them were dry and they cut pieces off the outsides which were hard crust. There were two that were fairly good rib eye and top round and my dinner companion enjoyed the pork encrusted with parm. By the time we were situated, the servers had stopped making the rounds in the back two rooms.  Most everyone leftnnOne most interesting things was at one point, our server young maybe s I swear his picture is the one in the additional tips for the business offered...get rid of him that was supposed to bring a plate was so busy chatting and flirting with a couple at another table he was there a good  mins and over and over  taking a business card from the female and the rest of the servers who were not making the rounds with meats were grouped in a bunch talking... it was a wonder the manager didnt make some effort to stop the behaviors.  The server with the plate in his hand finally managed to drop it in front of me without even looking down at us or saying a word before running back to his discussion across the room.  Me, I would have fired him on the spot as it was THAT BAD.nnSalad bar  lame at best. It looked nice but not really much to speak of for such a huge place that is highend pricewise. For instance, the tomatoes were a main item  they shouldnt have been served they were so under ripe  just one example.nnSides   Slapped down like an after thought on our table  Mash potatoes that were horrible  had to be from freeze dried. For that matter, the mash potatoes from freeze dried at the market are better by a factor of .  Whats with you  Fogo de Chao!nnHonestly, I cant imagine that the review I saw here relate to the food in this place. Just because they have a lot of different meats  we were told does not make a place a good value or the food well prepared. nnI could not WAIT to get out of there and wrote HORRIBLE SERVICE on the check. My comment was we could have eaten at one of the very best steak places in the valley for the same price range compared to this horrible servicefood that was equal to a buffet line and meat that shouldnt have been served in  times out of  samples we had. I left with a greasy feeling in my stomach.nnThe worst highlight  sitting without plates for  mins. and the manager having to be asked if he saw anything particularly wrong with that.  Sitting there in an almost empty room  tables out of  and NO servers coming around. Watching one of the waiters talk to a female guest at a table for what seemed like all evening at various points  I hope she has a job for you because if your management sees your behavior, hopefully, they get rid of you before they lose any more customers.nnKeep in mind that this is not a  dinners for  special. This is a  a person plus extras Scottsdale higher end eatery.  Although, it was worse than Applebees and that is saying A LOT.nnNEVER again."
0,"King crab legs, lobster were absolutely dry. Had to dip in butter to get meat out. Snow  Dungeness crab not fresh at all. Meat fell apart, was not firm at all  very difficult to get out of shells. I eat out alot, I know good, fresh, and firm seafood and there was none here.  bucks for  wasted."
0,I will equate our dining experience at Pizzeria Bianco to that of the election of Obama.  All media hype and sensationalism perpetuated by treehugging democrats frankly I would be shocked if my husband and I werent the only two customers there high on pot.  The pizza is NOTHING to be impressed by as are the greasy goat cheese appetizers.  We waited two hours to eat the best pizza in the US and Oprahs favorite pizza.  Please.  The ONLY thing that this place has going for it is its atmosphere and its wait staff.  We will not be going back and I shall forever feel sorry for the people who continue to waste their lives away by waiting  to  HOURS to eat salty pizza which is too thin to support a teaspoon of sauce before it turns limp and soggy and who profess its brilliance to everyone not fallen under its spell.
0,Came here with the fabulous Jessica Y. see review below.nnFirst off..I totally understood why there was no wait on a Saturday night. This place is located in a really random section of the hotel. Maybe people got lost trying to find the buffet?nDinner was . which is a little cheaper than say Bellagio or the Wynn.nThe first thing I noticed was the swanky interior. It matches the hotel in that everything is very modern.nnI knocked off a star for the food selection. I really thought there was not enough options. I usually go to the Bellagio or Wynn buffet and I usually come back with a FULL plate every time. At the Wicked Spoon...I kept staring at everything and just thought....meh.nThey give you little potspans instead of letting you scoop things until you realize you have  little potspans on your plate and no room for anything else. Those suckers take up space and they slide around your plate.nnI knocked off another star cause the food I got...I didnt like.nI like my buffets with a mix of familiar and gourmet...but this place tried to be all fancy schmancy and failed at making the food taste good. The pizzas particularly looked really flat and unappetizing.nnI knocked off another star for their desserts. I am a girl and desserts mean everything to me when it comes to meals. No matter how full I am I will always have a FULL plate of desserts. All the stuff they had though was just so....safe and boring and repetitive. Chocolate covered strawberry or apple. Ice cream. A few cakes. How boring. How lame.nnIn all my years coming to Vegas I ate the least here. I couldnt find anything and the dessert area made me sad.
0,"I have been to various Jasons Deli locations throughout the U.S., and they just never seem to satisfy.  Most of the time, they mess up my order.  I can only recall one time when Ive escaped Jasons Deli without some kind of incident or mistake.  And whats the deal with the gazillion tables in this place???  nnPlus one star for the graham crackers you can find on the salad bar.  Their graham crackers kick butt.  I dont know what they do to them, but theyre better than any other Ive had.  Its everything I can do not to stuff my purse full of graham crackers and live off them for a few weeks.  Seriously.  Try the graham crackers.  Really... try them.  Really.  I mean it."
0,"My Wife and I had dinner there, very colorful place at first, seemed like itd be good. They model themselves after a real Mexico City restaurant, and Im not sure what thats all about! Food was bland and boring, and I didnt find it to be authentic at all. Service was OK, it was very crowded, but that didnt hinder the waitress. Wont be going back."
0,"exactly what the stars say. MEH. i realize that it is just mcdonalds, but i have definitely experienced better. everytime i come through here the employees are very monotonous and the fries are cold. seriously, the fries are the best part of mcdonalds the least you could do is give me a decent order of hot, salty deliciousness!"
0,We made an order for a pizza with suicide fries. We ordered it online. We waited  minutes before driving so when we got there we would expect to only wait about  more minutes or so. When we got there they said they just were starting the order. I asked how long it would take. The lady said she did not know since they just ran out of cheese...nWe told them to cancel it and left
0,We ordered pizza today for lunch in our dental office.  The doctor was eating and a piece of glass was in the pizza.  They offered to return the money never did.  I dont recommend going to this store.
0,"Ive eaten here several times over the past few months, and have generally been impressed by the quality of the food and service. However, on my most recent trip, my experience left a bit to be desired. The teenager making my sandwich ignored my request to leave the onions off of my sandwich or couldnt hear my response over the loud music, and didnt confirm, and when I took it back up to get it remade without onions, they simply picked the onions out and put it on a new sub roll and of course missed some in the process. In my many years eating at Quiznos, I have come to expect better service than that, and I will not be returning to this one."
0,Ive been coming to this Starbucks for years Ive always had such a pleasant experience Tiffany the manager has always been so nice to me and my family! But ever since the girl named gray has started working there my experience has been nothing but terrible! She has been rude to me on several occasions Ive complained to the manager and I wont complain to her anymore because I do not want a free drink all Im asking for is for gray to pleasant to me when I go and buy my drink at six am! She has an Issue with me and Im not sure why! She refuses to make my drink right and when I ask her to make it correctly she always come back with a snotty remark she make me feel as if Im a bother to her. I just want one simple thing done I want my drink that I paid for made correctly! Because of the way I am treated by gray I will no longer come to this Starbucks neither will my friends and family I refuse to be treated with such disrespect again!
0,"Went into get my brows waxed and was dissatisfied. The lady who did them was very rushed, like I was bothering her and she needed to do something else. She didnt ask me how I wanted my brows, just proceeded to slap on some wax and yanking the hair away. I ended up with brows that Im not fond of because they are too thin, and to top it off, their price went up from the last time I was there. nnNo more visits there for me."
0,"When I was in Vegas, I was craving Ramen!  I searched on yelp and was amazed by the raving reviews I read about this place.  The restaurant is really small, about  tables plus the bar, so we waited for about an hour in half to be seated.   I ordered the Tonkatsu Ramen and shared the pork belly bowl with my husband.  Their ramen soup wasnt as flavorable as I expected and same goes for their pork belly.  I felt like some ingredients was missing.  Im sad to say that  Ive had better."
0,"We arrived at rehab burger on a Sunday afternoon in late July thought it would be not be crowded, but pretty much every table was taken.  We got seated right away, and the waitress came over pretty quickly.  We asked for water and some time to kook at the menu.  Took a few minutes, but got the water.  My husband ordered the hatch chile medium well with fries and I ordered the byob with mustard and pickles and onion ringsI ordered a glass of wine and my husband ordered a beer.  After a long time  minutes or so the waitress came back with a beer and a mixed drink said no thats not mine and she asked could I repeat my drink order.  I did and about  minutes later it arrived.  And then we waited, and waited and waited.  Finally the food arrived.  Hatch burger medium RARE not well with sweet potato tots not regular fries.  No ketchup aioli instead.  My hamburger arrived with lettuce, tomato, onion, mushroom and pickles, no mustard in sight.  I took it all off and asked the hostess for mustard  which she delivered quickly.  I was also given fries instead of onion rings because according to the waitress they were still in the fryer, and would come out later.  By the time the rings came out I was full and didnt want them.  We then asked the waitress to change our tab due to the problems and she said she would send the manager over.  Well she didnt and we had to ask the hostess to send the manager over.  The manager came over quickly guess the waitress didnt tell her and was very sympathetic and accommodating.  She comped the whole bill, even though we were willing to pay for drinks and things that had gone ok.  I think the waitress was the problem here, not the food or the management, but it was hard to know since we didnt eat much."
0,"I must disagree with the previous review. I went there once and not going back. I know it doesnt sound like a big deal but its pretty disapointing to be served in English when your first language is French. That being said, thats not the reason why I disagree. If youre going to eat lot of stuff, what I always find confusing in Canadian Indian restaurant is somehow the will to blend in Canadian culture and offer a product that is the most true to their uabfood cultureubb as possible. nnLast time I went it was pretty expensive compare to what Ive paid somewhere else. Every plate will cost around , plus a glass of a bottle orange juice is like .. It cost me something like  with tip included and a longggg time waiting. It was just opened and nothing was ready. Pretty disapointing and not really professional when you know youre business open at PM, please prep everything before so you can serve quickly. Maybe I have a large appetite but i still think its a bit expensive for indian food."
0,"This place sucks.  Dont believe the hype, avoid this restaurant like the plague.  First off, this restaurant smells like Donkey poo.  That should be enough to ward ppl off but my friend insisted that I try the Chicken Benedict so we stuck with the plan thats what I ordered.  The platter is HUGE but its all a sham!  The fried chicken patty is covered and smothered with cheese and gravy on top of  humongous biscuits, w a smidget of scrambled eggs, on top of a bed of mashed potatoes.  Scrambled Eggs?  WTH I ordered a frickin eggs benedict.  Not only that, but these were cafeteria eggs.  UGH.  I just got more and more sick from eating this thing.  Besides the fried chicken patty, everything else was just tasteless, dry, uneventful filler.  i hated this dish.  I left more than  quarters on my plate and I showed my waiter how I felt about the meal afterwards photo attached"
0,I gave this location one star because the office staff was kind and efficient. The NP was incompetent and rude. She clearly had not even read  the nurses notes. She was combative the minute she walked in. We waited  hours with an appointment. I will NEVER come back to this place again
0,"Do not go here. Pay a bit more and avoid this place. I should have relied on what I read about this place. I could go on and on, just take my word for it. I contacted the Scottsdale store they were helpful. Stay away from the Tempe store!!"
0,"I have been to lots of nightclubs in Vegas and I am afraid to say that this is the worst of all. I visited this club last weekend Memorial Day and had one of my worst experiences.

0,"I was really craving Chinese food after a long weekend in Vegas filled with drinking, gambling, and general debauchery. In comes Noodle Asia. nnWhat I ended up experiencing was a poor service even though the restaurant was half full b bland food c high prices nnOur server forgot our waters for about  minutes, brought all our meals out at separate times, and took  minutes to pick up our check after she brought it to the tabe. Talk about mind being elsewhere. Actually, let me reprase Our server never came back to get our check, we had to flag the manager down after  minutes of waiting. nnIn terms of food... bleh. I had the broccoli and beef with spring rolls on the side. I can safely say Ive had . Chinese takeout meals that have been way better. The food really had no flavor to it, and I had to douse it with duck sauce and other spices to coax any sort of taste out of the dish. nn Maybe its my strictly American palette, but I think Ive become accustomed to Americanized Asian food and get really thrown off when authentic Asian food is put in front of me. Who knows? nnWhat I do know is that I wouldnt be back, and would recommend all Vegasgoers to skip over Noodle Asia in favor of the food court nearby."
0,"I really dont expect much out of a foodcourt place, but even so, this place was pretty disappointing.nnFirst off, I was planning on ordering a brisket plate with macandcheese and hushpuppies, and an iced tea. They were out of brisket, out of macandcheese, and had discontinued the hushpuppies even though they were still on the menu. Oh yeah, and there was no iced tea and no ice they did refill the ice. So zero percent of what I wanted was available.nnI ended up ordering pulled chicken, with mashed potatoes and corn on the cob. The chicken was pretty dry and tasteless, even with the rub, and the sauce was pretty bland. The mashed potatoes were old, and had some kind of weird skin not a potato skin, more like the skin you see on pudding. The corn on the cob was actually ok.nnTo their credit, they did give me a discounted price because of everything being unavailable.nnIf youre stuck eating at the food court at the outlets, Id suggest going to one of the safer places, like the Chinese place, or the sandwich place."
0,"Not my type of place i admit. Went here for a coworkers bday party. huge place. There are three different rooms.. hip hop, countrywhich is the main theme here and the biggest area and a s room. nnThe drink prices are what made the night. We were getting drinks for a buck a piece. Gin and tonics for a buck, yes a buck. nnDue to these lovely economy friendly prices i got tipsy fast and it made the night and this place a whole lot better than i think it would have been if i was sober."
0,"Menu is ok, service is subpar. Waitress Amanda was not pleasant and seemed annoyed to serve my party of four. I have gone to this place a few times before but after tonights experience I will now take my business elsewhere."
0,"Great friendly service, very pleasant and clean atmosphere. I ordered the pho tai beef soup and it came well presented and very tasty. My girlfriend attempted to order pho chay veggie soup but they did not have it on the menu. The server compromised and brought out a very poor bowl of soup with hardly a variety of veggies, just mushrooms and tofu over beef broth and of course the rice noodles. This place has potential but they need to add a pho chay on the menu and get rid of the disposable chop sticks and use plastic ones like in all the good Vietnamese restaurants. There are plenty of other good Vietnamese restaurants to enjoy, just not this one."
0,"The buffett kept me thinking of the movie, Supersize Me, because everything was so salty, deep fried, or swimming in gravy Although I must give Texas Station kudos for serving Menudo again the Menudo was way too salty. I ended up skipping the buffett and settling for the Grand Cafe where I had omlets. My room made me think of what a halfway house must be like. Do not expect pillowtop mattresses or chocolates. I had to call the front desk three days in a row before the plumber showed up with a bottle of DrainoO to unclog the face bowl drain! I would have checked out after day one but I was attending a class nearby and my room was prebooked. There was a dog obedience conference held at the hotel while I was there. Some of my classmates complained of dogs barking and crying all night!  What ever you do, I suggest not considering this place for a honeymoon otherwise you may endup getting annulled in the morningenuff said"
0,"I had their special  tacos and drink for . I tried the fish, steak, and potato tacos with their homemade salsa. I liked the potato taco not a fan of the fish. The customer service was amazing and I could not have meet better people."
0,"I agree that the clothes are awesome but at this store, the service was very poor.  My wife was looking for some very specific items and couldnt seem to get anyone interested in helping her.  They were not very busy so it seemed the clerks didnt seem to really care much.  The clearance rack was so high up that you couldnt get anything down or even look at it without a ladder.  Not exaggerating. At this price point for clothes I expect better service and someone to pretend to care."
0,Over all it wasnt a very good experience. Its a very noisy place. The service was extremely slow. The waiter obviously didnt want to be there. The drunken bread was decent and different. But the salad had no taste. The chicken Parmesan was over cooked. It was a desert chickenvery dry. Cream brufbluee doesnt have the silky texture. Its very dense and thick.
0,"Was not greeted or assisted when I came in. The place is disorderly and dirty looking. Finally when I figured things out on my own I waited for the ladies to finish their conversation about whatever trivial weekend blunder they were talking about. Kimberly was the raised eyebrow, gum chewing teller indifferent to the clients needs. She input the information from my sheet, and tried to tell me that if the recipient is not there upon first delivery, UPS sends it back to the sender and that I should get additional services added.  Im no shipping pro but obviously they take it back to the nearest UPS store and leave a note at the door.  I then said that I was ok without extra services and said I dont care how it gets there as long as it actually gets there in a friendly way. She then half rolled her eyes and smirked and said I dont care either in a smart a way.  Her smart attitude was a turn off considering Im usually patient with lazy service people. All In all I do not recommend this store I dont feel trustful or secure in sending my important document with them, Im afraid it could get lost now I checked the status I my shipment using the tracking number and it says its not available.  Dont recommend, find another location to ship from."
0,"late night servers were really unprofessional. I mean who carries a martini to a table IN THEIR PALM!? nnThe burger I ordered Medium, came out bright purple and cold inside, I didnt eat it, but the server didnt have the power to take it off my meal... this review was from jan ... maybe things have gotten better"
0,"Customer service was so so. Unfortunately for my girlfriend though, the tattoo work was so so as well. She received one by mark. A simple corvette symbol. The shading is splotchy and the lines are not straight. Disappointing considering how simple of a tattoo it is. Keep shopping."
0,"I have had the absolute worst experience here.  I had been going here a few months, taking a load of dry cleaning in probably once a month.  The last time i went,  I took a Vince silk shirt that had no stains on it, as well as a brand new light pink silk shirt.  Both were very expensive.  When i got them back, there was stains all over the sleeve and back of the Vince shirt, and the same type of stains on the pink silk shirt.  I did not notice until after i took the dry cleaning home, and put each on for the first time, then I went back to see if they could fix it.  Not only did they deny it was even their fault and blamed me for getting things all over each shirt, they denied even remembering the shirt.  And the owner laughed at me.  I am offended by the way the situation was handled, as well as suggesting I would lie about getting something on my shirt and blame it on them.  I did not even mention the fact they had ripped my Theory wool pants two months before, and i didnt complain.  Also, my silk shirt was in such rough shape, the seams pulled apart, and becoming threadbare in places, I cannot believe people go here for dry cleaning.  I know that the stains were caused by dirty PERC the chemical used in cry cleaning, and I know that they should not iron my silk on high heat like they did.  They use dirty PERC to cheap out and save money on the bottom line.  They do not care about anyones clothes.  I would have taken my business elsewhere anyways, but now I want to tell everyone else what awful customer service and dry cleaning this place has."
0,"GAS SCAM nIf you do not have gas receipt, even if gas gage shows full, they will charge you . If you can, show charge on credit card web site, assuming you paid via CC. They will not purpose this solution, just point out fine print in contract."
0,"Wow, dont really know where to start on this place. We decided to go here based on the previous star review plus it was close to our house. Together we ordered the lasagna  chicken parm. Our dinners came w side salads. Heres my issues w the food. Some of the salad was brownfrozen burnt. I heard A LOT of beeping from the kitchen which makes me believe chef Mike microwave was doing the majority of the cooking. My lasagna was extremely over cooked  was mooshy. I did not even want try what my bf got. He said pretty much the same thing about his entree bland and overcooked. The food was warm when it came out. The waitress was nice and friendly. But honestly this place will not make if it continues to run this way."
0,"Very friendly but the wash service was definitely lacking. I got the Gold package and there were lots of missed areas, bugs and kind of a halfassed approach to the cleaning details inside and out.nnIll give them one more shot after so many other positive reviews but the first go around wasnt very impressive.  stars it is for Meh, Ive experienced better. because I have, lots better.nnPLEASE READ! The CEO, Tim Bolton, responded to my review with a very apologetic letter and is in the process of making it right. I am highly impressed by his customer service and will definitely be giving them another shot along with updating my review after my next visit."
0,"I just had a terrible first experience here. We went on a Monday afternoon, ordered a bagel bucket. The girl getting our bagels insisted that we could only choose , I had to point to the menu to show her that the bucket has . Their bagels were smaller than normal Einsteins and very overbaked, burnt in spots.nnThey had a pay pass for the credit card, so my husband did that as I handed her our coupon he was a little overeager to use the pay pass. The older cashier woman said that as soon as it registered the credit card, the transaction was complete and she couldnt take my coupon. I asked if she could void it, and she said to just use the coupon next time. I told her Id really like to use it now we dont go that often, and she said it would be a hassle for her records to do the refund. I asked if she could please do it anyways, and she did very grumpily. We had to sign the refund receipt before she redid the transaction, and when asked if she had a pen she replied No, we dont have any pens. What business doesnt have a pen? So I fish through my purse and finally found a pen. She also wouldnt let me use my  gift card AND a  off coupon, I had to choose which one I wanted to use. I wasnt sure when she was finished with the second transaction, because she didnt say ok, thank you, or anything.nnSome of the WORST customer service I have ever experienced. Save yourself a hassle and go down to the Einsten on Chandler Blvd. by . Whoever is managing this place needs to really focus on their customer service, and I am not surprised why business there is incredibly sparse."
0,"Boo.... I was super excited to try this place because it is near my house and it got good reviews, but was unfortunately disappointed.   First off, they need to update their website, they do not have delivery. I ordered cheese enchiladas with rice and beans and my boyfriend ordered a red chili burrito and chicken taco.   We both had the red sauce and it was burnt... so bad that I had to scrape it off to even have a few bites, then I gave up.  His burrito tasted burnt too, which meant it was the sauce not the entruee itself.   Their beans were pretty dry and nothing to get excited about.   BF did like the chicken taco, he said the shell was crispy but not greasy. Their chips and salsa were good, spicy but good.    Overall, I had a bad experience because the only thing I ordered was burnt, I think I would try it one more time, but next time in the restaurant, that way if it is bad, I can get my money back!"
0,"Were die hard Fatburger fans and stop in every time were in Las Vegas.  Tonight we stopped in and found that the place has been completely renovated  no issue with that, it looks a lot better.  nThe only thing that was not better was the food!  The decline in quality was not what we expected but neither was the sharp increase in prices!   bucks for  burgers and fries is too much to pay for a strip mall burgers.  nWe wont be back anytime soon."
0,"Im not usually the biggest fan of Ra to begin with but we go there every now and then for Happy hour for sushi.  We decided to go to the Awhatukee location this time instead of Tempe.  Parking is usually crazy because they share it with a movie theater and other businesses. nnWe were seated and ordered our drinks and all was well.  We ordered our food and we ordered  rolls.  It took them  minutes to bring out our rolls when we were starving.  They never take that long and it was just unacceptable.  Every time we asked our server to bring us something we knew it was going to take him  minutes to come back with it.  Our daughter was waiting for her cheater chopsticks so she could eat with us, and that took forever. Same with our bill etc. It was a pain in the ass.  Their rolls are pretty mediocre anyway.  They are never rolled tightly and they are tiny.  I dont think we will be visiting a chain like this in a while.  We will stick to a mom and pop sushi restaurant."
0,"the food quality was good but their service was terrible. it was so slow and they wouldnt come by with the carts they were just standing around and talkin among each other the workers we paid out bill and was waiting for the change.. and she took so long just talking with the cashier, we were like forget it. then we said just keep the tip and when we walked to the door the cashier said,  see i told you, you make them wait you get more tip i was so pissed never again going there"
0,This facility is by far the absolute worst family practice ever!!!! I would avoid this place at all costs. There has been  Dr.s that have even decided to leave and practice elsewhere because of how poorly this facility is ran. The remaining Dr.s absolutely suck right along with the administration as well! I was there with my wife and daughter just for a referral to a dermatologist for our daughter and the Dr. ended up calling my wife stupid all because she called a P. A. a Dr. Half the time their staff doesnt even know whats going on there either. We finally had enough with this facility when we called to schedule an appointment for one of our children to be seen and they told me that the Dr. was no longer seeing children. RIDICULOUS!! this is a FAMILY PRACTICE!!! so i thought! I then called administration and the director and the Dr. denied that! They are absolutely ridiculous there and incompetent with doing there job! We unfortunately were patients there far too long!  No longer!  AVOID!!!!!
0,"Well as luck would have it my wife decided that she wanted to go back for dinner tonight. I brought a pair of reading glasses so I could finally take a look at their beerwine list. nnI ordered the Irish Onion Soup  the Irish Nachos. My wife ordered the Spud Soup  a Cobb Salad. Strangely enough the soups were brought out first then the nachos  the salad.The nachos were meh tasting. I think the only flavor came from the extra jalapenos I had them put on. My wife wasnt happy with her Cobb salad. Everything we ordered had very little flavor, except for the sweet tea. I think we got the dregs of the sweet tea container with our first glasses. The tea improved throughout the meal.nnI ordered a piece of Key Lime pie for dessert. It had no flavor. But I took the decorative lime slice  squeezed the juice from it out onto the slice of pie. That really woke it up.nnWe both agreed when we left that the meal wasnt anything special. Too bad."
0,"We used to go all the time, but the food sucked, it was a hole and the only good thing we used to say about it was it was a good place to take a sh....nnNow they have let the only cool bartender go because he was a guy. Most of the girls were horrible and not all that to look at. nnPlus they promote the free shuttle, but normally the guy who was suppose to drive it was too drunk to be the driver.nnTime to find a new home in Chandler."
0,"Dont see this show....it is SO boring. I literally was dozing throughout the entire show. We got our tickets from a ridiculous time share presentation were promised Ka and got bated and switched to this POS, so at least we didnt pay for it, but this show was just boring, had no discernable plot maybe an angry fetus? not sure, had no impressive acrobatics...just dont waste your time and money."
0,"Went there for a date night.  We did the call ahead seating which worked out great!!  We got seated at our table and the drink host was fast and efficient.  Our waiter however was not.  We ordered the hot sour soup bowl.  When it came, one of the plastic spoons had a noodle of some kind dried up in it.  I pointed it out to our server and he took the spoon which was in the bowl.  I asked if we could have another complete set.  No apology what so ever.  I had to ask twice for a refill of my soda.  My wife asked how long for a couple spring rolls.  He said  min.   min later he asks if we were ready for desert.  No egg rolls had arrived yet!  He went to get them.  We waited another  min for the check.  Keep in mind all our dishes were picked up.  Finally it came and again no apology for any part of the poor service.  I placed my ccd down and waited..... And waited..... And then some more.  My wife and I gave up and came up with the cash between both of us.  I did have to go to the bar and ask for change.  That part was fast and efficient!  The bartender even picked up I was a little upset.  He asked if I wanted to speak to a mgr but I declined as we just wanted out.  Well a mgr did find us.  She apologized for everything and did a great job.  I just dont think well be going back to that location anytime soon."

For breakfast, I ordered the Breakfast Burrito. Gross doesnt even describe this burrito. It ltasted like cardboard.  Two bites and then I threw in the towel.  Please note my parents raised me not the waste food.  Its a very rare occasion for me to throw so much food away.nnThe reason for the  stars is fast service, nice wait staff, and my dad liked the ribs he ordered for dinner."
0,"We saw the tulips iftaar buffet on tulips Facebook page and went to the restaurant .  was the buffet cost . Bit high for a restaurant in Charlotte . Checked the non veg appetizer chilly chicken . It was hard to eat , tasteless . Chicken biryani taste was missing. Naan wasnt available . Finally paid the bill and came home and drank sprite to fill up my belly . I wouldnt go here after . Please improve the food."
0,"Announcement Were Changing Everything! Our  million transformation is near completion.nnYeah, they kind of need it. Very plain and boring, but it is very clean. The low ceilings were really awkward. Location is not ideal, as its far away from all the good clubs. nnDisclaimer I did not stay here, just strolled through and explored."
0,"Dont waste your time,  BBQ sauce is water with pepper sauce, Ribs have no smoke flavor at all and were not the fall off the bone type.. they had a bit of pull to them, Moist brisket was moist, but again, no smoke flavor, corn was mushy, baked beans taste like Campbells with BBQ sauce added to them, potato salad is bland. Ill go to Toms or Joes until I come on to something better."
0,"The food was meh at best, the service was deplorable. I ordered the chicken fried steak breakfast. First the biscuits came out when they served my fiancue his dinner. Then came the steak and part of the eggs. The remain egg and hash browns came out. By the time I was served my fiancue was nearly finished.  Our waitress left us sitting there long after we had finished eating. When I asked for a to go box, she took my nplate and didnt return for quite a while. When she came back she asked if I wanted a box for my biscuits. I asked where the rest of my meal was and could see immediately on her face she had thrown it away. She then said I thought you only wanted a box for the biscuits. which made no sense. She then left hurriedly and said she would adjust the bill but I would have gladly paid the extra  to leave. Both she and the manager said that they hadnt scheduled a cook and  waiters. The waitress said she was triple booked at her station.  I dont see this as the waitresses issue, but it seemed more like a lot of bad management decisions. What kind of manager has an all you can eat fish fry on a Friday night, and doesnt have all of his staff working? This was our fist and last visit to BBD."
0,"I really wanted to like this place, because all my friends had been and they seemed to like it. I give this place name the fake southern food. nnWe arrived at , parking is to say the least difficult.  At pm we were told it was an hour wait. So I spotted two seats at the bar and snagged them. I asked the bartender if we could eat there and she told us yes.  I ordered the tupelo honey draft, which was great.  Since I was sitting at the bar you would think the service would be great... Not so. She couldnt be bothered with us when I asked what was the best thing on the menu.. She simply said its all good..I dont think shes even eaten the food here we ordered the okra to start. The okra came out pretty fast. I love fried okra, however this was wormy tasting mushy and not at all crisp on the inside. Fail. Wont try it again. Since it was so bland I was hesitant to order dinner and we thought about going some place else. It was filling up in the place the bar barely had standing room, and people were pushing and shoving. Some man came over and asked me if the seat next to me was taken and I said no he proceeded to shove another seat in next to me. If youve been there the bar area itself is small, an extra seat doesnt fit well.  Then the man asked to try my okra! Sure since I was done with it now.. And still waiting to order. Weird.   nnWe got veggie plate and tomato soup and grill cheese. When it finally came, it looked ok. The grill cheese is just grilled cheese on big toast. Bland at best. The tomato soup was barely warm, no worries though because the five people tending bar couldnt be bothered to even ask. The veggie plate with Mac and cheeses, beets, and some kind of roasted collard greens was absolutely nasty. The beets were not cooked. Think raw beet dipped in some kind of vinegar sweet juice.. The collards were terrible not even cooked. And I didnt bother tasting the Mac and cheese.  My husband said it was ok. But if your in this area of town looking for southern food I suggest skip this over rated place and head to midnight dinner or macs speed shop. Unless of course you just want beer and crowds. nnOn one other note the guys next to us asked for a couple shots the bartender lady said well this isnt really a bar bar, if you want that you need find just a bar.. Indicating she had no clue how to mix this shot they wanted which was just pickle juice and Irish whiskey.. Seriously not hard and all she had to do was google it which they did for her. nnIm not going to bother going back here. The service was sub par, the food was worse. Try it if you want to wait  hr or more at any time of day and want just say youve been to the new hip trendy place in town. Cheers."
0,"It was fair.  I went there with my girlfriend and some close friends last night.  We thought we would get in a meal after all the newness died down a bit.  We each ordered different burgers with the duck fat fries along with the roasted veg.  First, all the burgers were overdone.  I get the  degree oven concept but please try to perfect it on your time.  Not mine.  Outside of that, they were all, ok.  Nothing to write home about.  Unfortunately the bacon on one of my friends burger was ice cold literally.  The server who was great took it back right away and upon her return with many sincere apologies eluded to the fact that, thats how chef serves it, and that its very common in Europe.   Okay, I get it.  Thats fine, but we waited  minutes for the remade burger to return.   degree oven?  Shouldnt it take  minutes to remake a burger and warm up some bacon?  Also, chef?  Really?  Dude, you serve  burgers, a salad and a chicken sandwich. Anyway, duck fat fries were a little soggy.  They didnt knock anyones socks off.  The little mini doughnuts however, were out of this world.  Overall, not a great eating experience.  For such a small menu, they might want to perfect it.  Also, during our meal, right across from our table at the bar, sat what appeared to be a very drunk, regular.  At one point during our meal she removed her bra at the bar to impress the  guys she was talking too.  Im by no means a prude but it was inappropriate for a very public place.  Not that this is The Grinds fault by any means but the staff did see her do it and chose to look away instead of addressing her"
0,"We put in our name and waited  minutes, while groups of various sizes, who came in after uswere seated ahead of us. When I checked back with the hostess and pointed to an empty table near her she said, Im sorry. I cant seat you there. Its a fire hazaard. Then proceeded to seat another party there. We finally left. Wont be back."
0,This is the worst store in Las Vegas. They never have anything you need. If I could I would give them  stars I would. Their customer service is beyond poor and I am done ever shopping at this Vons. Someone from management needs to really pay attention and either care or someone needs to be reported.
0,"Went to Filibertos because I wanted fish tacos. Was very disappointed because the fish tasted as if it was sitting out for hours maybe even days, and recooked. I took one bite and that was it. When I approached the workers not only did they deny that the fish was bad, but they refused to give me an order of something else at no cost. Very disappointed and never going back!"
0,"We stopped by late morning one Saturday for a bloody mary, having read they have one  of the best in town.  The place was pretty busy  lots of people crowding tables for breakfast, but we were able to find a spot at the bar.  We ended up waiting about  minutes before we were noticed.  Strike one.nnThe bloody mary itself was the absolute worst Ive ever had.  I fully admit Im not a fan of horseradish, but I can handle it in moderation.  The Old Fashioned bloody, however, was just teeming with it.  That wouldnt have been the end of the world, except that the mix had only the slightest hint of tomoato flavor.  Overall, the drink tasted like water and horseradish.  Gross.nnI pushed the drink aside, as there was no way I was going to drink it.  The bartender came back about  minutes later.  She asked if we were done, and I said yes.  She then took the completely full drink away without saying a world.  Wouldnt you think to maybe ask if something was wrong with it?  Yeah, I would too.nnShe dropped off the check, we paid, left, and will never return.  Yes, I should have said something about how terrible the bloody mary was, but I also believe that any halfway experienced bartender would also know to ask when a patron is obviously not pleased with a drink.  Im sure this is a great place for breakfast, and Ive had good beer  reasonably good food her in the past.  But if its a bloody mary you want, please take my advice and go elsewhere.  Unless you really, really love horseradish  water."

0,"I cant really say anything about the food as Ive never eaten it.  This would be for the following reason.nnLet me begin by saying, I love local owned business. I would rather spend my money there than a chain any given chance I have. nn I work on Bell Road and get my breakfast every Saturday morning from the Dennys at the I and Bell on my way into work.  I noticed Fast Eddies a few months ago and thought to try them.  So as I was leaving for work I called in an order and a half hour later showed up to pick up my food.  Needless to say it wasnt ready.  Not only was it not ready nobody knew anything about my order.  Well I didnt factor in the huge difficulties of writing down an order into my morning commute so I didnt have time to wait.  I was amazed at how used to this kind of thing the entire staff seemed.  They all were kind of like ah well, shucks, maybe next time.... see ya.nnSoooo fast forward to today .  Im leaving my house for work and I think to myself They cant screw it up twice...I need to give em another shot  So I did.  WHOOPS!  It was just like last time.  It played out precisely the same.  However this time I factored in the error to be made and promptly went to Dennys and waited for my food.nnSo yeah, I cant say anything about their food, but I cant see where it would be worth the gamble of being pissed off due to such awful service.  And then further angered when they just dont care that youre not getting the service that comes with say.... a business."
0,"I was disappointed with my visit to Cafe on Main.nnMy husbands Belgian waffle was cooked to a crisp. It wasnt burnt, but it wasnt fluffy at all. I was hard and dry. It was supposed to be lemon poppyseed flavored, but I couldnt taste it.nnI ordered the eggs benedict special, but without the meat, and with the eggs cooked so that they practically hardboiled. My meal was delivered with meat on the sandwich, so I sent it back. When I finally did get my order, the eggs werent cooked as well as I like. While not runny, they were still pretty gellike. I know they probably rushed to get them out due to the mixup, which I appreciate to a point, but...nnThe hollandaise sauce wasnt impressive, either. It missed that tanginess that makes hollandaise sauce so irresistible. This was just bland yellow goo atop the egg.nnI did like the potato pancakes, but they were tiny. I left hungry and bored.nnThe server was pleasant and prompt with refills, and the dining area was cute, but those small positives arent enough to outweigh the fact that food was mostly boring andor bad."
0,If I could give a negative star review I would. We found bugs in our beds two different rooms and they refused to comp the stay. We are pretty sure it was bed bugs and even have pictures and the dead bugs to prove it. Do not stay here.
0,Just tried the Chinese food which was mediocre at best by my picky standards. Maybe the sushi would have been better. nnThis location was originally home to Yens for many years an exceptional neighborhood Chinese restaurant which closed about a year ago due to illness. My expectations were no doubt high and unfortunately not met. nnI used to make a  minute drive for Yens but dont expect to do the same for Mr Wok.nBut try it yourself if youre in the area and write a review to confirm or deny my experience.
0,This pool is beautiful. The sand and trees and overall layout are very attractive and enjoyable. nnMy experience with the staff here completely ruined my afternoon. We kept waiting for the waitress to come around and  minutes later I gave up and walked  minutes away to get an overprice quesadilla. The people at the pool restaurant were curt and unhelpful with my order. nnEveryone seemed to have a holier than thou attitude instead of going with the chill atmosphere of a beachy pool. nnThe signage here is also AWFUL. Looking for the bathroom? No signs for that. Searching for a snack? No signs for that either. Hoping to escape the snobby pool setting and head home? Nope no sign for the exit. nnTake a map and be prepared to be met with snobbery.
0,"Do not eat here!! The buffet line down the hall is a much better bet. nnThe two stars are for the appetizers. The clam chowder was decent, nothing special.  The burgers on the other hand were horrible. We ordered the regular cheese burger, chilli cheese burger, and the onion mushroom swiss burger. All were dry with absolutely no flavor.  out of  of us left behind more than half your burgers. You know its bad when you dont even want to take leftovers home. nncontributing to the bad food was the bad service. Our burgers took over  minutes to come out even though we ordered them to be cooked rare and medium rare. Seriously how long does it take to slap a basically raw piece of meat in between two buns and cheese."
0,"We got a sandwich about an hour ago and couldnt even eat it, it was horrible.  The bread tasted like it was a week old.  It literally broke apart, it was so stale.  I called and spoke to Dawn who could have cared less.  She never even said she was sorry.  She said the manager was not there and all she said when I told her how bad the bread was.... Oh !!!!  Very poor customer service."
0,"Least professional service on earth! Twice Ive called ahead for rides, and twice the driver showedup late. Tonight I witnessed someone, standing next to me, call and order with the same request cab w car seatonly I called ahead. Their cab came before mine.

0,"Ok, I did not go here by choice, but because my former company decided this would be a classy place for a Christmas party, I can at least maybe spare others!! The show was funny and entertaining, yes. And yes, I did get pulled up on stageI had to can can kick like a Vegas dancer. It was the food and the service that left the bad taste in my mouth. Now maybe a diner on Van Buren should not raise anyones expectations, Orrrrrr....maybe you could try that much harder because youre a diner on Van Buren!! They didnt. Food was about as good as what I remember of hospital food. The servers were wrong, confused, unprofessional and didnt seem to have the simple concept of service down, but again, show was kind of cool. Skip this place if you can! There are too many other places in the area to even waste on meal!"
0,Tried this place for the st time last timennFood was ok but service was NOT GREAT.nnthe manager on duty was more concerned about coaching an employee than attending to the customers in the store.  We ordered  burgers that took  minutes which no one else in the restaurant.nnI had to go up and get my order because they are all to busy to attend to usnnMoral of the story.  Great service can make up for OK food BUT poor service cant over come GREAT food
0,"Just finished one of the worst massages of my life here and Ive been getting massages    times per month for the past  years so that is saying a lot. I say massage cause it was really mostly just lotion rubbing.  Second time here today and Ive held off on a review till now. First was okay and just a bit below average, maybe .   out of  but I decided to give this place another chance since they are students after all.nnI know places like this are all luck of the drawhit or miss but you could get unlucky like me and waste your time and money. Today was way below average, maybe . out of  and the . stars are solely for their courtesy, cleanliness, and how polite they are. They really are friendly and professional so Ill give them that.nnI do feel bad for leaving a bad review considering how nice they are and how they really do seem to be trying but I cannot in good conscience let someone else who needs a massage waste their time and money like I did. If you want to pay  to listen to some relaxing music and have someone rub lotion on you for  minutes and not get a single knot out or relieve ANY tension, then this is the place for you!nnI understand this is a massage school but they should teach some technique before letting their students practice on paying clients.  minutes and not finding a single knot or soretight tendon or muscle is pretty damn difficult considering I sit in front of a computer  hours a day  days a week AND workout    days a week so my entire upper backshoulderneck are constantly sore and tight!nnIf you have ever had a professional massage and want a real, therapeutic massage...save your time and money and go elsewhere! Sad to say but youll even get a more effective massage  more experienced masseuse at those unlicensed hour foot massage spas that work on your back for    minutes!nnIve wasted over  here including tip and almost  hours of my time to give this place two chances. Learn from my mistakes instead of having to make your own! nnI really dont understand where all these good reviews came from unless the familyfriends of students and staff are on Yelp??"
0,"Great selection of vegan, vegetarian, raw milk, prepared foods, bakery, cheeses and aged beef. Very expensive, trader Joes and Market district come to mind as a cheaper alternative. Parking at this particular store is a nightmare."
0,"So Ive been living in Vegas for  months now and hadnt checked this place out so I figured it was a must. I dropped in on a Wednesday night.. Margaritas were good.. not too crazy expensive.. I was expecting more. We got the volcano nachos.. they were def good buuut way too much for two people. There wasnt really much going on inside. We had to wait like  minutes. There was a band that looked like they were getting ready but we left before they started. Overall, ok experience but wont be going again."
0,"Its true that Five Guys serves up a good burger and their fries have a nice flavor, but for me, it doesnt really stand out from the rest of the average fast food burger chains out there. Being in the mall and coined as a fast food spot, I have been disappointed with their service twice now. The first time, we waited over  minutes for our burgers and fries, but I thought it might just be a fluke. Sadly though, last night the same thing happened again. I was surprised that the wait was was so long for such simple food and also since this is a fast food place. The staff was also very rude when we asked about our food after waiting so long. The wait resulted in us being late for the movie. I wont be eager to visit  Guys again, unless I have a lot of time. Then again, if I have a lot of time, I wont choose a fast food spot and instead go to a sit down restaurant. I hope they fix their service and turnaround time."
0,"Disappointing experience. They messed up on our orders more than once. They took one of the steaks off the bill, which was nice of them, but the experience was underwhelming. With so many other options, I wont be returning."

If that is your thing, then you will like it. I have a hard time paying . for a meal that was below average and as soon as we were done, we were asked to leave because they needed the table and had over booked. WHAT?? Are you kidding me?nnThere are so many good restaurants in Vegas. Everyone in my group had a steak sides and appetizers. There was nothing that stood out. It was very loud, they have a DJ playing really good dance music if you are into that. If you ask the water they will give you a CD of the DJ. The only plus to this dinner.nnI would recommend going somewhere else. Totally not worth the wait or the price."

I should have walked out when I walked in this place to hear crickets chirping it was so dead.nnWhat a MISTAKE. The man kept laughing at me when I asked him for what I usually get, said he did not have liquid gel, no gel, he had never heard of such a thing, that I had to have powder, I was confused. He was ROUGH. Afterward my hands hurt for days. I asked for my nails to be thin, and TWICE for him to taper them toward my cuticle so they didnt look like s press on nails. Unfortunately they turned out that way anyway. THEN at the end he gets out the LIQUID GEL and puts on a top coat of it!! I said THAT is what I wanted in the first place! He says no, we do acrylic powder then gel. NO WE DONT! I specifically started getting gels because acrylic hurts my nails so bad. nnI left with awful looking nails, was WAY WAY over charged  dollars for acrylic?! and then had to squeeze in an appointment with my girl before I left to fix them later in the week. I pay  for gels at my other salon I dont know where in the world this guy got his price from, since they do not post the prices on the wall they can just charge whatever they feel like I guess.nnAnd the worst part!!?? I got a nail infection from here!! Two days after I went I got a yellow spot that turned black and painful! I have never in my LIFE had a nail infection...GROSS!!!  nnNow I see why your shop was empty while my usual place was slammed!!"

0,"This was by far the WORST stay at any hotel I have ever stayed at. The staff was rude, the customer service was a joke and the stay horrible. Upon arrival, we were refuse Valet parking because I have an oversized vehicle and it wouldnt fit in the garage and the valet didnt want to have to walk  extra feet to the oversized lot. Then in going to our room after waiting in a ridiculous line with only  people working the checkin desk, we noted an unbelievably strong smell of Marijuana in the hall where our room was located  a NONsmoking floor. When I mentioned it to security, they said they would send someone and it never happened. Then I complained tot he manager Phil who told be that because Nevada was a medical marijuana state, they had to be careful how they handled it but would address the matter. When I asked about it being a nonsmoking floor, he explained that smoking marijuana was not considered smoking and therefore was ok to do on a nonsmoking floor  are you kidding me? Smoke is smoke. when we returned yet again to marijuana strong in the hall, we handled it by making a scene in the hall about people searching for drugs for sale  it never happened again!!!!!! The motor cycle rally coming in was obnoxious and rude  making a point to rev their engines and blare to radios from  AM to  AM in the hotel drive. When calling the front desk at  AM to have them go address the matter, they states that they were coming in for a Rally and could do as they wanted  which was rude to EVERY PAYING GUEST TRYING TO SLEEP! Then on my last day there, the elevators went down. It took  minutes to catch an elevator and I had to go up before going down. It was SEVERAL hours until they would allow customers to use the service elevators and because of the issues took  hours to get bell service. I will NEVER stay with this joke of a hotel casino again for ANY reason!"

0,"Excellent service. I usually dont go to this different barber shops unless if I am in the rush. I was trying this location out after reading bunch of reviews, but sadly the excellent customer service isnt followed with quality work. I wanted to get a fade around my head, but the lady only cut it down to size  and she manage to put a small cut on my forehead when she was cutting my bangs.

0,"We went there on a Tuesday night in Jan. . The weather was nice of course so we decided to sit outside. There were maybe  people or so on the patio overlooking the strip. There were no seats looking out on the strip so we sat down at a table and waited. And waited. And waited. And waited. One waitress walked by and glared at us, giving me a look like what the fuck are you doing here and why are you making my life miserable? So we waited a few more minutes and left. nnWhat I observed while waiting was that the ritas are served in plastic cups, which tells me that they are not going to be good. And the food looked very mediocre. I doubt that Sammy would be happy. But then again, everything is so overpriced he probably is raking in the dough."
0,"Me and my husband had a late dinner for the first time a few days ago. The restaurant was pretty empty, except for a few tables on patio. First, it took  minutes for our waiter to acknowledge we were there, then it took another  minutes to get our drinks. We finally had to talk to hostess to see if we could get some service, our waiter finally arrived with our drinks...no apologies or acknowledgement that he was taking unusually long. nnWe finally ordered our food and it was not great. The steak we ordered was cold, i asked for rare, but it was cold and barely cooked. The mash potatoes were rubbery and gummy, like they had been sitting all day and over mixed. I didnt even finish my food. If you need to get a late night dinner, go somewhere else between the service and food, we wont ever be going back."
0,"I hate going into this store. It is very disorganized, cluttered, and impossible to get assistance. When you do get assistance they are usually very short and rude in their responses.

0,"AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!nHungry for a delicious breakfast I gave this place a try after my workout. How wrong was I when I decided to order the spinach omelette. The menu described it with heirloom tomatoes. When the server dropped my food I looked him in the eye and asked Is this the heirloom tomato? to which he lied to my face and saying yes. I work in a fine dining restaurant in Los Angeles and I know the difference among tomatoes. When I went to the register to pay for my meal the chef who was on the poster for the restaurant was there. The cashier asked me Was everything ok? to which I replied not really! and she followed what was wrong? I explained about what happened and the chef heard and approached me without apologizing saying  But thats the tomato we have. Well, this is not customer service nor any kind of recovery at all. But how about at least telling your servers here are the changes on the menu TODAY! Btw the food was blend and boring."

0,"Why do people go here? I found the food to be Icanteatthis gross quality, and Im no Mexican food snob. They cover almost everything in different sauces that taste like organic matter mixed with leftover Campbells soup. The meat was dry. Fried things were soggy, and the only thing that tasted like something edible was my taco which was, of course, cold.nnTo top it off, our waitress was really...unusual. First, she bordered on flatout rude as we tried to pick out a beer. By the end of the meal, she wanted to talk  she spontaneously shared that she likes to eat a big combination platter after puking following a night out drinking. Not something you want to head after trying to choke down some of that same combo platter. Then she told us how she ate a  pound burrito on a bet.nnBizarre.nnBut, obviously, I am wrong. Because people seem to love this place and they vote it the best and they clean their enormous plates. I feel icky right now and am never going back."

0,I honestly dont know why I continue to come to this location. The food here just isnt good. The first time I came here the guy serving my food had a cold and had a running nose and it was messy. I thought I would give it another try but the food just doesnt taste good. Not pleased
0,"Dont waste your time!!!! This restaurant is terrible. They describe themselves to you by saying they have smaller portions like its a good thing to charge  for less food, but smaller is an understatement. They served a Salami platter with exactly one  slice of salami on it, seriously, a teaspoon of balsamic vinegar,  crackers,  slices of cheese that tastes like feet, one tblsp of jam and one of thick ranch dressing that they call mousse. All of this for the low, low price of . Their desserts are tiny, and the chocolate peanut butter one had a description that would make any Reeses lover want it consisted of three tiny little brown crackers that tasted more like cardboard than the chocolate it was supposed to be, with several tiny dollops of some light brown paste that tasted a little like cream cheese with a dash of peanut butter thrown in. There was a chocolate cage on top which tasted good, but that wasnt worth the  I paid. To top it all off, the waitress was terrible and snarky.nnIf you want good, authentic Italian food with similar prices but decent portions, try Tutti Santi. It has a great wine selection and bar, and the food is sensational."
0,"I would not be so generous and give a  Star, because of the bait and switch. We got to the bar, at pm, lured into visiting because beer that night was . a glass  even I would come out for that, so we got there and the girl at the entrance said that the . per glass of beer wouldnt start till after  pm, so we split, and said wed be back. We returned at  pm, and the same girl told us beer was not a nickel but admission was  per person. WHAT THE F !!! If we had stayed beer was about  a bottle. I could handle the seediness of the place, and they seemed to wish to provide some musical entertainment, all nice, but how about honoring invitations like the one that duped us into visiting?"
0,"I just endured the worst Del Taco experience of my life.nnMy family pulled into the Drive Thru just to order a kids meal.  We ordered a hamburger with ketchup and lettuce, fries and a chocolate shake.  I had to repeat my order  times because the complexity of a burger with just ketchup and lettuce on it was just too much.  nnI pulled up directly to the window because there was no one else in the drive thru.  I sat for  seconds according to the electronic timer before I was greeted with our shake machine is broken, can you pull you the back? I said can I at least have my food?.  She went back and looked and apparently it wasnt ready which she informed me of.nnI pulled around back and waited  minutes and nothing.  So I went inside.  I could see my shake sitting on the counter, whip cream melting,  there was no one at the counter and  girls were working in the back.  One of them asked can I help you?  My response was I am still waiting on my kids meal. She said oh confused.  Asked all the girls where is the kids meal?  They all had a dumbfounded look.  After a few minutes she handed me a kids meal.  The receipt inside was to a red burrito.  I checked the burger and all it had on it was cheese.  I told her it was wrong.  After she explained it to the cook several times, I finally received my burger correctly.  nnI then noticed my shake was not stirred and you could still see the chocolate  syrup separate from the ice cream.  I decided to stir it myself.  At the end of the  minute ordeal, my kid got her food and she said it was good.nnI was never offered an Im sorry or any sort of apology.  Just looks of irritation like they did not expect to have customers who actually wanted food.  Also when I  was standing at the counter a female patron had to return her tacos because they were incorrect.  nnThis is the worst Del Taco and the worst set of employees I have ever seen.  I will never be back."
0,If you like TV dinner mexican food then On the Border might be for you. However if you like legit Mexican food dodge this place and head over to somewhere like El Charro in West Mesa or even Mattas for that matter. OTB is awful and Im not surprised this particular location closed.
0,"Its an ASU rite of passage to eat here. Most of the times I ate at Guss it was staggering over from one of the bars in the joint parking lot after a binger.  Man was that the best pizza I ever ate at am, burned the roof of my month and everything! A giant greasy slice of pepperoni pizza with some crushed red pepper sprinkled on the top, PERFECTION!nnI tried them sober, and thats another story, but I still like to stop in and grab a slice for old times sake."
0,"Wow, If only no stars was possible. They are by far the worst cab company ever. Terrible service and always something new.The dispatcher is really rude, also the cab drivers are always  confused as to where they are going. Not structured, not clean, and not welcoming."
0,"I made a reservation and was told only bar seats were still available. Yet when I got to the restaurant a lot of tables were open. Sitting at the bar was uncomfortable. The waiters and barstaff are working, splashing water and ice around sometimes it lands on you. Sometimes they forget and let out a swear and it just makes for a feeling like youre seated in the back of a kitchen. Highly unpleasant seating, would not recommend accepting anything less than a table out front. As the evening heats up waitstaff are constantly bumping you as they pass by, no matter how much you scooch in. nnThis place could have redeemed itself on the basis of good food. Alas. They are of the unfortunate school of restaurants who think more food  better. NO. More of mediocre food is just a lot of mediocre food. The PDC cut, for example, was raw in the middle and hard to saw through. You would think something named PDC cut would fall off the bone and be cooked all the way through. Alas. nnThe blood sausage tort was more of an enormous pizza with blood sausage chunks on top. It was very delicious, but the presentation was lacking, the portion much too enormous. The PDC house beer was a limpwristed sparkling water rather than a beer. nnI dont know, I wouldnt waste your time and money on this place when there are so many others to choose from. I was very disappointed with this restaurant."
0,"Food and alcohol deserve  stars  very standard classic spanishbasque tapas executed well, very creative and delicious specialty cocktails.nnAmbiance and service deserve  stars  overly loud dining room, unnecessarily lazy staff and servers.nnFor the details  nnFirstly, Jaleo messed up my reservation.  I originally had a res for a party of  people  PM on Friday.  I called  days prior to change to  people   PM.  I didnt get a confirmation call the dayof which I thought was weird.  Sure enough, they never changed the original reservation and since we were an hour late when we arrived, they had already given up our table.  They did seat us immediately but had to squeeze us into a table meant for  right at the front of the restaurant by the bar and hotel escalators.  Yuck.  And, as noted by many here, the main dining room is certainly loud.nnI also think its ridiculous that they dont answer their phones before dining service begins.  Having to wait til PM on the east coast to call and make and then change reservations was ludicrous.  This is probably also why they dont call you to confirm.nnSo, we were seated and the waitress came around to take drink orders and informed us that, in her exact words, the kitchen is broken and they were doing all the cooking on the grills in the middle of the restaurant, so there were a few dishes that werent available.  She didnt specifically mention which, of course.nnWe got our drinks and they were all amazing.  The famous GT, sangria, some gold sparkly drink, a drink with instructions on how to drink it dip this into this, then put this in your mouth, then sip this, then do a dance...nnNow, Im a tapas whore, and the menu at Jaleo is very much standard classic tapas, nothing really out of the ordinary.  So I go to order  of the usual suspects for my wife and I.  They couldnt make a single one of them.  Well, what can you make then?  Well nothing from this side of the menu or that side of the menu.  So...let me try again...what CAN you make?nnWound up figuring things out and placing our order, and the tapas started arriving shortly thereafter.  Except the runners kept coming to my side of the long table, saying to me what the dish was, and then putting it down in front of me.  So I had to turn into the waiter, loudly screaming across the table to see who ordered each dish and then passing it down.  I finally got fed up around the th plate or so and started forcing the runners to do their job and figure out who ordered each dish so they could place it in front of the right person.  For.every.single.dish.  Ugh.nnAlso, there were a few dishes we had ordered doubles of that we never received.  nnThank god the food was good.  We probably ordered every dish that was available and none disappointed.  Winner of the night in my book was the lamb ribs.  Falloffthebone delicious.  Other mentionables  patatas bravas were potato chips which was a neat twist, and the romesco sauce had an interesting smokey flavor.  Otherwise, as I said, pretty standard stuff all executed well."
0,"I came here for lunch midweek and just wasnt excited with any of it.  The place was busy, but even taking that into consideration service was not very good.  Since we had waited a while to be seated, we tried to give the server our appetizer order right away, but she didnt want that.  Then, only when she came back later to take our order did she tell me the item I had ordered was out.  That felt a little like a waste of time, because now I need to read the menu again.nSince we were seated by the open kitchen, I saw our lunches come up, but our server was sitting down with the table next to us while our food waited under a heat lamp.  That probably didnt make much difference though as it was extremely unexceptional.  I tried half of the chicken club and half of the burger.  The bottom bun on the burger fell apart after a few bites  big burger sin!nThe chicken club was dry and both sandwiches had components listed on the menu  balsamic onions and roasted tomato mayo, that sounded great, but were lost in the final result."
0,"I have been previously going to Diva Beauty on eastern and my goto lady was the one whose station was in the middle towards the back. Her work was clean and she really listened. I ALWAYS left happy. nnNow, after reading such great review about this place I decided to give it a shot. I walked in and there was no one at the front desk. I signed in shortly after had a women escort me to one of the chairs. nnFor such high expectation, I am highly disappointed and super angry. I already had a shape and she asked what I wanted. I told her that I had I wanted to maintain my existing shape.nnAfter they were done, they looked HIDEOUS. I am horrified, I take care of my skin with SPF, night creams, day creams, undereye creams, laser, juvederm all for the sake of looking my best.nnIm not sure about anyone else, but when I go to get my eyebrows done professionally, I expect it to have nice shapearchetc in proportion to YOUR face.nThe eyebrows I got were thin with no shape.  I look like a Chola who took a pencil to her brows I am seriously mortified. And for the next month , everytime I look in the mirrorwaiting for my eyebrows to grow backI will think about that Indian women who made me look like a drag queen.nIf I wanted poorly shaped eyebrows, I would have saved myself some money, taken a tweezer to my brows, and gone GUNHO.nnAfter I reexamined in the car, I walked back because my arch on the TOP was not even. What did she do instead? She fixed the top AND the bottom. nnI came here because of the great reviews and cheap prices. You definitely get what you pay for.nI will gladly attach a picture of my results."
0,"We thought the food was good, we both tried the Specialty of the house the in. Italian Beef sandwich wet style as suggested. They were much bigger than expected and filled much more than expected and the hot pepper mix was tasty this sandwich can feed two people. This sandwich is very sloppy to eat and thats OK but you will have to use the restroom to clean yourself up after you eat it.nnThis one star rating is because we WILL NEVER COME BACK after visiting the restrooms.nnThe womens restroom has deep embedded dirt in the floor with heaping piles of dust that you can see around the edges. I have NEVER SEEN such a dirty floor.nnThe mens restroom was out of soap.nnThis is NOT ACCEPTABLE"
0,"Well, it does get one from point A to point B in Pittsburgh.nnBut its expensive, at least compared to the Metro Transit in Minneapolis that Im used to. On Port Authority, its . for a ticket, and an extra  for a transfer which only gets you on one more bus, not all the way to your destination if it requires a bunch of transfers. Coming from a maximum of  for two and a half hours of bus rides express bus during rush hour, Port Authority is steep. I had to grab cash a couple of different times just to make sure I could keep paying fares throughout the days.nnTheres no day pass. Boo. If youre traveling a lot throughout the day, it adds up fast without some sort of pass.nnAlso, the X doesnt pick up passengers coming from downtown into Oakland or drop them off in the reverse direction. Very frustrating, especially with a Megabus terminal only three blocks away from one of the stops. Theres also Greyhound and Amtrak downtown, if I remember correctly."
0,My husband and I usually LOVE senor frogs whenever we go on vacation so we decided to come here for his birthday.  WAY overpriced.  It was  for  people.  The yard glasses have a game in the bottom so they dont have to fill up.  The place is way too loud even for senor frogs.  The waitstaff were not engaging.  Id suggest going to Kahunaville downstairs instead.
0,small and under staffednnot worth the wait in line... panini was average.ngood price ... for panininnot enough space inside so you will wait outside and be pushed at the door when you finally get there by the people leaving.
0,"My friends and I make a yearly trip to Vegas I was very disappointed with the Monte Carlo! On the upside The girls at the front desk are friendly and professional, the view was nice, The location could not be better, the restaurants and bars inside were all Amazing Id recommend Minus  ...very COOL experience... and Diablos Cantina ... the food was very tasty The food court is also very convenient and offers a decent variety. On the down side the moment you walk in you smell this over powering scent that is similar to that powder women in there s and up wear and cigarettes yuck, definitely not something you want to smell if youre coming back from a night of drinking the room was to small for two beds, there was no frig or coffee maker, the walls are thin and you can hear everything everyone is doing on both sides, there was not enough counter space or maybe thats because there were  people in our room oops lol, the wiifi was the worst it kept disconnecting, the hotel is very out dated and could use MAJOR and I mean MAAAAAJOR updating everything thing seemed old except for the flat screen TV, I tried to take a bath and the water kept draining by its self the plug didnt help the water would not stay at a level that covered my body and Im not big In fact Im very small it shouldnt have been an issue, the toilette seat was not sturdy and made this loud noise every time we flushed which scared me almost every time, room servicehousekeeping took forever and were not friendly, and the hotel is trying to preserve water so they dont change the sheets unless you ask them to what kinda  is that? Im all for going green but I just expected more. We stayed at the Luxor in a high price room  for cheaper than what we payed for the Monte Carlo ...again disappointed... also most of the guest and crowd are older not exactly the place to be for the partying all night. nnTo wrap it up I would go to the bars and restaurants inside the Monte Carlo but I would not stay there again. hope this was helpful first review"
0,"I was a return customer at this location for a while. However a recent experience has changed that. I received a coupon for a free small cheese pizza with a purchase of  or more for my birthday. I called in my order and the first girl I spoke to clearly had no idea what she was doing because she handed off the phone to someone else without telling me to hold or even saying anything. The second girl I spoke to was talking to me like I was an idiot then proceeded to tell me that I was not a rewards member even though I have signed up, the coupon was emailed to me and had my name printed on it, she had never heard of the promotion and kept asking more questions. So I simply asked if I could use the coupon or not hoping to get a direct answer and end this call. That is not what I got. She put in my order for two calzones and not the pizza until I came in to actually show her the coupon. When I got there she told me the coupon was for another location and they didnt do that. She did offer me a free birthday cannoli because apparently that is what this location does so the extra star is for that. Aside from that she couldve handled the situation much better and saved some aggravation. Instead she wasted my time by making come down there knowing that they dont take that coupon and now I was stuck paying  for two calzones that I wouldnt have bothered ordering if I knew it wouldnt be honored. My main issue is with the company itself for sending me a coupon to a location that I have never been to before, never signed up at and is at the opposite end of town from me. Coupons for the company should be accepted at all locations and if they are not then that should be CLEARLY STATED on the coupon, which it was not. Im big on customer service and needless to say after this, I will not be returning to this or any other Rosatis location."
0,"This area has needed another hot dog joint since the demise of that other HD place City Hot Dogs located where PioPio is now located. City Hot Dogs had a great doityourself topping bar and I kinda wish JJs took note of that and expanded what they offer.nnWalking in impressed by the decor and merchandising, I really expected to be wowed. I saw some beautiful looking franks  sausages coming from the grill area to the counter where a small army of employees added the various toppings and sent them on their way.nnI placed my order for something easy and tasty that cant be screwed up a chilicheese coney with onion rings and a sweet tea. Next to the fountain station was a tiny topping bar and I got a small cup of the vinegarveggies and they were quite good. Probably the most flavorful item the place had on this visit. Doesnt sound good saying that, does it?nnSweet tea was average. Chilicheese coney, while a decent size, lacked any memorable flavor. I figured with the frank being charred the way it was, that dog was going to pop with flavor. No dice. Chili was kinda bland. I had to douse this sucker with some hot sauce and a dash of salt  pepper. The onion rings were a failure. I think the majority of the breading was left in the little basket or on my lap. Somebody aint frying these suckers right and ketchup is a must to dip them in. Not a lot of flavor to be had out of these either.nnFor the price I paid, I felt like this place did not deliver. I can easily go to Greens around the corner from my building and get  hot dogs for the price of JJs one and even though Greens is guilty of using canned chili, frozen fries  onion rings, etc.....the tastes and bargain there are so much better. I can get a dash of more flavor out of a bottle of Texas Pete there than anything JJs had to offer.nnMethinks JJs needs to strive harder in coming up with food that will match what theyre trying to accomplish. Merchandising already? Really? Cmon! Work on your product first! Its like theyre trying to sell this off as a franchise before theyre putting their money where their mouth is in the actual menu itself. I even saw a group of the ownersmanagerspartners having a powwow in a booth, hatching up their next scheme. Do you know hard it was for me not to go over there and rain on their parade?nnI would like to make a return visit and at least try one of their brats or other sausages.  For selling me an overpriced hot dog, I say this place fails. For such a lack of flavor they should at least given me  for that price. At least expand that toppingbar so I can boost the flavor up some how.nnAs I told Sam J., hot dogs should never cross into that gourmet territory that hamburgers have done in recent years unless theyre made with lobster gibblets and lips instead of the normal pig innards.nnYour pal,nWalter"

He mostly covered it. A couple of things he missed though. First, the room smelled faintly of dead hooker upon arrival. Thankfully, there was no dead hooker in the bathtub ... this time. But there was a pigeon outside the cracked bathroom window. nnSecondly, they had a CRT television. Really? Really? HDTVs are so cheap these days ... there is no excuse for ANY hotel having a CRT set. I didnt think those things even worked anymore. And I didnt turn it on to find out. nnStill, I gave it starts to his one because while Jay was up all night due to the paper thin walls, I took a triple dose of melatonin to escape the misery of this wretched room and PTFOd. Although I did hear the cat once ... I guess we know what happened to that pigeonnnAnd there were some bright spots. Outside of the carpet stains and obligatory pinhole burns in the comforter, the room was pretty clean. Either I missed the poop on the bathroom wall, or just figured Jay was leaving his mark The bed was fine. And the front desk service was polite.

0,"The waitress forget to order our food to the kitchen,  waited for  for the first out of six plates. Returned the chicken sweet and sour,  too hard and couldnt see the chicken but flours, no bowl,  missing napkins and on and on.

Only  of the  plates were decent. Will go to Chinatown instead for the future."
0,"The manager gave me attitude just for ordering a water with lemon and didnt acknowledge when i said thank you for serving me my drink.

0,"Unfortunately I hate to write a negative review but I have too. Ive been in this business before and absolutely loved the service that my husband and I received. Extremely courteous and friendly. My husband had called because I told him that my engagement ring which is NOT a Gauthier ring the center diamond was feeling loose. He called and told them the situation, and the lady said to come in and they would tighten it even though it wasnt their ring. So we live in North Scottsdale and made the trip down there. I walked in and the young salesperson shooed me away so I waited for another salesperson. He was extremely nice at first. I told him that my ring was loose and when I handed my ring to him. He looked disgusted and said this is not a Gauthier ring. We can not fix it. I told him that my husband called and was told to come in. That the salesperson knew it was not a Gauthier ring. He very pointedly said he would not fix it and ushered me out. He made me feel terrible. We wouldnt have wasted our time to drive there only to be turned away. We were customers. But now we are not. Which makes me sad. I enjoyed their jewelry very much. Simple business , a simple positive experience will create a lasting relationship for future purchases, BIG FAIL!"

The soup took half an hour to receive after ordering and was disappointing. I ordered  on the spice level and the taste was flat and the temperature was lukewarm. In addition, the menu stated it contained flat noodles which wasnt served and the portion was small. For the price they charge, the soup wasnt worth .nnI would avoid Lotus of Siam for lunch in the future, its just too busy and not worth the hassle."
0,"Service was fine, ambiance is nice and the lunch special pricing is good.  So why the ?nnWell.. I really like spicy food, but spice with FLAVOR.... not the kind of spice that just rips your tongue off and leaves you with no taste buds whatsoever.  And unfortunately when I ordered the Panang Curry at what I thought was a pretty conservative spice level of  out of  yes, they only give you a  range... lame, they gave me the kind of spice I HATE.   I couldnt even enjoy it.  About halfway through I had lost any sense of taste and I had tears coming out of my eyes.  For a level ?!nnAnd the strange thing is, my brother ordered his dish I believe it was the Pad See Ew at a spice level  and his wasnt nearly as hot as mine.  So that leads me to believe they dont really know what theyre doing in the kitchen, and by reading some of the other reviews I dont think this was an isolated incident.nnSo that was a bummer.  Maybe if I gave them a second chance Id have a better experience, but I dont see myself rushing back any time soon."

0,"This was seriously sooooo disappointing.  I was responsible for picking this restaurant in the new, gorgeous casinohotel Aria and I did so based upon Yelp reviews.  You people let me down!!!  nnNot only was the food pretty terrible but the service was horrendous.  I booked a reservation which we clearly didnt need since ths of the restaurant was empty...not a good sign! at pm to make it to a pm for the Cirque de Soliel show at Bellagio, O.  Needless to say, we had to run there after the final touch of the bad experience  the waiter disappeared for about  minutes.  nnWe ordered the shellfish appetizer and both my friend and I specified we wanted it cold.  It arrived hot.  And when we sent it back, the waiter came and told us we ordered it hot.  Um, cardinal rule of serving is that you dont tell your customers they are wrong.  Im very new to shellfish and Ive only had it cold so there was no memory confusion here, folks.  nnSo pretty much that set the tone for the whole meal.  They have a fantastic cocktail menu that he never offered us until I asked...although the cocktails we ordered were far from the best.  nnThe entrees were disgusting.  I ordered the Salmon with some sort of soup they poured over it which had a predominate taste of salt.  The salmon was very rarealmost sushi.  Bleech.  I cant remember, unfortunately what my friend had but she gave me an ick face too.  nnI should have stopped eating but the portions were so small I wanted dessert...so I ordered chestnut ice cream.  How can you go wrong with ice cream?  Well, it tasted like chalk.  nnIt ended up being about  each...wayyyyy too much for that crappy customer service and that lackluster of food.  There are so many great restaurants in this town...dont let what must be the friends and family of the owners convince you with just a handful of reviews to eat at this place.  nnIts been two weeks and I still have a bad taste in my mouth!!!"
0,"Weve gotten their food a few times now and its not bad. My review is based more on the fact that its basically just American Chinese  Cantonese style Americanised Chinese food. I expected something better from such a big restaurant with an enticing name. this is nothing more that overpriced takeout. nI do like that the people who own it are actually Chinese instead of a bunch of Mexicans making Chinese food. nIf you like run of the mill Americanstyle Asian food then this is a great place, the food IS good. If you want real Chinese food, go to California because the only place in Arizona closed last year until I find another hidden somewhere."

0,Their car museum is a ripoff.  I cant believe they charge admission. They only have  motorcycles and  cars. No info is displayed.

Its also dark and deserted in there very depressing. Sure wish I could get my money back.

When I got back to my table, I tried to stick my fork in a carrot and the carrot flew of the table because it was so hard. The stir fry was RAW and gross. My next visit I decided to eat off the menu. I ordered the . cheeseburger. The waiter asked me how I wanted it cooked I said medium. When I got the burger, it was really small and way overdone! I think this academy is simply pushing students through without real training so they can simply get out in the workforce. Im giving them  stars because the waitstaff was courteous.

0,"Dear Bachi HLK,nnCongrats on joining the healthy raw foods, eat kale and quinoa til you drop fad ala True Food Kitchen or Tender Greens. The place looks great with modern finishes, bamboo and a clean look and feel however I have a huge newsflash for you. YOU ARE LOCATED IN A STRIP MALL IN LAS VEGAS and not even the better parts of Vegas like your burger joint. Charging  for a oversaltened Salmon on a  oz beet salad for lunch is ACANINE! The salad was pretty good but the salmon? Marginal with blackening that was wayyy too strong. Oh and did I mention the  juice which is OK if it wasnt the size of a kids cup. You are overpriced for your location and demographic. I can justify paying  for a Kale and Salmon salad on the beach in Santa Monica or Newport Beach at True Food Kitchen or in downtown Walnut Creek at Tender Greens but certainly not in a strip mall on the corner of Rainbow and Russell at lunchtime! nnThere is definitely demand for what youre offering if the food is good not convinced yet but not at the prices youre proposing. Unfortunately I dont see you sticking around too long. Great build out though for the next restaurant that will end up at that location. I am sure they will greatly appreciate what youve done!"
0,"The sad thing is that every Japanese resident of Clark County would rather shop at Greenland Market than Nakata or Japan Creek.  Whenever I am at Greenland, I find every single Japanese person I know hanging out at the Japanese food aisle. I constantly run into the cooks from Monta, the angry old man from Ichiza, a ton of various Sushi Chefs, and even the workers from INaba. Do these authentic Japanese restaurants actually get their ingredients from a Korean Market?nnThe produce here is awful and totally fcking costs too much. nnThe only nice workers are the Latino ones, no one else ever even gives me eye contact. nnK JUN chicken in the food court was good while it lasted but apparently they fcking kicked them out. Fck You Mr. Greenland or whoever the fck owns this place!nnChappagetti is the best jajangmeon we got here in LV but I feel its slightly missing something on account of the fact that its not Chinese owned. Jajangmeon is NOT Korean. It shocks me how many Koreans think it is an authentic Korean dish. Jajangmeon is a Chinese dish which became very popular in Korea. nnAnyone who knows me knows that I always bitch to my Japanese friends most particularly Aaron K about how Koreans tend to treat me like sh!t. I dont appreciate it at all. My Mom is Korean, so that makes me Korean, and during my youth I constantly attempted to reach out to the Korean community but was always pushed away by snotty FOB Koreans, who hated every single damn thing about me. My Dad is a rd generation Japanese American, and no one in my family speaks any other language but English..but is that a just reason to consider me an outsider in the Korean community?  My brother took more of the Korean side of the gene pool and grew up to be . Many of you idiots dont know this but the average height in South Korea is actually around , which is considerably taller than South American and African countries. Koreans tend to be one of the taller ethnic groups in the world. Well, the workers at Greenland assume my brother is Korean on account of his massive height and they treat him pretty darn good, but I cant get any sympathy over here. I hate how at Japanese Markets they think Im Korean, and at Korean Markets they think Im Japanese, and at Chinese Markets they think Im weird.nnOKAY.... the best thing here at Greenland is the FROZEN SMILING RABBIT MOON CREME BREAD. Believe me, you have to fcking try it. Pictured here  httpwww.yelp.combizphotosqVOlQKVQEWJLePw?fsidIOtlWWFEOARLbSyGwVbTKmBKPndNEUkbYAnnThey also sell those mega sized Mexican cokes for  the price you would get them at World of Coke for. World of Coke is officially useless now, and sucks!nnIve experienced this epidemic of White dudes married to Asian women trying to shield their wives when I walk by them.  They literally grab their wives and hold them really tight when they make eye contact with me. What the fck is this? What the hell is going on here? I know Im really fcking hot, and Im a giant womanizer, but Im not gonna steal your damn mail order bride. Stop being so paranoid! I have white uncles and most my white friends are married to Asian women.Its funny cause in Hawaii, its just a casual normal thing for Whites and Asians to marry..but for some reason the people here in LV think they are living some John LennonYoko Ono fantasy and that their relationship is forbidden or some stupid sh!t. Go shop at Albertsons or Smiths then if you dont feel comfortable shopping around Asian people. nnWhenever I come to this Koreatown shopping center, I usually just walk straight over to SUSHI ON RAINBOW, while my brother eats at Chappagetti. I dont know how we turned out so different. nnThe Moral of the Story is to eat FROZEN SMILING RABBIT MOON CREAM BREAD with Mexican coke.nnUPDATE Today I was at Greenland Market and the workers were talking about how confused they were that  everyone was now suddenly buying Frozen Smiling Rabbit Moon Cream Bread. Apparently, they had a hard time selling it in the past."
0,I was disappointed with the fish  chips last night. Weve had it many times before and its always been a goto menu item for me. But last night the piece of fish was half its usual size and they must have changed their fries. They were small schnibbles of fries  were on the greasy size. Ill go back but Ill try a different menu next time.
0,"I really, really, and pause........., really did not like my dinner.  The complimentary fries while were a nice touch, but I am picky about my seasoning and didnt like any of the three flavors truffle, garlic, oak seasoning.  I know, I know, thats on meI am the minority on the truffle and garlic thing.  But its who I am, lets work through it.  I hated the salad dressing and they put relish on my burger after requesting it be left off.   A complete honest mistake I know, but when a hamburger is  it needs to come out perfect.  They took it off without issue, but dinner was not satisfying.  I was sad."
0,Absolutely HORRIBLE service!!!!  Over an hour and a half for delivery and they still never showed up. No management and nobody gives a shit. They should be embarrassed to even be in business. Avoid this place like the plague. Id give them a negative  stars if I could. This place is horrible!!!!!
0,"I was excited to try Kiku due to the Yelp reviews when we stopped in Pittsburgh for a night en route to New York. Being a half Japanese woman living in Kentucky, I jump at the opportunity to get traditional Japanese at any chance I can get since my hometown is littered with sushi bars that specialize more in mayonnaise, fried, or spicy sauce laden fusion sushi rather than real Japanese food.  Kiku was definitely run by Japanese folk and the menu had the usual traditional fare. The food was pretty okay. We had the Agedashi Dofu which the broth was so mild its taste didnt transfer well to the tofu. They garnished with green onion and daikon oroshi grated radish but didnt have the customary bonito flakes. They also charged a whopping  for probably a  ounce portion. Id pay overblown prices for a good Agedashi Tofu, but this wasnt one. The Agedashi experience kind of defines the rest of our meal. Everything tasted okay but the prices were beyond ridiculous. We then realized we were in a touristy part of town and missed out on a lot of the amazing farm to folk fare in other areas. This place is meant to pull in hotel guests who arent really looking for real culinary fare and are unaware they are getting raped by prices.  The tuna in our tuna roll was on its way out, the smelt we ordered were just grilled with no sprinkle of sea salt or any kind of sauceand again, a whopping  for three small fish. All sushi was ordered by the piece and about  more expensive they any other sushi bar Ive been to outside of the Pacific Northwest, Tokyo, and NYC.  Example  for two pieces of salmon. The advertised mixed green salad was cut with iceberg lettuce. The chawanmushi was bland and a small tea cup size. If you are charging  for chawanmushi, use real crab. At least snow crab. And throw in a ginko nut.  On the good side, the dressing was yummy, the salmon sushi was really fresh, and the service was decent. nnOverall, food is not awful but not exciting and the prices are beyond ridiculous for what you get."
0,"A friend and I visited Pat Thai after I received a call from a man who said that if we mentioned his name wed get two meals for the price of one.  He got my name from the owners of the previous restaurant Sumantha, apparently, though I dont remember providing the number.nnAnyway, I figured Id offer the free meal to my friend, so off we went.  First of all, the place is TEENY like a large living room. When you walk in you are smack amongst the diners.  We were seated at a table that was so close to another occupied table that we decided to sit together on the same side to avoid interrupting the other diners.nnWe mentioned the mans name and the waitress nodded, saying that we would get a free appetizer. We said no, we would get a free MEAL, right?  She smiled and got some information and then agreed that we would get the second meal free.  nnWith that, we looked through the menu to decide on what we wanted. I decided upon mussaman, which is my favorite Thai dish well, nd favorite dish. Tom kha gai is my favorite. My friend had yellow curry with seafood.  We shared a stuffed chicken appetizer which we named Chickchicken, as it was a chicken stuffed with chicken. In style, it looked like a giant fried drumstick with a rouladelooking interior. Unfortunately, Chickchicken was DRY and simply not very good. It gave the impression of having been assembled and frozen at a Chickchicken factory it may be available at Costco.  Disappointing beginning. nnThen the entrees arrived.  My mussaman with fried tofu was flavorful, but after a few bites the overwhelming saltiness was too much for me.  It also had a very peanutty flavor that I thought was overdone.  In counterpoint, however, the potato chunks were UNDERdone.  I ended up eating a few bites and then calling it quits.  My friends curry dish, which she ordered with a heat factor scale of , was strangely bland.  No depth of flavor, whatsoever.  Not horrible tasting, just not a lot of taste to it.  She didnt finish her meal either, but we decided to take the meals home, as they werent complete disastersnnThe friendly woman hostess? Owner? She didnt identify herself who eventually removed our plates and boxed our leftovers never asked if wed enjoyed the meal, nor did she question the fact that we hadnt eaten all of the appetizer.  However, she made sure to mention at least eight times the fact that she wants us to return.  Then the bill arrived and of course we were not given a free meal the waitress wanted to give us the appetizer free instead.  A little friendly reminder over the deal wed been given over the phone eventually rectified the situation, but we were already disappointed with our experience, and this didnt help. nnAnyway, the hostess then wrote out two coupons for  of apiece as part of her campaign to get customers to return, and gave us each a brochure for the restaurant.  Then she talked about how important it is to get people to come back, told us she hopes well return, asked us to come back, told us she hopes shell see us again... you get the picture. I was starting to feel uncomfortable.nnI hate to say anything bad about people the staff were nice and Im sure everyone working there is caring and hardworking, but I just want decent food and good service when I visit a restaurant. If employees see that the food is not being eaten but they want you to come back, they should ask what went wrong and at least give the impression that they care about your experience.  We arent planning on going back.nnI asked my friend how shed rate the place, and she said .  I would give it a , which would round up to ., but since there is no . I dare not bump it up and make it look like I liked it more than I did.  Despite my negative experience, though, I dont hate this place, and Im willing to believe that some of their other menu items may be better than what we tried. Being a new establishment  struggling during a recession, they could be off their game right now. I wish them luck and really wished Id enjoyed the food."
0,"Want to stay in Vegas...but you arent so poor to sleep in a run down motel...and you dont have enough money for a good casino...welcome to the Strat!  This place is disgusting.  It is dirty, smells bad, filled with real lowlifes, and every place to eat is horrible.  I am giving one star for the rides at the top...but when you go...stand at the front door...grab your nose...AND RUN!!  Run right for the elevator to the top.  Something about the higher elevation that makes the horrible smell not so bad."
0,"After hearing from some friends for months that we must try Roosters, we had dinner there with my parents.   We had  reservations and the water glasses were filled promptly as we were seated.  THAT is where the prompt and good service ended.   nnIt took over  minutes for the waitperson to come to our table and bring us menus.  She asked if we would like drinks and we gave her our order.  THey didnt have the burbon my father requested and she forgot whether I wanted salt on my margarita.nnShe brought us our drinks and then she decided to read from the specials menu what the specials of the day were.  Guess we could have read them ourselves. We gave her our order, but being Sunday night, I guess they had run out of several of the items we requested as she kept saying it was a really busy weekend.  Great for them, not what we needed to hear over and over.... nnFast forward  minutes later when she brought us our salads.  Three out of  of them were OK, my fathers blue cheese dressing was the consistency of water and he asked for them to take the salad away.  The manager came over and said it must have been a bad batch of dressing and he was having the chef make more.  They brought him another salad and different dressing.  It was still not the blue cheese dressing that he had ever had, but he ate it.  nnThe dining experience was NOTHING like we had thought it to be.  We can handle a loud restaurant, but we were seated to the side of the wood fire grill and all night we kept getting interrupted by employees yelling orders to each other.  The wait person was pleasant enough, but she was off a beat at almost every step of the dinner.  When we needed her, she was no where to be found, when we had no need for her she stopped by.nnLike other reviewers have said, the portions were very sparse.  I get nouvelle cuisine, but this was not that.  It was sparse portions and to add insult to injury, all sides were alacarte.    The food prices were medium to high for what they were.nnSadly, we will probably not be giving this restaurant another chance as it failed on so many levels.  I assume that they must get it right now and again based on some of the more positive reviews.  All I can say is I hope you hit a good day the next time you want to spend almost . a person for a casual dinner out in Charlotte."
0,"Great food...horrible ownershipmanagement.  Your choice  you decide.  If you can put up with crappy service, a mouthy owner, very slow delivery of food, then you will enjoy a great menu of food.  The table next to us left as they had waited too long for their food.  I guess we were too patient.nnReminded me of Amys Baking Company."
0,"Two months later and Im still waiting for the car stereo case that came with the radio they installed, plus I spoke with Scott on  and he said he would look into it. Spoke to Kenneth yesterday and he had the negative attitude to tell me that a detachable stereo does not come with a case!! Thats like saying a the right shoe does not come without the left shoe.  A company says alot about the people they employ, and while Scott is VERY good and knowledgeable, there are some individuals who need more training and customer service at this location. nnIts okay Sterling, I just sent Allstate a message, they will contact you and  to fix he over spray. The last comment  and FACT is if you would have done the job right the first time, you would not have a bad business review. nnI will update my experience whenever my truck gets fixed. Next month , next year.......you tell me. Meanwhile Ill send corporate a message  to follow up."

Among the clothes they destroyeddamaged were a bespoke shirt and tailored pants.  nnI will be filing suit against them and their employees within the next few months regarding their conversion,  negligent supervision,  etc. nnIf you are an upset customer looking for redress or a journalist,  dont hesitate to contact me.nnAlso, if you are looking for an inexpensive alternative to ZIPS, go to the Giant Eagle on the Southside. Theyre great!"
0,"I would avoid this place. Gave them too many chances, they did not improve. n It took  guys driving my car to get it through the wash, pulling and tugging, they did not know how to start the car or release the push button hand breaksn Even after walking around the car at the final inspection, there were lots of marks and spots on the car, on a car that is  months oldn One time after running it through the VIP wash, had to take it back again because of nall the spots they leftnOf the three car washes in my area, they are ranked last. I will drive a bit further and get a good carwash. this is not worth the aggravation. nWhen I called and tried to give the manager Juan some feedback, he did not take it very well. Another reason I will not give them my business again. I will take my business back to Cobblestone, worth the drive and much better customer service."
0,"I was craving Indian food and this place was close by the office so I thought to give it a try though a coworker had a less than positive experience on her visit. nnI had the lunch special  chicken tikka and spinach puree with legumes and ordered togo. The online menu states that soup is included in the lunch special but when I asked about it they said not for togo orders that stipulation was not stated on their website. The person who took my order seemed a tad bit confused and did not really understand what I was saying.nnWhen I went to pick up, my food was waiting in a lockertype container and wasnt that hot. I opened the styrofoam box to find HALF a piece of naan. As a fan of Indian cuisine I was most looking forward to this part of the meal. The naan was thin and simply O.K. The portion was a bit small for . only  pieces of chicken and about a table spoon of veggies. The basmati rice lacked in flavor and disappointed as one of my favorite parts to Indian cuisine.nnAll in all it satisfied my instant craving for Indian food but would not go again due to the portion size and lack of flavor. nnIt was the epitome of the  star rating Meh. Ive experienced better."
0,Went in for some quick take out. The only person available to talk to couldnt answer any questions. She didnt the know what was in any of the dishes and she couldnt tell me what dishes the pictures were of on the menu. I finally just chose two dishes that I was already familiar with just because I was tired of hearing I dont know. I definitely will not be back to this establishment.
0,All looked good until their advertised hours werent what they say they are.  If you are hungry they stop serving food early so dont go! And they even closed the kitchen  minutes before that! Bad customer service.
0,"Hello Again!  I have written a review about Sushi Bomb before back in Nov , but this time, I have to say, I wont be going back   The last review I gave them was  out of ...Only a  cause of how slow the service was during lunch.  nnMy friends and I dined there last night March , .  It was a Friday evening and it was another couple and our son who is yr  old.  nnSo our bad journey began with slow service and a very very rude waitress.  I should have gotten her name there are only a few servers that work there  she was the slightly older skinnier Asian lady server.  The younger one with wavy hair was very very nice!  nnOur bill was over   All you can eat and drinks.  So for paying this kind of money at any restaurant for  people, would EQUAL     GREAT SERVICE!  Wrong.  Our reservations was for .  We did not get out of the restaurant until after pm.  This was not our choice because our son was ready long LONG before.  I told my friends that our lunch service was slow and given that the restaurant seemed busy, I suggested that we try and order all your rolls at one time.  We ordered most or rolls so we didnt have to wait as long.  However, we needed a couple more.  I guess when you order more after the first round, you will have to wait cause others will be priority over you... or so it seemed.  nnWhen I told the guy Hostwith a girly kind of hair cutnot trying to be mean, just didnt get his name and thats the only way I could describe him who said he is the manager, his explanation was and I quote the first round of sushi you probably had a fast sushi chef and they are all different, this time, you probably had a slower sushi chef and his speed is slower than the first guy that made your food   o  WHAT??   nnWe waited over minutes from when we ordered a couple more rolls before they came out after a couple complaints too.nnThe server would barely ask us what we wanted nor did she seem happy to be there.  She was in a bad mood.  I totally get it, we all have bad days and we have busy days too that can drive us to the ground, but when the economy is the way it is people seem to be pickier about where to eat or spend their money on, then I think customer service is going to help any business fail or succeed.  Bottom line, we should not have been treated the way we did.  nnWe asked for waters twice.nWe waited over  min. for her to take our order the first time.nWe had to keep asking for refills nWe asked for  cucumber salads in the beginning and never got them  until about almost pm cause they new at this point we were upset  we even said never mind on the cucumber salads nWe were treated horribly by our server the entire night with the exception of the HostManager  that other server that tried to make it better nOur rolls the second time took over min. to come out  we did not order anything different than the last time, with the exception of us ordering only  rolls  lot less than the first roundnnUnfortunately, because of all the series of events that happened last night with the slow service and the extremely rude server, etc. etc. Our entire group will not go back.  There are far more sushi places that would deserve our timemoney than this place.  nnI do not recommend this place to anyone with kids or anyone that wants to leave within less than  hours, especially for dinner.nnI do have to say the best roll there is Sex on the Beach.  nThe all you can drink Sapporo for . is a good deal.  nMake a reservation!!  We did and it helped but there were people waiting outside.nUnfortunately for us, all of these things though will not help us go back.  I rather drive all the way to I Love Sushi in Henderson that isnt an all you can eat and pay just as much or a little more because I know they are deserving of my business.  nnI hope someone from Sushi Bomb reads this because I hope you improve on your customer service!! nnJust a side note We tried to tip the other nice server cause she started to help us a little more at the end and she said they all have to share the money  community tips.  Where is the incentive to do better and be a better server and treat people better?  There really isnt with this type of tipping service.  nnOverall bad time and we all left frustrated.  Our night didnt end well and thats not right.   nSushi Bomb dropped a bomb on our night! It shook us up so much, they we are not going back!"
0,Buyer Beware! This store has some nice things but their prices are outrageous! I even lifted up a vase once that was marked higher than the original sticker on the bottom  they obviously forgot to remove the original. Their staff are really nasty sour people and walk around with noses in the air like they smell something bad about people who would buy less than new furniture. They also like to follow you around and tell you not to sit on the sofas. Skip this place!nRuth C

0,"hmm... I came to VEGAS to celebrate my th... thus being my first time to Sin City I was VERY UNIMPRESSED! Seriously with all the other nightclub choices... I wouldnt come here ever again. I was put on a guest list... but even still it was a  minute wait. Thanks to a friend, I was able to be escorted in. Although, I got a free show Sean Kingston performed... he did  songs and that was a wrap... Personally the long lines are not worth the wait. Plus, the decor was nothing fancy. Ive seen better clubs in SD. Im glad that I didnt pay to get in so I guess I didnt lose much except almost an hour of waiting just to get in!"
0,"Sadly, the service has slipped. Not enough help to wait on the customers. Wait staff was waiting tables, serving as cashiers and bussing tables. Slow to get drink refills, didnt offer to bring more chips. Food wasnt hot either. The place was a huge disappointment on our visit this week. We are not likely to return."
0,"Oh my goodness. I havent had a good experience with Chompies lately and its not just this location. The service is ALWAYS a hit or miss. I walked in last week when it was pretty slow and the two ladies standing around at the front didnt even say a simple hello. I asked them if we had to wait to be seated and without answering, they looked at each other with a smirk and nodded at the hostess to take care of us. nnNot the most welcoming feeling. When a customer asks you question, you answer their question. Simple as that. Ive been in the restaurant industry for awhile and I would never blow off or make my customers feel unwelcome the minute they walk in. nnOur server was alright, except for the fact we didnt get a single drink refill until she handed us our check...which implies that she didnt stop by to check on us at all. But hey, at least the food was on point."
0,"My friend and I were harassed by their staff person Mohamed last Friday Nov  around  PM.  My friend and I were on our way to meet friends for dinner and got in the cab line to go to our destination.  The worker, Mohamed, who hails the cabs and puts us in the cab that they EMPLOY, asked us if we were Call Girls with a gross tone and looking at us like we were meat.  We were both wearing jeans and tank tops and regardless of what we were wearing that is UNCALLED for.  My friend said Im a married women to him and he laughed at us and the cab driver was appalled that he said this as well and told us to call the hotel immediately.  nnWe looked up the number to Planet Hollywood and spoke to the front desk manager Joe Magid around  PM.  Joe was not helpful, I actually think he thought the situation was funny.  Its not funny, its rude and horrible that they let their staff treat their guests like that. Joe was not apologetic and didnt really seem like he wanted to take my call.  Joe claimed he would mention something to him but I dont think that he did because when I called to get Mohameds last name for all the complaints I will be writing, Guy Nason, the Bell Caption was not informed that this happened.   Guy was very nice and actually told me he would be speaking to Mohamed immediately about this situation, Mohamed should not be surprised because I told him I would be reporting him.n nAnyway back to Joe, he told me to drop by when I got back from our night to talk to him and when we did he was not working.  We asked to speak to the other front desk manager and the girl at the front desk asked what it was about.  We told her the story and she told us that we should take it as a compliment because we are good looking and he probably meant that.  Im sorry but I would never take are you call girls as a compliment and I cant believe she would say this.  What kind of people are they hiring at this hotel?  Anyway after we told her the story she claimed that the manager was in a meeting even though she never left the front area.  n nI will never stay at this hotel again!  Planet Hollywood should be ashamed of their workers.  Guy Nason did seem nice and concerned so I hope that he is actually speak with his worker, as for Mohamed, Joe, and the girl at the front desk that thinks being called a call girl is a compliment all need some training in the Sexual Harassment Department."

I live down the street and have tried this location   times and I can honestly say they have a terrible product. I mean come on, donuts is what you guys do and you are not doing it very well.

0,"The place is not very cool.  I cannot for the life of me understand why this place gets good reviews.  The food was honestly the worst food Ive ever had at a pricey restaurant, but I did like the environment."
0,"Absolutely wretched and incompetent billing department.  Overcharged four months in a row, called every month and was repeatedly told it would be fixed.  I went to American Express to file a dispute and at least they were able to reverse the four overcharges.  Even after that, I was randomly charged for a system upgrade that never happened.  I am considering filing a complaint with the better business bureau and the attorney general."
0,"This review is based on their billing practices only and their corp offices on Washington was not listed so I picked where I go for labs. This is a copy of the letter I sent to the BBB in regards to their billing. I am also contacting the AZ attorney generalnOn Wednesday August ,  I went in to get my blood drawn like I have been doing every month for the last year from your location at  S. th Street, Ste.  in Phoenix. After waiting  minutes the lady working in billing called me up and presented with a bill from  for ,.. I was in shock as I go in every month and this was never brought to my attention. She then proceeds to tell me they will not provide me services until the bill is paid.  I look at the address on the bill and it is completely wrong they dont have my apt. number on it and I had moved. I advised the billing lady that I updated my address online with you back in August of  and she was quite rude and didnt want to be bothered she pushed me off to your billing dept. I have End Stage Renal Failure and Sonora Quest is the only laboratory on my insurance and every bill this year has been submitted and paid by insurance.  Last year my job let me go because I was on LTD because of kidney failure and they advised me my insurance was good until Nov. . I only later found out it was cancelled in August of .  On Wednesday when she presented me the bill  ascensions were already in collection and  were not. I called customer service on Thursday August ,  and spoke to Kurt whom when I advised him of my situation, advised me he could make payment arrangements for  months which is almost . in order for me to continue to receive services from Sonora Quest. I get , once a month from disability. I cannot afford that. Kurt then promised me he would speak to his supervisor to see what he could do to make the payments affordable and he would call me back. HE NEVER CALLED ME BACK. I call back today and Kurt answered again, now I am told all the accessions are now in collections and they just rolled over so now I have to go to the lab to pay  percent of the balance to receive services from you guys. When I told him had you called me back when you said these would have not also went into collections. His response, It is what it is go to Lab Corp and how would you have paid it if I called you back First off Kurt is the WORST representative I have ever spoke to.  I admit I have a bill to pay but Sonora Quest has dropped the ball for the following reasonsn. You sent the bill to the wrong address even though I updated it with you and its funny RSI has the correct address. All my mail was forwarded also because I received  bills from you months ago from the same time frame and they got to me and I paid them.n. Why was I not informed of this debt when I go in EVERY month for bloodwork? Why was it almost a year later that I am informed?n. Since KURT never called me as promised the other  ascensions are now in collections because he dropped the ball and never even apologized.n. You provide a lifesaving service how can you not may arrangements more affordable for people and deny them services? Hospitals and Doctors all make arrangements.nIt is because of Sonora Quests negligence I was not able to address these bills in a timely fashion.  I dont even know the name of the girl who does the billing at location she does not wear a name tag. By the grace of god I was able to pay  percent of my bill and make arrangements with RSI to pay the rest and now able to receive services from you guys since you are the only ones on my insurance. I am also sending a copy of this to the AZ Attorney General in regards to your billing practices and the way you treat customers who need your services. I want action taken against Kurt got the way I was treated on the phone and the fact he never followed with me."

I said I just had a regular  non periodontal disease cleaning at the end of Oct  with my regular dentist and he did not say anything about periodontal disease.   He said my gums were in good shape.  nnI did not have any bleeding or inflamed gums when I entered the Stone Creek office that day March ,  and I had gotten other teeth cleanings thru Groupon, where another hygenist spent  hour cleaning my teeth and she gave me one of the best cleanings I ever had in my life.   No one in that office mentioned periodontal disease.n nHow was I to know how far down the Stone Creek hygienist was pushing that probe down HARD to exaggerate measure my gum pockets.  When I asked this question, Stone Creek hygienist said that then it would hurt me if she pushed down further than necessary. Because she is in my mouth, I cannot see what she is doing with my own eyes.  She could call every  or  pocket and  or  so that I would have periodontal disease.  n nAs a result, Stone Creek Dental refused to clean my teeth.   Stone Creek said my periodontal disease was so severe that they said that I had to have root planing and scaling this is the most drastic treatment of  levels, the first level is regular cleaning which is what I had  months before.   Stone Creek  gave me a treatment plan, that they would charge me . to treat my periodontal disease.nnWhen I said what about the teeth whitening, office told me that is ONLY for people who get their teeth cleaned there, and as you will see below, they wanted . to clean my teeth in that office.   So I didnt get teeth whitening either.n nAnd when I asked for my Xrays, they told me they would only give me my Xrays if I paid another  for duplication fee. So I did not get my Xrays either.  n nWhen I got my statement, showing what they had done, they listed that they did prophylactic cleaning and free teeth whitening, the exam, perio charting, and put . charges.  However I did not get the cleaning or teeth whitening, it only SAYS so on the paperwork I walked out with.n nSo in the following . weeks, I made appointments with THREE other dentists, maybe four, I forgot. nNot a one perio probe in other dental offices matched the severity of Stone Creek.  One of the dentists told me that Stone Creek was scamming me.  The other dentists would not comment about another office.  They all measured my pockets  and , but not  and  that Stone Creek said they measured in the SAME TEETH and the SAME places in the gums next to those teeth.  The other offices said  and  pockets are not unusual for age , especially around the molars.  n nI have at hand the four perio charts that the other dental offices did as a second, third and fourth opinion for me,  When I asked and told the same story about what happened at Stone Creek, ALL THE DENTISTS told me that I did not need the root planing and scaling that Stone Creek was trying to charge me almost  for.  In the end I only got the dental exam from Stone Creek office, which is the least thing that I needed out of that deal.  I felt they were bait and switch when you get in their office.  I felt cheated."
0,The car wash is literally a dump. Ive had my car washes here  times and each time something is wrong. The cars dirty. They forgot to vacuum the rear carpets.

0,"I feel badly writing this review because my waitress was helpful and very friendly. However, everything else was terrible. The haus brat tastes mostly like dried oregano.

0,"Horrible service. Theyre lucky to get  star. Because of the incompetent people that work here, the quality of the food is highly affected. Ordered  salads, the amount of meat is inconsistent, beans are watery because its almost gone  they didnt refill it, lettuce from bucket was also watery when they refill it, didnt bother to shake extra water. So the salads were like soup. Asian guy employee was so irritated that he could just careless. The owner of this place should think of revamping hisher staff. Felipe"

There is one nice person that works here, Deshawn, she is the receptionist at the front desk and a total sweetheart.nnThis is the third Life Care Center in Phoenix that Ive encountered.

0,The menu has changed most of the items are no loner available. No more fried smores. Maybe  desserts are left on the menu. Prices seem higher for much less food options. Huge dissappointment. As a local excited to try this place I am sad to say I will not be going back.
0,"The worst service ever!nnI went there tonight for dinner with my wife, son and parents.  The waiter forgot to put my wifes order in it was a salad.

I asked two other employees to send our waiter over, and  minutes later It wasnt busy either a different waiter came by and asked what we needed.nnWe let him know that the salad hadnt come out, and it has now been  minutes since our food was delivered.  They let us know it would be out right away, and  minutes later we still hadnt seen it.  nnMy parents and son ate their food, mine was now cold.  Finally we told them to keep the salad, and they could also keep my uneaten burger, and that I would not be paying for either.nnThey agreed and I left a  tip, which was  more than the waiter deserved.  Thank you for wasting  minutes of my night!  There are plenty of other local places like Azools that will get my business in the future."
0,"My husband ordered take out for us last week. I ordered the chicken burrito bowl, the chicken was very hard and chewy, the guacomole had some brown spots. It tasted disgusting, I had a few bites and threw it away. Then got very sick with food poisoning symptoms for the next   days. In all fairness my husband ordered a steak burrito and liked it. I normally go to the chipolte  baseline and stapley in Gilbert, there food everytime is AMAZING AND FRESH!"
0,"Every time we come to the Gilbert location, we leave disappointed. The Jack Daniels is always watered down even when ordered neat. There are zero substitutions allowed on sampler platters an outdated practice, not typical in most bars and restaurants in this area, sometimes a cover charge on PPV nights. The manager even did a shot special wheel spin, and then moved it from the Crown Royal which it landed on to a schapps shot cheaper liquor. Sometimes not always the wings are barely covered in sauce and we have to ask for some on the side. We are regulars, and tried to discuss things with the manager on site, but he is usually less than receptive, and more than ready to blame corporate."
0,"It makes me sad to write this review because I used to love Gotham, but that ship seems to have sailed. Just now, I pulled on their doors to get a bagel at about pm on a Wednesday and the door was locked. No sign, no nothing and the guy at the counter just stared at me. nnRewind to about  months ago. Again, I went in after the lunch rush because that is when my scheduled lunch is to get a bagel. There were  other customers and probably  people working. The owner was counting money out of the drawer. He ignored me for a few seconds, glanced up, and then said, Shell help you and gestured toward the girl behind him. She looked surprised but jumped to help me. As I waited for my sandwich, I noticed how dirty everything was. Im sure they had been busy but it was dead by this point. Finally, I go to the womens bathroom and after using it, find out that the toilet is broken. No sign, no nothing. nnAre their bagelssandwicheseverything delicious? Hell yes. Im just starting to wonder if its worth it. The owner should stop counting money and tighten up his biz a little."
0,I was really disappointed. The food was very dry. Not fresh at all. The rice and beans were so dry not even salsa was able to bring them back from the dead. I ordered the chicken burrito. The chicken was really gross tasting. It wouldnt let me give zero stars thats why it gets one.
0,"We were told the Mandalay Bayside had an awesome seafood buffet someone lied to us. nnVery small selection of food. You could tell the food had been sitting for awhile bc certain ones that had sauces had this film on the surface.

0,"I checked out the yelp reviews before I headed over to TKs with my husband and daughter.  You would think a  dinner on Friday with an empty restaurant would yield great service.  Not so.  We had to wave over a couple of service runners to get any attention.   The iced tea came  no ice and no offer for any sweetner or a spoon.  The food was ok and we ordered the Apple Pie dessert but wasnt told it would take an additional  minutes to arrive.  It wasnt worth the wait or calories.  The tavern will also through you off  not really tavern  Just a big room with tables, chairs and a wooden floor that projects noise.  Too many other choices in this bustling quarter to return.

0,"Eh, theres definitely plenty of better options in Vegas.

0,"Ugh, I dont know why I tried this place.  Ive been to one other European Wax Center, and it was a horrible experience and I was hoping it was just a fluke.

I think shell do great.  quite the opposite of my experience at the other location, where the girl didnt even close the door to our room initially  and I was getting a brazilian! WTF?.nnMy problem with this place is the wax I think.  I had my underarms and lower legs waxed, and much of the hair is still there.  When I go through the pain of waxing, I expect to come away with silky smooth skin, and that is not the case with European Wax Center I have gone to many other salons for waxing and always leave with smooth hairfree skin!.  It was the same thing last time I went at a different location on Val Vista, so at this point Im assuming its the product they use.nnDisappointing to say the least."
0,"The only reason my husband and I had dinner here is we had been up and down the Strip, gambling and drinking since  AM, and the line for the Avenue Cafe was too long. We didnt wait very long, and our food was at least hot and flavorful when it came out. Husband had a pot roast, I had some type of pasta that was a bit too spicy. The tomatobasil bisque was good. Prices were ridiculous for what you got. VERY loud and yes the waterfall will get you a little wet. Im thinking if Id had three less margaritas we could have stood in line at the other cafe. In short, probably really great for kids, but then who brings kids to Sin City? Apparently plenty of people, as we saw the week we were there. Whatever."
0,"A combination of food that only just met my expectations and service that severely disappointed, forced me to deliver a star rating. nnThey sat us in the back corner of the restaurant tucked next to where the soda dispenser and the dish cart are. The fact that they sat us here was one thing, but they were uncomfortably unaccommodating when I asked to move.  After several minutes of awkwardly standing in the middle of the restaurant searching for a new table, we finally found one near our original seat. nnThis immediate poor experience could have been redeemed if the food was overwhelmingly delicious, but unfortunately that was not the case. The chicken was chewy and the sushi was served dangerously lukewarm. Other than those two items, most of the food was just mediocre. There was nothing tasty enough to drive me back to eat here again. nnBuffet at Asia is a great place to go if you are comfortable with dealing with poor service while receiving mediocre food. I would not recommend this place to any one."
0,"My husband and I stayed here over the th of July weekend. We were so looking forward to the stay after looking at the website and loved that each room had a kitchen and that the resort had no casino.  In the past weve stayed at other nice resorthotels in Vegas that had similar set up without the casino and checkin was always so much faster and easier. Vdara disappointed us from the get go. First the entrance to the hotel is difficult to find even on the strip. The signs are tiny, the road takes you in loops and is overall a BIG headache. Most hotels on the strip have a back entrance, not this one. The only way in is from the Strip. That sucks considering the traffic on the strip is horrible. It can take you  minutes to go one block! Upon finally getting to the hotel, the only way to park is wvalet. No self parking? Come on! Sometimes I dont feel like tipping everybody  times a day! But Vdara says thats what the resort fee is for. Yeah, right. So the checkin counter was a pain in the ass.  long ass lines.  Why dont they get smart and make one line for all of us to stand in. That way we can go to the first available person? nnOn to the room. The furnishings are nice and modern. But there were some major issues with the room.  No pots, pans, cups, utensils, etc. in the kitchen. Completely bare when you open the cupboards. You have to call housekeeping to bring each and every stinking thing you want up and that takes them at least  minutes. Such an inconvenience, when I wanted a cup of tea like an hour ago! They dont even give you a coffee maker. Also, the refrigerator is the size of a medicine cabinet. I kid you not. Go ahead and try to fit a few things, and you will see how ridiculously small this is.  Bathroom door was one of those sliding doors. Ours was already broken and the lock didnt even work bc it wouldnt slide all the way closed.  The blackout shades are broken into  sections and each section has a  inch gap in between that lets in all the bright sun in the morning. Forget about sleeping in past am, unless you put a pillow over your head.  No robes in the room. You have to call housekeeping to bring it up and that takes  minutes. Again, a pain when you wanted to use it a  min ago and are now waiting to take a shower bc the robes havent arrived. nnSo one morning since there is no coffee maker, my husband goes down to the only cafe in the whole hotel to grab a cup of coffee. The line was about  people long and he asked the cashier if he can just order a cup. She tells him no, and he has to wait in the big a line. Another person asks, same answer.. wait in the big a line. So a third person asks and the person says OK. WTH? By the time my husband gets to the front of the line he tells the guy they should be consistent or have a line just for coffee.  The guy rolls his eyes and shrugs with a look like I dont give an F! So my husband goes to the front desk to see if they have a comment card he can write on. They tell him No, we dont have one. You can fill out an online survey that we will email you. Husband tells front desk, I have my comment fresh in my mind and want to write it down now. Front desk tells him Go write it on the room stationary.  Husband is pissed, but goes up to the room and finds there is no room stationary. Only the little x notepad. So my husband writes his complaint on the little notepad and said he expects a call or email from their manager. Husband turns the card in to the front desk. Over a week later, we still have not received any response from Vdara. This place just sucks and they dont care about the customer at all.  Vegas is a hospitality town. We had great customer service everywhere but here and we go to Vegas at least  times a year.  Go somewhere else until Vdara improves their customer service. Trust me. These little things add up to a frustrating stay anywhere. We will not be returning. Vdara, you lost our business."
0,"Would have given this place more stars for the food if it hadnt been for the horrid, disorganized hour and a half wait to be seated.  All it did was make our entire group angry and everyone vow to never come there again.  Whomever came up with the idea of multiple pay stations and lines all waiting simultaneously to be seated must have been touched and the managerowner that accepted the plan should be fired or shot.  All I can say is CHAOS!!  nnWe could clearly see lots of empty tables that were vacant for  or more minutes, yet at points the line was not moving at all for long periods of time.  The heat and the noise were incredible.nnOnce you finally get to the pay station, you are forced to stand in another line waiting for a hostess to seat you.  We watched while they took groups out of other lines multiple times and never even looked at our line.  The whole system is idiotic and not conducive to a nice dining experience.  You could tell that the staff itself was overwhelmed by the way things worked and just didnt care about the customers wait.  No sense of urgency or eye contact.nnThe food WAS NOT worth the wait and frustration."

The bartender was in the process of making a drink only to find out it was the wrong one that someone else had ordered and set it aside.... I ordered the nGrapefruit Basil Martini about  min. later and low and behold, guess which drink he handed me..... yep, the one pushed to the side.  Really cant believe he did that knowing I was sitting there when the mistake occurred and that I overheard everything. Thanks, Ill pass... So, I ordered something else only to get Half a drink in a small squatty goblet type glass they use. Needless to say, not a great start.nnI ordered the caesar salad...

0,"Came here on a Thursday night and we got in pretty fast since we were there early. The price for their dinner buffet is, by far, the cheapest Ive encountered. All you can drink alcohol is a major plus, serving beer and wine.nnThe Asian selection of the buffet was okay, but the rest were just subpar. The prime rib was too dry even though it was medium rare. The tri tip was chewy and the eclairs and cream puffs tasted like its been refrigerated for a while. Went here because of the raves from family and friends but overall, I was disappointed.  Maybe I just expected too much..."
0,"My usual beef about this place is that it always looks disheveled and the registers are undermaned. This afternoon, the store was neatly organized, and for once there wasnt a huge line at the registers.nIm convinced there are some people who look great in Old Navy clothes, and I wish I did because their stuff is inexpensive, trendy, and kind of cute. However, no matter how many times I give them a try, nothing seems to work out.

0,"I recently decided to give Cant Stop Smokin a try after hearing good things from a coworker and the fact that they were running a Groupon special also helped!. I ordered a family meal to go. The girl who took my order over the phone was pleasant, however she didnt seem very knowledgeable and after I gave her my whole order she said Let me make sure we have everything you ordered....weve been running out of stuff a lot lately! I feel like that is a really weird thing to tell a customer, but  ok...thanks for checking! I was placed on a short hold and she returned to tell me that YES! they had the  things I ordered in stock! Ok, then!nnI accidentally pulled into the parking lot of Rudys barbecue, which is right across the street, and the place was packed! I realized I was in the wrong parking lot and quickly crossed over to Cant Stop Smokin, whos parking lot was completely empty. Bad sign. I entered the restaurant and there was only one other person in there who was placing an order at the meat counter. The man behind the counter seemed bored senseless and was not even attempting to provide any kind of customer service. I stood around for a moment before a girl walked up to a register and asked if she could help me. She was pleasant and quickly went to the back to grab my food. Before she came back, the other customer finished placing his order and his food was brought to the register. The girl subsequently returned with my food but seemed baffled as to why there was someone elses food at the counter. She had to call another worker over to solve the dilemma and it took both of them to figure out how to proceed. I was finally able to pay with my Groupon..if not for the fact that I had already purchased the Groupon, I probably wouldve just went to Rudys and sent on my way. While Cant Stop Smokin is about  minutes from my job, it was a  minute drive home. Halfway home I thought I should probably check to make sure everything I ordered is in this bag! my own fault for not checking at the restaurant, I suppose and I realized one of my sides wasnt there. I didnt feel like going back, and since I paid with a Groupon, I figured Oh well, but its a little annoying that I only ordered  things and they managed to forget one of them!nnAll of that being said, the food was pretty good. If I had to recommend a place, I would prefer Joes Real BBQ or even Famous Daves over this place, but it wasnt bad food. Had it not been for the quality of the food, I wouldve only given this place  star. But I doubt Ill ever go back..."
0,"Went here with  coworkers for lunch on a Friday afternoon, man what a waste of time. I came from California to eat this? Staff were EXTREMELY friendly almost over the top, but the service was absolutely terrible. We didnt order any of the complicated and long preparation time items and it took nearly  minutes to get our food  and the restaurant was barely  full. nnI got the baked pesto ziti with chicken. It was all right, nothing to write home about. Would be great for pesto lovers as its drenched in it. The redeeming factor was that the grilled chicken addon gives you A LOT of chicken breast for your  bucks. The bread bowl was also a little disconcertingnnThey forgot to input my coworkers order slice of pepperoni pizza into the computer and it took an extra  minutes after the rest of us got our food to prepare that. Seriously?  minutes for  slice of the most common pizza ever served?! Other coworker got the Big Rig Rigatoni and she said it was pretty good. Definitely looked better than my dish.nnOverall this reminded me of the typical American chainish restaurant with the HUGE portions.

At the register I presented the ecoupons, along with the instore coupons  the cashier couldnt get the ecoupons to scan, she started talking about how there are so many scams with the ecoupons they have to be careful and do I still want the groceries anyway? She wanted me to buy the groceries then stand in line at customer service and get a refund I told her that I would cancel the order, so she transferred my order up to customer service. After I wait my turn, the customer service cashier tries to scan with no luck, I asked her to ask the manager, when she returned she let me know that her manager said no to taking the coupons I had to request them back from her I canceled the order, my child cried because the order contained treats for her, I cried in the parking lot for the lost time, embarrassment  frustration.nnI then went to WalMart on Lindsay and McKellips they price matched Safeways sales and others so I shopped for more than the original order at Safeway, at the register the kid scanned all of the ecoupons on the st try!"
0,"Eh.  This is the second Fatburger I have been to, as I usually like to give mediocre a second try in case it was a fluke.  Nope, sorry Fatburger you are just bland.  The burger was lacking excitement.  Bland was the theme of the day here.  The prices were way out of line for the end product.  Oh well."
0,The service here is wonderful and everyone is super nice BUT the food is mediocre at best. I LOVE breakfast and this place just doesnt satisfy. They do have AMAZING banana but bread muffin and their potatoes are perfectly seasoned yum but Pancakes  French Toast are nothing special. Bacon is thin and greasy its the thickness and quality that are lacking grease is to be expected sausage always comes pink and undercooked. Syrup can make or break you and I think it may be the syrup that throws me. Id recommend Original Pancake House over this place any day and they are right around the corner.
0,"Two stars only because Im compassionate. Lunch today using a Groupon I live in Buckeye so if it wasnt for Groupon I would not go out of my way to give places way off the freeway corridor a shot unless I was in their neighborhood.  We were five miles from Ali Baba today so it was worth a try.  I was very disappointed.  The woman who works in the grocery next door was very personable, I went in there first looking for Zartar bread. She directed me to the bakery that doubles as the dining room.  The cases were sparse, but what was on display looked good.  The menu seemed promising.  My companion had the ubiquitous gyro with fries and a soft drink. I ordered the Ali Baba plate with an order of the yogurtcucumber salad on the side, to eat with my entree much as a raita is eaten with Indian cuisine.nnTo mimic others, the service was ridiculously slow.  Whoever is working their line must not have professional food service experience, or the kitchen is set up to prepare food for only one table at a time.  I got the impression that they are understaffed, to put it conservatively.  When asked how I wished the meats on my platter prepared, I said I wanted the chicken cooked to  degrees but not cooked to death, and the lamb and kufta medium.  When the food was finally served, the meats had been removed from the skewers.  There were four one inch cubes of chicken, four one inch cubes of lamb, and a six inch by one inch by quarter inch high strip of kofta seasoned ground beef that is formed into oblongs or flatted out on a flat skewer and cooked over a grill.  All the meat was dried out and way overcooked, and I mean way overcooked.  I know that the middle east is not homogenous, and recipes vary, but I wish the kufta was seasoned more robustly with the spices that are found in Egyptian kofta. The seasoning was rather one note. The rice was cooked to perfection and had a good flavor, and there were some middle eastern pickles like strips of turnip pickled in beet juice, a pepperoncini, and cherry pepper slices.  Bread is only served upon request a nod to our American carb conscious diet, but kind of weird for a middle eastern restaurant.  My experience in the middle east was one where there were huge slabs of bread served with everything.  My yogurt and cucumber salad with mint was amenable, I could have done without the olive oil dripped on top because it was a bitter olive oil, not fruity.nnSo, because of the Groupon, the way I look at it is that my entree cost five bucks instead of , excluding my cucumber yogurt salad.  I wasnt cheap with the tip, the bill before the discount was twenty six dollars and change and I tipped ..  I dont hold servers responsible for kitchen mistakes, at least not in an environment where the servers dont have any power to change the speed at which the food comes out.nnThe worst of it all is that instead of finding a place not too far from home where I can find all my favorite items from the middle east, I found a place that I cant justify the drive to visit in order to give them a second chance.  Its too bad, some of the best food I have ever eaten has been at deli bakerys that put up a few tables in the corner.nnSo, guess I have to wait until the next time I fly back east and then hit the Reading Terminal Market in Philly if I want perfectly cooked kufta, kebabs, and chicken.nBummer..............."
0,"For some reason I was mad craving tacos so I checked on Yelp and found this was the closest one that was open. This eatery is located at the back of the Ballys casino, next to the new Drais location. It is a pretty big space... we opted to sit at the bar and order some grub. I got  shredded beef tacos and my friend got an order of fries and a tall Bud Lite. The fries were pretty standard, and the tall Bud Light I believe was like ... pretty good deal! The tacos were  each, but really really blehhhhh. No flavor whatsoever. I ate all three anyways because I was super hungry. Overall, it was an okay spot that is open late with good prices... next time Ill try to find another taco spot before coming here. Thanks!"
0,"Do NOT sign the paper that says you will be charged . a day. When we went, the guy at the front desk said you already paid for the room already so this is just a formality. SUCH a liar and its just  to get you checked in as quickly as possible since there is always a line of people waiting. nnThe room was barely functional. On Sunday morning there was no hot water. Our TV didnt work just static and when we called it in, the repairman they promised didnt show up. EVER. At least the bed and comforter were okay.nnThe only reason this doesnt get  star is because I guess you get what you pay for. We didnt pay much for it and you shouldnt pay much for Vegas in this down economy so I guess it sufficed. night for the weekend only gets you a functional bed, I guess. I liked that we got a room in the tower closest to the north parking garage entrance. It was a little tricky finding the entrance to the north parking garage since its where the employees park too entrance is on Fairfield, but it was so nice not having to walk through the casino to get to our room."
0,They advertise macaroni and cheese and apple fries but they dont have that and they didnt even tell me. When I ordered apple fries I go through and I get apple slices with peels. For my child who is a year old thats not going to cut it with the peels. When I asked them about it they said sorry that they no longer sell it. I asked them why they advertise it and they said that it was because of corporate and not their particular facility. Not cool. And not customer friendly.
0,"Sick is the only word to describe. This place made me want to call a health inspector right away. The place smelled strongly of cleaning fluid when I entered, but the place was filthy....how does that happen? My daughter has been begging to go here, but I dont remember it being so bad. There was food all over the floor, spill signs everywhere, trash, dirty tables, etc. I ate some chicken that was goodish, I had some more and spit it out cuz it was pinkish inside. I was scared of the shrimp. The salad bar was horrendous. Yellowbrown iceberg with warmish veggies and dressings. ..yum sounds so good. coagulated mac and cheese and burned pizza. The stuff looks like its been sitting there since . Dirty plates, silverware, walls, floors, everything! Nobody bussed our table,  dirty plates and not one of them moved. Coke was out, ice ran out, cups ran out. I have never felt so dirty after going to a restaurant, I need a shower. I can see, however, by the clientele that this is up to some peoples standards. A guy walked next to me, dropped his straw, left it, said oh well and got a new one. I think the bum sitting next to me was the cleanest one, since he licked his plate and stacked them neatly. The food here is just gross, all fried, canned, and bagged and probably unsafe. I would rather go to Golden Corral or Sweet tomatoes. Never again, Hometown. Never."
0,"I will not stay here again. I was on a business trip with colleagues and it seemed like it was one problem after another. For one, the valet is not quick and speedy. The phone operators are unhelpful. The people at the front desk are ok, but could still provide better customer service. n nProblem  Operator wouldnt help me get my laundry from the bell desk, and kept insisting that laundry couldnt be picked up at am even though a couple days before I had picked it up that early... so I went to the front desk and they had someone pick it up for me.nnProblem  There was no microwave in the room, I thought with this place being a suite theyd at least have that. They did however have a mini fridge. When I requested a microwave be brought up to my room, the maid who came in, LET HERSELF IN! I was in the restroom, came outside and she was there setting up the microwave. NOT COOL. nnProblem  After coming home from a long day of work, the room was cleaned, and a few tshirts Id left on the bed, where on THE FLOOR.nnProblem  Go into the bathroom, after I see my shirts on the floor, and they MOVED MY MAKEUP AND TOILETRIES! Touching my stuff is one of my pet peeves, before Ive left my stuff on the counter at hotels and it was never touched.nnProblem  NO FREE WIFI IN ROOMS! . per day. OH PLEASE, I dont think so.nnTHERE ARE PLENTY OF BETTER DEALSHOTELS IN VEGAS. Dont waste your money on this one. I only stayed here because it was chosen for me by the company I work for."
0,"Scam!!!!!nnLike the others have said, yet for some reason I ignored, this place is a scam.nnHere is the scam  Priceline catagorizes this hotel as  stars. For comparison, Luxor is  . nnI placed a bid for a  star hotel for  a night on weekends. Thought how could I go wrong? Priceline gave us The Westin as our winning bid. We got there and although the hotel rate was , they added all these fees, such as  per night recreation fee and . Visa Fee, etc.nnGood god!!!!! Apparently all a hotel has to do to scam priceline is to list a low rate and then they will be lower than other hotels. Then just add all these fees and that bumps up their revenue. Scam!!!!nnAs for the hotel  it sucks. My sister did not have hot water and upon checkin we had a very rude guy. Plus about  normal city blocks away from strip not one  dont be fooled and you have to walk past garbage to get to the action.nnHorrible!nnPlatnium Dunes right across streets, that place had only a partial staff when I was there but not all the hidden charges.nnInsulted my intelligence and I cant believe priceline allows this, it undermines all customer faith in their bidding system."
0,"Food is ok. It just gets worse every time. I only go there cause is near by. People work there are rude and dishonest. They made a mistake on my Togo order, which Im ok with it, everyone makes mistake. I called back to let them know about incorrect order. There wasnt even a sorry.... They said that it was impossible they made a mistake. Well... I guess in their mind... Ive made a mistake. I wasnt in the mood to argue, but, the lady answer sure is."
0,"Yuck I have avoided this Subway like the plague. Its too bad that this location is the most conveniently on the way to my job.  nnI literally walk past this Subway  times a week.  Even at pm its never packed there for lunch and the reason why is  because their sandwiches stink. nnWhen I say gross I mean that the standards for food are as low as the standards for cleaning. nnThe attitude of the workers here is just pitiful. The dont care about making a good sandwich nor do they care about keeping the place clean. What a wreck. nnAs some one who eats at Subway  times a week I feel entitled to my opinion, avoid this subway."

0,"Ive rented from Dollar at this location several times. Its busy, understaffed and disorganized. I tolerate it as theyre often the least expensive rental car. Sometimes the line in the garage is long and the lone employee assigning car just sends you to an area of the garage to pick out a car. If left to my own to select a car, Ill wander into the premium area, even though my rental is for a fullsize car. Left with a convertible once....no one said anything. Other times, Ive ended up in a minivan. One thing for certain, if you rent a Dodge Charger or similar, youll be driving similar. I think that dollar must own three Chargers in the entire country! Id prefer Hertz, but if I cant get a discount at Hertz, a weekly rental is in excess of . more than Dollar. Bottom line, I tolerate Dollar, and while Ive suffered inconveniences, theyve never been a horrible experience."
0,We are current renters here but if you are thinking about this place beware !!! When someone was parked in our space we asked them what we should do and they told us to park in any reserved space so we did and our car was towed !! We contacted the office and Kevin in the office told us we should have parked in a new tenant space. This is not what they told us to do ! We dont even know where these spaces are anyway !!  They refused to get our car back for us or pay the impound fees. Also! all they had to do was to look up the license plate and they would know who the car belonged to and could have called us ! I guess that would have been to easy. Things were ok when we moved in but as soon as we put in our notice that we were moving everything changed !! I would not recommend this place to anyone because they take no responsibility when they are clearly wrong ! If you want to contact me on more about this undesirable place please call me. This place is nothing but pure crap ! Expensive too !! There are so many other choices available to rent downtown that Im sure are a hole lot better ! nJane Costanza and Jack Woodall apartment
0,"The people who work here are nice, but the waiting room is ghetto. I made an appointment for between seven and eight am, and they lost it but would still fit me in.  It wasnt a good fit. I had to wait two hours after getting there at  am. But so did everyone else. Looked like they had a lot of time on their hands, anyway.nnVet was really good with the dogs, nice guy. After I tried to pay, the harried receptionist screwed up payment with the credit card, or the machine had a problem, or I dunno what, but it took an additional  minutes. I think she was sick, or allergic to animals. Probably not the best career choice for her.  I can replace her with an automatic terminal if they want. She had to handwrite a visa pay slip for me to sign, which didnt fill me with the warm fuzzies, and added to that ghetto feeling. nnI ran out of there after signing the slip like an escapee from an Ebola  quarantine zone.  Somebody else called the place, the best kept secret in AZ. Some secrets should probably stay buried."
0,"I had the misfortune of going to this Einstein Bagels this past weekend.  As I bit into my bagel sandwich I realized that something about the texture just wasnt right.  That was because there was a long brown hair wrapped up in the turkey and avocado.  Disgusting!  The staff promptly made me another sandwich which I choked down while trying to not think about the hair fortunately, it wasnt a short and curly that I had nearly just ingested.  As I opened the fruit cup the first thing I noticed was a fury grape.  Yeah, the fresh fruit had mold on it.  The strawberries were old and nasty.  Needless to say, I threw the fruit out.  nnThe quality of the food here is absolutely unacceptable.  I will never eat here again."
0,"I had the fried chicken, which wasnt impressive.  A little bit of seasoning or something would be nice.  I had the meal, which included dessert.

0,"If I could give no stars to an establishment, this place would be at the top of my list.  My awful experience went as followsnnI was in Vegas on  and had a craving for shawarma.  I Yelped some nearby shawarma places and decided on Shawarma Vegas due to its close proximity and the good reviews that it had gotten despite its somewhat pricey menu.  I noticed on Yelp that it closes at pm on Fridays, but it was only  so I figured I was in the clear.  nnI walked in and saw a woman behind the counter frantically scooping some food.  No greeting, hello, eye contact, nor nod of acknowledgement of my presence.  I began looking at the menu overhead to decide what I wanted.  The woman then says to me in a raised voice for no apparent reason because there was no music or any other customers to talk over , WERE CLOSED.  WHAT YOU WANT?  I was a little startled by her greeting and also surprised that they were already closed considering that it said on Yelp that they close at pm on Fridays and that it said on Shawarma Vegass website that theyre open from , MonFri confusing I know.  Surprised by the fact that she said that they were closed, I replied, Oh, youre closed?  Her reply to me in an even more irritated tone again was, WHAT YOU WANT?  Appalled by her sheer rudeness, I calmly responded with Nothing from here., turned around and walked right out the door.  I had never been so rudely treated at an establishment where I was a hungry patron willing to pay . for supposed good chicken shawarma in pita bread.nnI see the reviews on Yelp where fellow reviewers talk about the great and friendly customer service from this place.  Its gotta be a joke.  I seriously dont know where to begin to explain how upset I was at the treatment that I received.  Needless to say, I will never come here again the next time that Im in Vegas and will adamantly discourage any and all Vegas friends from patronizing this establishment."

We lived to regret it.nnThe salsa that came with the complimentary chips was, I admit, very good. So was the fresh guacamole. Sadly, it was downhill from there on in.nnThe biggest complaint, from the whole group, was how salty all the food was. My experience was of very ordinary diner food served with little real care. The presentation was sloppy and some of the plates looked like theyd been sitting around for a while.nnThe next morning, when our friend surfaced, his only comment was How did we end up at Gonzalez y Gonzalez.

I state what I will pay and if they can do it fine, if not, I am out of there. To this point it was going as I wanted.nnI wrote a check for the car and off we drive. Two days later they call and say they lost our check, can we give them another. I tell them no, find it. They call again and this time I tell them if I write another check I expect another car. Finally I am in the area so I drop off a check, I just like messing with them. Two more days pass and the sales man who sold us our vehicle calls to ask if we have decided if we want to buy or not. I reminded him that we already bought a car from him. His response is, huh, um, huh, OK and hangs up. A week passes and he again calls to see if we are ready to buy. So once again a reminder is in order. in the week after we got about five letters to remind us they are still there when we decide we are ready to purchase a new car.

I told the lady why I was returning it and she got really snippy at me, letting me know that of course it wouldnt ruin my hair they wouldnt sell it if it did! Err.. Ok, I guess all those people with ruined hair are totally wrong. Whatever. You ask for help choosing a product.. And not a single person there actually knows anything about their products.

We had reservations, but still waited in  degree heat for  minutes to be sat by what must be temps because they were so rude no fancy hotel would have hired them normally. We then found out Mimosas and Champagne were not included! I dont even drink them, but how could  NOT include at least  glass?nnNobody ever offered us coffee, and the juices they had out were warm. Our water glasses were empty immediately and only refilled when we asked. Did I mention it was  degrees  how could you not be filling water glasses and offering cold juice!?nnThe food they had was good, but there honestly wasnt much of a selection of typical brunch food. No eggs Benedict, no cheese tray, the fruit offering was less than whats in my fridge at home, no chicken or fish which is tough if you dont eat red meat, very few veggies, and what they claimed was a Mexican food section had beef only, no enchiladas, beans or even rice!nnThere were plenty of desserts, but most were bland. They didnt have ice cream or any cold desserts like youd expect on a hot day. nnAgain, what they had was good, and if this had been a  brunch on a nonholiday it would have been fine. For Easter when youre trying to enjoy a nice meal with family, it was very disappointing!"
0,"Tried this place out for lunch with a friend and as you can tell by my star rating, wasnt too excited about it. The service was friendly, fast and we each had a  off coupon so that was nice. I ordered a falafel wrap and my friend got the veggie Kebob plate. The food did not impress me. The falafel wrap had  small falafel with some plain chopped lettuce tucked into a pita bread. There was a little bit of a greenish sauce but it was tasteless. My wrap was accompanied by some chopped and seasoned onions as well as a small bit of lettuce greens and a large lemon wedge. THANK GOODNESS FOR THE LEMON WEDGE! I ended up covering my meal in the lemon juice to give it some flavor. My meal was far from awful but was very bland and compared to their competitor down the street...no question, I will not be switching Falafel places. While I did not try the veggie Kebob it did not impress my friend enough to go back a second time."
0,"No thanks.  I ate it without any biological consequences but I think that was just luck, because the tuna was gross.  I eat sushi all the time and prefer anything with tuna in it, so I am very particular about the freshness and this place just doesnt cut it.  Reminded me of picking up a California roll from a convenience store cooler...edible but far better choices are available, all nearby."
0,"I would rate them a zero but thats not an option here so let me go ahead and rant. I booked a stay through Orbitz for one night Dec. , then a few days later wanted to extend the stay and used hoteltonight for Dec. . nnUpon checkin, pm I asked the supervisor, Gural Sihng, sp? if it would be possible to keep the same room for both nights and he said, No, its a totally different room. I then asked if we could stay on the same floor at least and he replied curtly, No. He handed me the room keys and stared at me like he was Ebenezer Scrooge and I was begging him for spare change.nnI asked him when I should checkout and checkin for the next day and he said, You have to leave by noon but your next room wont be ready until pm. Then, the why are you making me do my job stare comes back on his face by which point I was too tired to argue and left for my room. nnWhen I reached the elevator only one of the two key cards worked! I came back down stairs and waited  to get a replacement key card because the  attendant at the desk was busy and the supervisor was nowhere to be found.nnThe rooms are old and dingy. The carpet smells moldy and the couch gave me an awful rash. The beds arent bad but the room is tightly packed with too much furniture like a garage sale of mismatched items. The room was nonsmoking and yet, the smell of cigarettes from the early s still haunt it. nnThe next day, I checked in at pm, well after the time the room was supposed to be ready and the attendant asked me to wait another half hour because the room isnt clean yet. I walked around the lobby searching for a place to sit down and ended up waiting in the bathroom because slot machines are for those who are playing and I wasnt about to grab a drink in the middle of the afternoon no matter where I am. nnHalf an hour past, and I came back to the desk extremely irate. I asked if there were any accommodations they could offer for my ordeal and here comes my favorite supervisor again. I told him that he had been rude to me the night before and that I had to wait well past my check in time promised both on the confirmation email and straight from his mouth and he responded, I was rude to you? How was I rude? Its a busy time of season and everyone has to wait. nnI told him about the attitude he presented the night before and the lateness of the room again and he quickly responds, We can give you a fun book, it has  free play and coupons, and began to fill out my name on the voucher. He finishes writing throws it into my room key holder and for the third time throws me that I wish I could freeload off my parents so I could stay in their basement and not work to earn my keep look. nnI decided then and there, NEVER to stay here again. I cant imagine the type of training involved for this person to have reached supervisor position but Im sure it was lacking in every sense of the words customer service. He was rude, careless, and didnt seem to value the fact that my bookings were paying his wage. I will not only choose other hotels for all future Vegas visits but I will make sure to convince any and all willing to listen to never stay here either. I will be like the tobacco lobbyists on Capitol Hill advocating avoidance of the El Cortez.nnNot even if they offered me complimentary stays and a manservant to carry out my every whim for the rest of my days would I ever want to gaze upon the visage of that socalled supervisor again."
0,"I recently had a couples message after buying a Groupon for the Oasis Day Spa. While I really enjoyed my massage immensely, it had everything to do with the massage therapist and nothing to do with the Oasis. The massage therapist offered me a  discount on my next massage so I was excited to call a few days later to book my next massage. When I called, I had been informed the therapist I had had was let go. No further information given. When I asked about the  discount I was told I could no longer use the discount since that specific therapist no longer works there. Poor customer service in my opinion. If you want to keep a customer, you extend the  discount to any other therapist. So, I wont be going back."
0,"Another Vegas place I need to knock stars off for.. sad. We had another one of those  giftcards to burn, so decided to give them another shot. Fiance ordered wild board stew pasta.. it was just OK.. pasta was too al dente and didnt have a very good flavor to it.. sauce was just alright. I ordered the Gnocchi.. gross! I adore gnocchi and order it frequently, but this was the worst gnocchi Ive ever had. I kid you not, chef boyardee crap tasted better than this gnocchi did. Seriously disappointed! Drinks are still pretty good and no complaints on service... Ill stick to drinks in the bar next time and mb try the pizza."
0,"Located in the Overstreet Mall, next to McDonalds. I decided to give them a try and ordered the Club, turkey, ham, roast beef, bacon  Swiss, with whatever additions, lettuce, tomato, etc. the line was long so I thought that is good sign.

0,"What a Waste !! This pricey Italian restaurant at the Red Rock had Salad Dressing with more salt than anywhere I have been. The bread rolls were cold. Service was very very slow. Someone at the table ordered Risotto with no dairy. The waiter brought it out and said it has no butter at all. He forgot to mention it had a ton of cheese in it. We sent it back and assumed they would not put it on our  plus bill. We did not say anything but......  Also the pizza was overcooked, so if you are staying at the Red Rock save money and try the Yard House, they also have pizza and pasta and many other choices and they are all very good!"
0,"SO to any vegetariansvegans reading this WARNING, this is where the very concept of vegetarianismveganism goes to die. nnAt Goodfellas, the Korean ahjoomah simply gives you that standard, condescending uggggh glare and reluctantly brings out a meatless dish that they probably spat in.

0,"I prefer staying at a Marriot simply because I use my rewards points. It does not get me much, but I do know that the beds and rooms are really clean and comfortable.nnA recent trip to Arizona found me at the Fairfield Inn...Granted not all Fairfield Inns are equal in size.nnI looked this one up on the Marriot Website called the  number and was told the rooms were full. So I made a reservation online and got in just fine..nnMY COMPLAINT on this two star is the fact that on line it said the room had a space for a roll away bed which I needed for my  year old. Well once we got into the room, there was NO WAY a roll out would fit. It would have blocked the entry and the bathroom. So please MARRIOT do not advertise room for a rollaway when clearly there isnt one. Even the lady at the desk knew it. No larger rooms to be had either. nnSo be weary travelers with kids....Im sure it was a safety issue putting one in the door way. The fire department would have issues im sure.nnnNeedless to say, I moved another hotel"
0,"After reading the good and not so good reviews of this restaurant, my husband and I decided to give it a try  We went on a Friday night without reservations. To start off with when we entered your eyes really have to adjust to the very dark dinning room.  There was a couple in front of us with reservations and when we heard the host telling them in not such a friendly manner that they were early we knew this wasnt going to be good...lol.  We were told that the  only seating available was in the bar.  The waitress promptly escorted us to this area that was an enclosed cement floor like patio area.  The table we were offered was this tiny high top that would almost fit two people not very comfortably.  We looked at the rest of the room and there were a BUNCH of table clothed tables empty.  We asked if we could sit at one of those and she just said No.  We werent even offered a wait time in which we could have been sat in the dinning room or barpatio tables. The main dinning room wasnt even full.  My husband and I decided to leave and the hostess showed us a back door out.  Not even a little apologetic.  So we ended up dinning at a wonderful restaurant downtown.  So my rating is not on the food but on how they treat their diners.  We wont even give them a second chance.  Not all the reviews have  been great for their food and the prices are pretty steep for a place that looks horrible on the outside and cold on the inside.  O, there is a  coupon on their website.  That will cover cheese and bacon on two baked potatoes."
0,"Escape gets a B for effort but a D for execution.  I understand that the move to the bizarre new location was one of necessity and not choice, but that doesnt make drinking coffee, studying or knitting there any more appealing or comfortable.  nnI dont consider myself any kind of connoisseur, but I agree with another reviewer that the coffee tastes sort of bitter and strange.  Ive also had friends complain about the temperature of the coffee that is, it isnt hot enough.  They no longer offer the delicious pastries from Stellas bakery, although I admit that the Copps storebrand treats they now have seem slightly fresher than the Stellas did.  At least they seem to be serving tea again  iced tea, anyway.  I have a friend who swore shed never go back after the owner told her they would no longer be serving tea and were focusing on coffee only this was months ago.  They seem to be constantly running out of stuff  there was no Splenda or whipped cream the last time I was there.nnThe space and atmosphere are the true problems with the place.  The new location is, as I said, very weird and uncomfortable.  While the old location was definitely weird, at least it was comfy and homey with soft chairs and tables that didnt look like they were about to collapse.  Not as much can be said for the new, smaller location.  Its like drinking coffee in an abandoned warehouse.  The floors are hard and cold.  The tables and chairs are beyond rickety.  Theres apparently no air conditioning as the doors are kept constantly open, which means there are literally a dozen flies buzzing around you at any given time.  And they require you to buy something if you want to access the slow internet  for two hours at a time.nnThe constantly blaring jazz music is insufferable.  INSUFFERABLE.nnThe space where you order your drinksfood is a mess.  It all seems really dirty and utterly disorganized.  The last two times I was there, the credit card machine wasnt working.  The first time I ended up paying with a check the second, I just didnt order I was there with a knitting group.  And speaking of dirty, the carpets in the main room are really disgusting.  Are they ever vacuumed?nnSome positives to consider the staff is undoubtedly friendly and accommodating to the point that they can be given the limitations of the space and the recent move.  There is outdoor seating.  They offer a variety of weekly activities movie night, open mic.  They have been kind enough to accommodate our rather rowdy knitting group during their transitional period.nnI have continued to go back to Escape despite the annoying music, the crappy service and the strange rules, but at this point I am just about done.  I do still have a knitting group that meets there weekly, but how am I supposed to even buy a drink if the credit card machine isnt working?!"
0,"Eh. Not good. nThe only reason we chose Seablue was bc we were stupid and didnt make any dinner reservations in Vegas. Oh well... we figured it would be great recommended by an MGM concierge, who, go figure, recommended mostly restaurants in his own establishment  we should have known.nnThe only good thing about this dinner was the free pita or whatever bread and dipping sauces that came with the meal which yes, was AMAZING!!. After looking over the menu and being completely unimpressed, I went with the Caesar salad again, eh  Ive had it better a hundred times. My husband got the Artic Char  my usual fave  but it was fishy tasting and overcooked. The sides were random and pretty much the same for most dishes.nnThe lobster corndogs are probably big sellers  who wouldnt want to try it, right? We fell into the trap and got a trio sampler. The corndog was a little strange tasting. My recommendation besides to not order them would be  if you do  dont deconstruct them. The meat alone is pretty nasty looking AND tasting.nnService was okay. I wouldnt go back or recommend though."
0,"What can I say but Meh.n nA friend and I shared the special omelet of the day which had jalapenos, corn, black beans, avocado, green chile, bacon and cheese in it.  It was huge and more than enough to share.  But it wasnt particularly tasty.  The bacon was overcooked and greasy, and I actually like my bacon very well done!  The jalapenos either werent in it or had no taste and the green chile was bland. That baby should have had a huge scoop of fresh pico de gallo to accompany it to give it some flavor! The breakfast potatoes were almost burnt and tasted like they had been cooked in old grease that remained behind to coat them!  The wheat toast was actually a soft long wheat roll, cut in half and toasted  not tasty at all and I dont want soft toast!  The coffee was good and the service was attentive.  Based on the quality of that meal, I wouldnt go back .. Id eat next door at Liberty Market instead!"
0,"I didnt know shtty wok from south park existed but this is it. Come here and enjoy theyre incredibly low quality food with their incredibly high quality decor. nnWe got the calamari and pad thai.

0,Its a shame that a company just earning its name back from being associated with a huge tire scandal that was responsible for countless injuries and deaths now stoops to conning customers into unneeded new tires and up charges.

Had to wait another ten minutes while I waited for them to heat the coal on a burner, rather than other places that get it smoking for you and have coals ready out back. I go to lounges for the service, if I wanted to take care of it myself I would just smoke at home. Will not be back."

NO WHERE. The dish came and had four shrimps and on the shrimp were ginger and a slice of pepper. Knowing that I cant eat spicy food, I took OFF the ginger and the pepper.  But sure enough, it was spicy. So spicy that I had to spit out the food! The waiter came back to ask us how we were doing and I said that I didnt like the appetizer and it was too spicy.

0,"One thing my wife and I try to avoid on date night are big corporate chain restaurants once I heard that Larry and Guy sold the amazing Eddie Vs brand to Red Lobster I swore Id never go back.  However, we had just finished a movie and decided to give it a shot and order what used to be my favorite appetizer of all time, the Kung Pao Calamari.  When it arrived, my dislike of big coporate chains was reinforced with a bland dish that I had no desire to finish.  My wife felt the same way having had the earlier version.nnThe KPC is not what it used to be when John Carver was the chef before Red Lobster bought them out.  I admit Im living in the past about this dish but it used to be my favorite item Ive ever had in any restaurant, no kidding!  Back then it was not the rings but a calamari steak, cut into strips and the sauce was much spicier.  I think the strips may have been sauteed instead of fried but its been too long to recall exactly.  I had this dish no less than  times over a few years since I was one of the regular musicians that played there every time it was like I cant believe this is so amazing. That dish had serious flavor but, sadly, it is only a distant memory, like the hot sorority girl I met at a frat party in .  nnTo finish on a positive note our bartender was personable and quick with the wine.  She said the calamari was going to be amazing but, if she had tried the pre Red Lobster version I doubt she would give the same endorsement.  nnI know there are tons of great reviews for Eddie Vs so my review doesnt amount to much in comparison.  I just wish the big corps didnt water down great and unique recipes.  Well stick with the privately owned, local places from now on."
0,"Thinking about airport food in Phoenix...NEVER AGAIN in front of Security!nnNormal patterns have me flying out of Phoenix Friday evening and returning Sunday about noon.  Because of the only constant in life being change, I am now flying outta Phoenix Wednesday morning and back Friday morning.  Since it was  AM, I had no idea what I was going to find once I passed through Security, so I figured I would give Oaxaca a try.nnLike most airport restaurants, it looks clean.  The menu, while varied, did not allow much for an innovative order.  My hispanic food passion of late is a guacamole burrito.  Its guacamole, onion, cheese, sour cream and bacon.  Between the milquetoast anglo morning register guy looks too young and acts too immature to be called a manager who rang up my burrito by item...including the tortilla for the burrito... for a burrito to go was a bit more than I anticipated.  Prices on the regular burritos and other offerings were a bit more reasonable, so I anticipated a pretty large burrito.nnMilquetoast, the register guy, asked if I preferred strips of bacon or if I wanted my bacon crumbled.  I asked for strips.  He then asked if I considered  strips sufficient, or if  sounded better.  I replied that I would take what I could get for the somewhat large charge . I paid for bacon.  Milquetoast then spoke to the grill guy in broken schoolbook Spanish.  The grill guy looked at the receipt and turned to ask me if I wanted eggs or potato in the burrito.  When I replied that I did not, he asked me if this was a breakfast burrito or a lunch burrito.  Looking at my watch and seeing it was still before  AM, I replied that it would be a breakfast burrito unless it was cheaper for me as a lunch burrito.  nnThe grill guy turned and scooped crumbled bacon onto the grill, added onion and slapped down a tortilla.  Everything heated and he assembled the burrito.  I could not see all of his activities, so when he put a burrito on a plate and called me over, I reminded him this was ordered to go.  He wrapped up the small burrito and handed me burrito and salsa in a bag.  I turned and headed toward Security to get to my gate.  nnOn arriving at my gate, I sat down and prepared to enjoy breakfast.  The burrito was as light as it was small.  While I had requested strips of bacon, the crumbles were well distributed through the burrito.  It is too bad that the guacamole and cheese were not, and there was no sour cream anywhere on the burrito.  nnWhile my typical reaction in such a situation is to return to the restaurant, there just was not time to go back in front of security to display the incorrect order.  nnIf there is a next time, I just need to stick to the regular menu."

It was a little off the strip so i was a little concerned but Ive heard good things about the Marriott so I decided to trust it. we stayed in a room with a sliding glass door that led to the parking lot.

We had over a  worth of stuff stolen, including phones, ipods, designer sunglasses, etc. we called the front desk, they sent a security gaurd who preceeded to tell us that he saw our sliding glass door was open and told the front because that seemed odd but i guess she didnt do anything. I asked for security cameras and he said they only had one at the front entrance. I asked what we could do and he said we could file a police report. i said ok should i come with you he said no its fine theyll take care of it at the front. nothing happened. we called the front and they told us to call the cops ourselves. wen we called to talk to the manager in the morning to ask if there was anything she could do to help because no one came to speak to us thereafter, she said it wasnt their fault and offered us  percent off.

I immediately called them and the manager said shed send out another order and refund my money... The food never came.  Today I called her and she changed her story saying she never said shed send out another order... So I guess in her mind a free meal with bugs is a good way to take care of their customers.

While Im not saying this was in anyway bad, it made buttering and jamming a wee bit awkward...maybe it was because I wasnt wearing my scone shoes the owners had perhaps noticed this!nnQuestioning whilst paying for lunch the young lad at the till, he seemed to either be unaware that its difficult to grab an already soft scone on a flat plate but near impossible a get it to your face in one piece from ceramic with a slight curvature.nnMaybe he was having a giraffe, or worse had some mysterious force been at play the day before and smashed all the plates leaving them not time to replace any?nnWith not much of a response other than oh you didnt like it on that, I cant wait to go again to see what idiosyncrasies they might use in serving a pizza or pasta? Others were eating there but it was not busy, distinctly quiet apart from the tv on. nnHowever a nice toasted warm scone with cappuccino  and if your not in for working lunch then a massive plasma on the far wall at the weekend shows sport, not sure if they serve beers also though? nnIn all food and coffee ok, served quick and was warm! What do you think? Is this place a hit or a miss?"
0,"This Lowes is like a gathering of useless people. I try to avoid it, but its closer to my house than Home Depot. Regardless, its worth the extra  min drive to Home Depot.nWent into this Lowes yesterday looking for a handheld remote for a fan. Im an electrician by trade and really prefer the Harbor Breeze remotes. Like usual, there was one person working the electrical department surrounded by a herd of DIYers. Its ridiculous.nUsually I wait, but there were so many people trying to ask questions. I decided to ask another employee if he could call someone else from the electrical section. This old guy was working in the tile flooring section and rudely asked me if I can see the item in his section indicating that it wasnt his problem. nIm sorry that your life has amounted to nothing more than minimum wage selling flooring, but thats no excuse to treat people like crap. They should shut this place down and open another Home Depot. It would be doing everyone a favor."
0,"My wife and I decided to try out the Gordon Ramsay Pub and Grill since we are local fans of his.  We were very pleased with Burgr at the Planet Hollywood and figured we would be equally pleased here.  Overall we really wanted to like the place but were disappointed and will not return, especially after the surreal experience towards the end of our stay.nnWe didnt have to wait to long to get in  minutes and my wife won some decent coin on the slots beforehand.  Our server was not very knowledgeable about the beer selection or other items on the menu as we were about to find out.  My wife wanted to get a beer comparable to Stella Artois something we could justify spending  on but the server could not help us identify a similar beer since we were unfamiliar with some of the brands and figured he was.  We ended up ordering sodas and water instead.  Probably a wise choice considering the cost.nnI ordered the bangers and mash and my wife ordered the onion soup and the mac and cheese.  I enjoyed the sausage links made inhouse but felt the potatoes were a bit overdone with cream and butter.  My wife liked the onion soup but felt that there was only one tiny slice of french bread on the top and not the normal amount of bread usually served with this soup.  The taste of the mac and cheese was pretty good yet the noodles were very underdone.  They were about  minutes away from being al dente.  When my wife brought this up to our server she has professional kitchen and culinary training, he said yes, the noodles are supposed to be al dente, and that was it.  It was a weird exchange.  It was too bad the noodles were too gummy because the rest of it was pretty tasty.nnI had never had rhubarb before, so my wife ordered the rhubarb cobbler from the menu.  After about  minutes, our server came to us and said the item had been d from the menu but they were making some more downstairs.  My wife a former employee of CaesarsHarrahs asked about the other desserts and found that they come from the downstairs bakery that provides pastries for other eateries in the casino.  We were very disappointed with this news.  The desserts might be Ramsays recipes or they might not be it wasnt clear to us, but the fact that they were being massproduced in the downstairs bakery rather than inhouse upset us a little.  Nothing against the people who work in the bakery at Caesars they make some delicious pastry, but for a fine dining experience you would expect to get your dessert made in house at the prices being charged.  After  more minutes they delivered the cobbler, yet the cobbler they delivered was a peach cobbler.  She again notified our server, and this is where it got bizarre.  He argued that it was indeed rhubarb a different kind of rhubarb at that mixed with other fruits.  My wife was flabbergasted, as was I.  She knows the difference between a rhubarb and a peach and was offended that our server tried to convince us otherwise.  I have no experience with rhubarb myself, yet I know it is reddishpurple because I see it at the store.  I also know what a peach looks like, and it looked and tasted exactly like the fruit that was in the cobbler.  There wasnt a shred of red or purple anywhere in that cobbler, just straight up yellow.  After we left, I looked up a picture of rhubarb cobbler and it was bright red and purple.  We sent the cobbler back and they did not charge us for it.  Afterwards the manager came to us and apologized for the mixup, yet still carried the viewpoint that it was a different kind of rhubarb.  I mean, enough already.  It was peach.  End of story.  nnLong story short we wanted to like the place, but were disappointed and slightly offended that they kind of thought we were dumdums in the great rhubarbpeach debate.  Good thing Gordon Ramsay has a good burger place in town to fall back on."
0,"Went here for the lunch buffet, which was only available for a short duration during summer I believe.nnIt was not too expensive however there is not much to choose from, only four types of pizza were provided along with a salad bar. The salad bar was very small and only had one dressing, and the only vegetable was Roman lettuce.nnThe pizza tasted alright, albeit it boggles me that they put hotdog sausages in their crust, which were very dry and tasteless.nnTheir ice cream machine didnt work"
0,"I know its been almost two weeks since Nascar was at PIR but I needed some time to let this experience marinade with me. My friend had called and asked if I wanted to go to thisjoyus event and I thought about it for a minute and asked myself how bad could it really be? nnWell besides the bomb ass tickets we got from my friends boss I was completely taken back by the whole freakin secret society that attend this event... It was insane to say the least. I would have to recommend buying the headphones with the little tv  so you can tune into any driver and hear what is really going on in the race because you cant hear crap coming out of the speakers. nnNow, I would have to compare Nascar to hockey, the only good thing about a hockey game is a good fight. Same with Nascar, race is pretty boring without the crashes. Now Im not going out to this event in the hopes that someone is going to get seriously injured so it was nice to see some cars get smashed up without injury. nnNow my biggest complaint, if you plan on going to an event with AT LEAST , people, please dont get bent out of shape if someones jacket rubs your arm. So to the lady that lost it at the hot dog stand because my jacket touch your arm, you should have accepted the water I was offering you and NOT CONTINUED DRINKING. Also, if you plan on rolling your eyes at someone and talking shit dont start crying when they confront you and run to your husband like he is going to help you out of the situation your drunk ass got yourself in. nnAll in all it was a good experience but probably not something I would ever go to again."
0,"I have been here  times. Both very disappointing. The first time I went to Su Wu was no long after they opened. Went there for dinner. Fries are really good, the rest of the food in the menu is TERRIBLE. I ordered tacos and I couldnt even eat them because they were disgusting. nnThis weekend I went here again because I wanted to give it another try, since maybe the lunch menu would be better. I sat there for  minutes and they didnt even bring us the menu. NOTHING. I looked at the waitress a couple times. She looked back at me. But she was too busy talking with some friends on another table. Not coming back here ever again."
0,I was not impressed with this place. Host seemed inexperienced. Water and tea has a musty taste. Salsa was too chunky. Waited a long time for check. I had a taco salad with beef asada. The beef had good flavor. The staff was friendly.
0,"This place was not quite the ending lunch I wanted to grab before leaving Vegas.nnFood Banh mi  Taste is decent but way too little filling. Not enough herbs and the do chua is cut too big. And they put peas in it. Who puts peas in banh mi ? ! nCoffee  cafe sua da. I wonder if they think Im so blind that I wouldnt see that  of the cup was ice. The taste was good but really a ripoff for what you get.nnService Good nice people... who skimps on food unfortunately.nnSetting clean big nice place... that skimps on foodnnSo yea, please avoid this place if you dont want to start hating Vietnamese banh mi."
0,"Well...the least I can say is that I was expecting great pizza from this place. Ive looked at the pictures and thought wow, that looks good! But it wasnt. Maybe I got the wrong pizza. The crustdough kind of tasted like cardboard to me. It wasnt crisp or chewy. I had a personal, half spinach and I added shrimp. The shrimp were hard as rocks. My pizza was warm and I think my guests pizzas were just warm as well. There were only two other people dining in the whole restaurant while we were there. Our pizzas should have been smoking hot! Im disappointed in this pizza experience. I may need to go back on another day. Definitely not my goto pizza spot."
0,Just ordered food from here this evening for delivery. I have NO idea how this place gets   stars on here.  It was the worst chinese food I have ever eaten.  We ordered sesame chix which was soggy and gross. The eggrolls were overpriced and are more like a spring roll. the lomein is okay but will never get food from here again.
0,"Saw a long line at this place and assumed that it would be good. However, we were tricked since those people in line are business people here for conference and they were just grabbing quick lunch.nnIts Vegas price, not Vegas quality. I got Chicken Cesar salad, the meat was very plain, and they forgot to give me dressing.nnThere is a Starbucks next to the corner  even Starbucks would have been a much better choice."
0,"Had to write this review.nI had been to Pho Avina quite few times and thought it was good not great in comparison to a few other places in the area.  nThe convenience in location brought us back, even though it seemed like their portions were getting smaller and smaller.nnToday we ordered a takeout and I found a a cut fingernail in my noodle soup.  I cant tell if its a finger or a toenail, but it still makes me sick thinking that I ate some of it.nnIts too bad because the mom here seems like such a nice sweet person, but somewhere along the line, whether its the cook or someone by the takeout boxes, someone is cutting their nails where they shouldnt.nnI obviously will no longer go there and suggest no one go there either."
0,"The other reviews are exactly right about this place.  The food is pretty good but not great and you definitely get the feeling that you are paying for the location Scottsdale Quarter, which is really not a plus anyway.  Burgers are about  but nowhere near as good as those at the Yard House.  Cocktails are fine, but at  you expect more than a straightforward Mr. Bostons drink.  They supposedly use local ingredients in some dishes, but the tomatoes in the tomato salad where very underwhelming  the mozzarella in the same salad was pretty good, however. I didnt feel like I got ripped off, but I do not think I would go back to pay extra for the average food, especially given the annoyingly high Scottsdale douche factor at the Scottsdale Quarter."
0,"We got ripped offfff!!!!!  nMy boyfriend and I were visiting Montreal last week before our bus back to NYC  sunday June rd around pmish, we went for Da Giovanni around  the bus station.  There were bout  tables, waitress was busy but she seemed friendlyshort in stature mid age, with short red hair.  It tool a while but she finally got to us.  We had some trouble communicating but got our two orders in.  We got the drinks and then  minutes our foodvery fast.  Then she came back with the bread.  I liked the food, the manicotti was cooked al dente, and the sauce was finenot the best but good.nThe problem came when I went to pay with my credit card.  I stood up to pay at her station because we were a bit late to catch our bus, I was curious about the breakdown because of the two taxes and I wanted to understand how it worked so I asked her, but she couldnt understand me.  And then she proceeded to tell me about service tip that I should give her.  I said to her  Dont worry about it I live in the USA and is customary to tip  besides Ive worked in the industry for very long.  but soon she pulled out a calculator and wrote her own tip in the receipt that I am supposed to fill in and sign.  She tipped her self .  and then had me signed it.  I was very  exhausted and over it and decided not to make a scene and leave like that.  nnIf you go, make sure to bring canadian to pay in cash.  That goes better for most bars and cheap restaurants in Montreal."

0,"Not only did a drink from this location give one of my coworkers diarrhea for  hours straight, but they always make the drinks wrong and act like you are asking them for their first born when you ask them to remake it. nnFor  my drink better be right damnit!nnGo to the location inside the Safeway at th StreetElliot instead unless you want your ass glued to the toilet seat all afternoon."
0,"This store is a big fail when compared to other Circle Ks...... Its very ghetto need to say more... Theres frequent cops and ambulances there!!! I live down the street and avoid as much as possible.  The wine and spirits are limited, but they have hard liquor so its a plus hence the one star!!!..... The location is fairly convenient and the clerks are very polite and professional."
0,". They dont give you complimentary glasses of water. I paid  for a SMALL bottle of Fiji water bottle. SMALL. mL. completely flabbergasted.nn. Security there is irritating and stupid. My date and i seriously went back and forth looking for the mens restroom just because about  different security guards led us the wrong way. Another reason? We were front row for Boys Noize and they needed the crowd to back up because of a performance. Instead of just asking us, SINCE WE WERE JUST STANDING THERE, they pushed us back. AND kept pushing us back...because of that, one of the stupid guards hurt mine and my friends feet we were in heels so we decided to take a break and take them off.... then we were TOLD we needed them on. WTF. stupid. nn. Drinks?  for a redbull  vodka. yupp.nn. Theres absolutely no control on their lines to get in. They had about  different lines. Luckily, I got a free drink ticket yet that did not make up for the  mins we had to wait in line....nn. Most of the crowd was weird. Like I mentioned before, we went to see Boys Noize. There was only about  people around us that KNEW who he was.... not fun. nn. Be prepared for a swarm of guys once your date leaves. Who are you waiting for? My boyfriend... Oh, really? You lyin? No, you want to go meet him? Hes in the bathroom. Nasty man walks away"
0,Had detail done  hrs and still not good. Had to come back and spend another  hrs to get it good enough. Always busy Friday thru Sunday. Dont leave anything you want to keep in your Veh! They cleared out my change holder. Extra . tip I guess
0,GROUPON USERS BEWARE........So we used the Groupon for a two night stay in a courtyard room w  free play and buffet included. What they forgot to mention is that their is a . resort fee for every day that you stay to pay for things you cannot get.....INTERNET...NOPE . a night. The room we stayed in was atrocious and the shower would not fit an average sized adult and our toilet kept on clogging. It felt like we were staying inside a cardboard box because I swear the walls were paper thin...we awoke time and time again from people or housekeeping meandering about in the hallways or trucks driving in and out of the delivery bay....which we were right next to. We take our  in free play and go hit the tables. I play roulette.....I win....The man takes my  chip and gives me ? I was like WTF arent I supposed to win ? he spoke broken English so I couldnt really understand him but when I complained they informed me that the chips they give you are STARTER chips just to get you going which is why when I won I was only given  instead of ...yeah that makes sense.....We did not get a chance to eat at the buffet due to incredibly long lines which btw you have a  hr time frame to eat else your free credit is worthless and their insistence that we charge everything to the room. This place made me feel like a vagrant that needed to be put up in a hostel for the night. I just pray that I didnt get any bedbugs after reading some other reviews. Enjoy your Groupon and the craziness that comes with it.
0,"What good is  Hour Fitness Free Day Pass when they wont honor it...  Hr Fitness is nationwide, being a local or not should not make a difference when the rates are the same and there are locations available near the following persons address?nnnnI work out here often, the staff are friendly, the facilities are adequate, however I had a friend come as a guest.  She called in advance to see if she would be eligible under my guest pass, which I did not have on hand, the person on the phone said shouldnt be a problem, they would take care of her.  nnWhen we got there, the manager, name starting with V not sure if I can mention peoples names on here, said that she couldnt work out under my guest pass because she was not local, she explained to him that the person on the phone said it was fine  he told her that she was lying because there was no record of the phone call on their hand written phone log.  She asked him if he would make an exception since we had made a long trip to the gym  we were told that it would be ok  she also told him how she too was a personal trainer for Ballys.. He started to get very snarky  condescending  told her there was a reason why Ballys was down the hole.   So I stepped in to tell him that there was no need for him to be rude  that his attitude was poor and condescending.  I asked him if there was a day fee we could just pay so we could go work out together, he told me the price in which case I handed him the cash which he took.  My friend asked for the paperwork she filled out back because she didnt feel that they needed her personal info since they would not allow her to use my guest pass,  he wouldnt give it back, so she grabbed it herself.  He told her he was going to call the cops  she couldnt work out.  And he reluctantly gave back my money.  nnHe should not be a manager if he cant be nice  professional, instead he was rude  defensive  out right unacceptable behavior.  Even his staff member apologized to us when he walked off."
0,"They are good for drinks, but other than that they dont care about you, even bottle service and talking to a manager they overcharge, after they over charge you they add to the price of every drink you order and want a tip, if you ask for the management to correct the BS you get a free shot that in no way makes up for the neglect you get when you get bottle service. Dont go here for a party and after I bought bottle service, the BUS BOY spilt beer in my girlfriend and I, overall a horrible night."
0,"I had greater hopes for Little Szechuan over the nearby Mr. Hunan as the latter is simply a carry out joint. However, despite the nice colorful dining room, the food at Little Szechuan was fairly bland. I suppose theoretically these two Chinese joints specialize in the regional cuisine of their names, but there is little difference in menu or taste. nnOne thing I will say is that my waitress was extraordinarily nice at Little Szechuan. I was studying Arabic at the time and we had a really friendly, fun conversation about language. She helped make an incredibly dull meal an actually rewarding experience."
0,"The lady on the phone was rude when I called in and seemed like I was bothering her from her oh so busy evening at work. I ordered food for delivery and they told me about  to  minutes... Then the idiot driver kept trying to ring the doorbell.. He didnt bother knocking but called me  times... Umm hello? Ever hear of knocking??? When he finally knocked I got the door and then he tried to ring the doorbell again. RUDE!!!! I have a baby so I disconnected the doorbell.. I dont need idiots ringing the doorbell and waking her up. nnThe food was horrible. I ordered the sesame chicken with pork fried rice,  vegetable rolls, the pork filled wontons, and pineapple chicken. The entrees were really, and I mean REALLY bland... The rice was absolutely disgusting... At least the appetizers were decent. I asked if they had regular wontons, without the crab and they told me no... Do they not make it fresh????? For me, being Caucasian, I make WAY better Chinese food than this supposed authentic restaurant... Will NEVER be going there again."
0,"Where to start...nnLocation is awkward end of a mostly deserted hallway and was certainly of no help to former occupant FIRST Food and Bar.nnAmbiance inside the restaurant itself is quite nice, although tables thrown in the hallway seem strange.  Outdoor seating is laughable and illconceived.  Its essentially at the top of an escalator leading up from Walgreensdown to the Strip so plenty of foot traffic will get to checkout your food.  The outdoor view is obstructed by a wall.  This area was never intended for restaurant seating and has emerged as a hot spot for Grand Canal Shoppes employees to congregate and smoke.  Enjoy!nnService is slow and uninterested, perhaps even worse than FIRST.  Maybe the same staff?  A friend of mine said he and his date waited  minutes at an empty bar to be acknowledged, let alone served.  He was so aggravated they left without eating.  Hes a bartender in the Venetian and understands the importance of timely service.  My experience wasnt much better.nnMy food was bland, were talking CPK bland.  A penne dish was swimming in flavorless oil and assorted vegetables that looked to be leftover from some other dish and the chicken parm was just as bland.  Skipped dessert which was probably my mistake given thats the namesakes claim to fame.  Speaking of, who thought naming an Italian restaurant after a wellknown PASTRY chef was a good idea?nnIve already spent too much energy on this place.  Maybe it will improve and it seems others have had better experiences, but I wont give it a second go."
0,"Totally concur with other reviews.  TERRIBLE.  Refrigerator broke in a rental property on a Friday.  They didnt respond until Tuesday.  Didnt order parts until Wednesday.  Then, after getting the parts the following MONDAY, they didnt get back to install the parts until FRIDAY.  I had no choice but to deal with them as they were hired by my home warranty. So, it took  weeks to get a very common Sears Kenmore refrigerator fixed.  They could care less about fixing your stuff."
0,"We originally decided to go here based on Yelp reviews and wanting to try a new restaurant during Queens Feast.  nnI made reservation for pm because it was the closest time to pm that was available.  Fine enough, must mean it is worth the wait...  Not so much.  We waited over  minutes for a table.  They did bring out a few appetizers to sample for the crowd that was waiting, so nice effort, but it was extremely salty and not very tasty.  nnUpon seating, we decided to order off the menu which our waitress told us was rare for the night  everyone wanted the  prix fixe.  It started out decent enough.  Tomatomozzerella salads are hard to get wrong.  The crab cake was unlike our midAtlantic palets were used to, but we liked it.  Until we found a hair in it.  Ooops.  The server apologized, the manager apologized, the food was comped.  All is well.nnOur dinner was average.  My boyfriends steak was good  oz filet, but Ive had some pretty amazing scallops in my life and these didnt even crack the top  Whole Foods serves better scallops.  Definitely not worth .  nnDesert was a strawberry cheesecake concoction.  Decent, but nothing I cant find anywhere else.nnOverall, the service was okay, the food was average, but it definitely wasnt worth the wait, the price, or the overall experience.nnCrowd is somewhat trendy...we wore jeans with nice tops, but I would probably suggest casual pants for the male contigency."
0,The place is really nice has good atmosphere. Although some of the waitresses could use some touch ups. She was not very helpful and our food came  min later cold! The general manager was very nice very helpful
0,"Aria should pay attention to who they hire to represent their company. Its a big turn off.nnBritney, the receptionist at the front desk, was one of the most aloof and careless hotel receptionist Ive encountered. Her greeting was dry, she lacked effort when we asked her questions, and she jotted down the wrong room number. I was hoping to be impressed by this place as I were with all the other city center hotels but the service at Aria really disappointed me. It makes me think Aria treats their employees like crap because no one seems happy there."
0,To those they helped...im glad for you. But you shouldnt say you are available  days when you arent. We needed someone at am yesterday when our very large dog was suffering  we couldnt move him. We called  got a recording that they werent doing  hr service right now. Theres only  places in town that claim they are hr at home care....well the other place isnt either.
0,"It actually pains me to give this place only two stars, but my experience was very lackluster during my recent visit.nnServicenWe had a large group that they werent expecting.  Ok, we get that.  However, my friend tried for a week leading to our gathering to contact the Beer Market to ask about accommodating a group and reserving tables.  No answer, no message, no online web form, basically  no way to contact them.  So we went early to grab some tables.  The wait staff said, no problem, glad to have you.  But they two girls who were sisters quickly mixed up orders, didnt bring drinks out, went missing for extending periods of time only to come back from an obvious smoke break, and were unreliable.  Our group could really only succeed in getting a drink by going up to the bar and ordering one on their own.nnAvailabilitynSo there is about a  page menu of glorious beers at the Beer Market.  Almost any thing you can think of they have it ON THE MENU.  Yes, on the menu, but not in reality.  I kid you not that my friend went through FIVE DIFFERENT OPTIONS before they actually had one in stock that she wanted.  If you dont have it available, take it off the menu.  One or two, ok, but FIVE in a ROW, I dont think so.  And this happened over and over again as the night went on.nnWill I be back?  Likely because it is a big open place where you can order take out and sit around with your friends and hopefully order a hard to find beer.  Location, next to PNC Park, also makes it a draw.  But I wont be back soon.  I have to wait until I forget a little about the lousy service."
0,"I cant comment on the hotel, itself, but heres what I discovered about the point of view of the customer service representatives who work there nnWhen I phoned to inform the front desk that my flight into Vegas had been canceled, and to ask if any considerations might be made since I also had a  night stay booked with them next month, Chris informed me that my booking was prepaid which I was aware of, as I had been the one to have paid it, and had a  hour cancellation policy which I was also quite aware of, and that the rate I had received was considerably below the standard room rate. His implication was that the hotel had done me a favor, and how inconsiderate of me to not have even bothered to arrive on schedule. I was shocked, and he obviously wasnt in the mood to discuss it, so I thanked him and hung up.nnWhat I had forgotten to remind Chris was that it was his corporation which had decided my room rate, not me, and all I had done was select his corporations hotel for my stay, amongst dozens of Vegas hotels, and that the cancellation period has certainly not expired for my extended stay next month.nnIm sure I can find a hotel for the same money that wont treat me as if theyre doing me a favor by accepting my money and allowing me to stay in their room. I recommend any selfrespecting traveler to do the same."

Huge meat is placed in front of each of us who had ordered. It was good too....wait...who ordered the baby shoe sized portion of potatoes and shrooms??? Fuck it...we eat.nnMinutes later, were all so stuffed we cant walk. The majority of us at the table are straight up carnivores that destroy buffets But damn. This amount of food, so late at night which is placed atop several pints of beer, shots of liquor and who knows what else, isnt good at a strip joint.nnWe finished eating, pay  for ...yes... for ...so dumb. Then we go and sit in a corner to chill. After a while a girl comes over and sits on my in process oz steak....nnIm sorry, but no...please. Get off.nWhat are you broke?nNo Im FULL. nnThis happened to a couple more of us and we leave. When Steak ruins tits its never a good thing.

0,"The atmosphere was great but the service was not so great. The drink selection was great. The food selection and presentation was great but it was a little overpriced and extremely oily, I was sick the rest of the night after dinner. Cool place to hang with your bros but not so cool as a dining experience."
0,I was super disappointed with my trip here.nI got the filet and scallop lunch which ended up costing about  dollars. The waitress didnt remember my friend wanted shrimp AND chicken... Also didnt remember my other friend wanted steak. Two of us said we didnt want noodles so she didnt give us noodles or veggies...my steak was cooked well done not med rare as I ordered. My scallops were extremely overcooked. I had to go to bathroom and spit it out it was so hard. Not worth the money. There are cheaper options that taste way better ie Toyama
0,"Have tried Enso several times.  Each time, awful service!!!  Beyond the rudest and most inept servers in all my dining experience.  Overall staff is rude.  nnI love paying  for a meal, only to be treated rudely.  Additionally, the bathrooms were the worst I have experienced and I travel to Newark NJ for work people. Literally smelled like vomit, only  stalls for all the women, no toilet paper, so dirty that I literally was nauseated from the smell and this was after paying  for a meal!!!  If you are going to charge that price, clean your bathrooms please!  It was like a dirty skank club after  am...just horrendous!  nnWith the awful service, rude staff and horribly unclean bathrooms, I would highly recommend anyone with class and wanting to enjoy a decent meal, conversation and night out....STAY FAR FAR AWAY from ENSO.  It appears they have forgotten whom the customer is and have become skank club central.   So beyond dirty, I honestly worry if the food is prepped in an area as unclean as the bathroom."

0,Dont bring kids here...this a family restaurant that doesnt want kids.  Staff is disrespectful to kids and families with small kids.  Decent product poor staff and management.  In fact unless you are perfect like the staff dont go here.  Did I mention that being insulted by staff members is encouraged here?
0,"I am going to split my review in several parts. First I would give the hostess when we first arrived no stars. She asked me several times what my name was and if I had a reservation. She finally gave us a table in the front near the door. When we asked for another table she said we could move to a booth in about  minutes. We waited almost an hour for the booth and in that time several other people came in and were given other tables in the restaurant.  nnOnce we got to our booth Brian our waiter was very attentive. I will give Brian five stars for his service for our entire meal. nnThe price of the meal includes sides so a good value for what you get. nnI will gave the Chef one star.  There were four of us and we all ordered steaks. Only one out of the four meals was cooked correctly. One steak was ordered as medium, it was well done. My husbands steak was ordered as medium and it was medium rare. My steak was ordered as medium and I got rare.  I sent it back and when they brought it back it was only medium rare.  I told them to redo the whole meal. When they finally brought the new steak it was cooked perfectly. But everyone else had finished their meal so I just had them box it to eat later.nnWilliam the asst manager only charged us for two meals so at least they tried to make it right. I am not sure I will come again. Perhaps the regular chef was on vacation last night. Vegas offers many restaurants to choose from."

0,"Graceland Wedding Chapel was the perfect venue for our wedding  our experience was indeed one to be remembered for a lifetime....nnSo why Stars  not ?  Because we felt extremely rushed from the moment we were picked up  we didnt have nearly enough time w Elvis.  The last straw came from the absolute EXTORTION they try to charge for photosnnI will say they set expectations that the ceremony would last about  min...however, I thought that meant the actual ceremony part was  min  we would have more time allotted for taking pictures or having our qualityElvis time.....especially after we PAID OVER   and this was BEFORE tips nnSoon as we got there, they were wrapping up a ceremony  were already ready for us  there were  people behind the counter w each person talking to a different person in our party  it was very chaotic....couldnt keep up w all the conversations, except that someone was asking for a credit card.  nnLiterally as the credit card was being placed back in our wallet, were walking down the aisle  the vows are being completed.  There was no opportunity to make sure my dress was appropriately fluffy, or even sitting center, my hair was still in place, if I had lipstick smeared across my face  nothing!nnThen the photographer doesnt even give us a moment to breathe or let anything sink in as hes directing us to hurry up, stand here, stand there, hurry up, hold the flowers, look at each other, hurry up.  Elvis comes over to stand in a few shots then were handed the tipenvelopes  its all over  were like, wait!  What just happened?!nnAnd I can absolutely confirm the entire experience  ceremony  plus  pics  lasted  min bc of the timestamps on our photo package  which began the moment they shut the door to the moment the final pic was taken  we were shown the exit.  Let me repeat  TWELVE MINUTESnnIf Id known the real timetable, Id have purchased  of the cheaper ceremonies  had more Elvis time for less money bc yeah, it was THAT important to mennHeck, it would have been nice to have had even  extra minutes for an opportunity to take a few photos the way we would have liked to take them either w each other or especially w Elvis....after all, this was the whole reason we had chosen Graceland.....and especially after the amount of money we paidnnI certainly appreciated them knowing the routine well enough to know all the best places to stand  the best poses but our limo driver spent more time w us than the professional photographer or Elvis did, if that tells you anythingnnAnd speaking of pictures, as there are no outside cameras allowed, youre held hostage.....packages include a DVD of the ceremony but do NOT include pics.  We received an  credit towards ordering printed photos  but charging . for  printed x copy is ridiculous!  I can get them printed at Walgreens myself for .!!!  And if youd like the jpegs?  Be ready to cough up TEN DOLLARS PER JPEG bc theyve disabled any way to download them yourself....and at more than  pics, were talking over ?  Are you  serious   ?!nnSo have to say we were fans of the overall concept but I think the jury is still out on the experience....because I really cant remember any of it  for the money we paid, there should have been additional chapeltime, more time w Elvis,  digital pics included"
0,"Stopped in for a late lunchbrunch. She had meatloaf, mashed potatoes, gravy and fried okra. I had corned beef hash, hash browns and eggs over easy. nThe meat loaf barely qualified as meat. It had the consistency of mush and absolutely no meat, onion or any flavor except maybe condensed milk??? Odd flavor and texture. The mashed potatoes and gravy had the same odd flavor. As I said the closest flavor may have been canned condensed milk. She didnt finish it and sent it back. The fried okra was ok.nMy hash browns and eggs were fine. Pretty hard to mess up! The corned beef hash looked ok, but the only thing I could taste was onion. I like onion, but it had NO corned beef flavor at all.nI will say that the service was good and the did take the meatloaf off the bill. I may try them again, but .... not sure."
0,This place just doesnt feel very comfortable.  I get a very odd feeling when I am in the restaurant.  It is like eating in a fishbowl.  Everyone seems to have an air of snottiness.  Food is kind of pricey.
0,"I was so disappointed.  We were there for   hours for the Ramsey Experience!  And the food was not that great.  For  per person I expected to be impressed.  The only thing that came quickly were the drinks.  Our experience included a quail egg not bad, somewhat tasty, octopus was supposed to be charred but my friends piece was just burnt scallop risotto  had to send back because not completely cooked and beef Wellington now I know I dont like beef Wellington  missed their chance to impress me and dessert was some sort of toffee thingy plus a couple of other treats.  I pretty much did not care at this point and did not like any of the desserts.  The loud pounding club music could have also contributed to my attitude.  Never again! Dont do it  not worth the price and definitely not worth the wait!"

0,"Bait and switch at a vet office?? What a disappointment.nWe brought our mastiff here due to an ear infection. After a  minute wait after our scheduled appointment, we were brought back to the exam room where a sample was taken. The tech took time to explain the difference in payment packages available. We opted out of the service packages and received a form with a price quote of just under  for the visit. After another long wait, the results of the ear sample were completed and the vet brought  creams out, along with a bill for . When asked about the discrepency we were told the final bill included the cost of the medications. We declined the medications, paid for the office visit and test and were told the bill would have been considerably less if we had purchased one of their prepaid plans. We asked for a copy of the test results which we paid for and were told that they would not give us a copy, if another vet wanted the results they would have to be requested directly. nnAs unfortunate as this visit was, it led us to another vet in the area who was terrific and only charged us  for the visit, exam, and medication for the ear infection. It does pay to shop around, I will be more diligent with checking reviews from now on."
0,"I was going to a wedding in Peoria, AZ and picked this rental place for its close proximity to the hotel. I also learned that rental places at airports are more expensive, so I was trying to avoid snags. They did warn me on the phone that they close at noon on Saturday. I really only needed the car on Friday. When I got to the store, I looked for the drop box. They didnt have one. They also did not open until am. I have used enterprise many times in many cities, and have even just left keys with hotels!  So this was inconvenient. They said it was that they need to check each car as it comes in. When I returned the car, I pointed out the wear and tear on the interior. The passenger seat was stained. The car had k miles on it. High for a rental. When I told Tyler, the manager in training, my concerns, he came up with cars were damaged overnight when we had a drop box ad we had to hold the renters responsible. I said, get cameras. I was then driven the short drive back to my hotel in the car I returned sitting on the dirty passenger seat. He wanted to get rid of me. Fair enough, I wasnt the happiest customer to say the least. But his driving was scary!  Enterprise, please return the drop boxes and allow you customers to leave their car at their hotel whenever reasonable and possible. I also think this was an isolated incident and should not reflect Enterprise as a whole. Namaste"
0,"Mario Batalis empire has perhaps grown too large.  Rest assured, at home in New York City little could be better.  For example, Del Posto has just garnered a coveted  stars from the New York Times, an honor which has not been bestowed on an Italian restaurant in more than two decades.  The problem is once you leave the city and head for the outer reaches of the empire.  In Las Vegas, the showing is not nearly as impressive.  Enoteca San Marco was decidedly good, so I have no idea why it was transformed into another Otto.  More discouraging,  B and B Ristorante is only fair and Carnevino is one of the more lackluster steakhouses I have come across.  At higher prices than in New York, this is just unacceptable.nnDinner began with an amuse bouche of gougere that was comprised of three different cheeses.  Strikingly simple, the presentation was helped considerably being ensconced in a cloth napkin.  This was a promising start.nnI then had the spago with lamb ragu  as well as the bonein NY strip steak  with a supplemental porcini bearnaise sauce .  As I did not order a side with my steak, these two separate courses were brought out together.  The spago was passable but certainly disappointing when compared to what might be found at Batalis other restaurants.  The portion size was fine, but the ragu really failed to resonate in any way.  The dish fell flat and, as such, did not merit the price.  The steak fared little better.  I ordered it medium rare which was really only a guideline.  Most of the steak was prepared medium, though near the bone there was a portion that was rare.  With the bone, there can be unevenness in the cooking, so I was okay with that.  I would just like to have had my steak a little less cooked overall.  My server proudly informed me that the steak itself was dryaged for twice as long as any other steakhouse on the strip ages their steaks.  True, but I wasnt sure if this added much.  The sauce was regrettable though.  I thought it might be served with the steak.  Instead, it was served in a gravy boat on the side.  It looked fairly well rested to the point where it was starting to congeal.  And there were no fresh porcini mushrooms to be found anywhere  a clear disappointment.  nnTo drink, the selection of wines by the glass was a bit narrow.  I opted for a robust Italian red at  per glass that was less than memorable.  In fact, I wondered to myself if even the bottle costed that much.    nnService was a little scattered with a handful of people handling my table of one through the course of the evening.  My main server was fairly young and very enthusiastic.  While I appreciated his earnest zeal, his presentation was a little over the top at times.  Going so far as to shake my hand at the conclusion of the meal, may have been a bit much.  He believes in the restaurant, so I wont fault him too much.nnOverall, I thought every item cost several dollars more than it should, and the quality of the food was inconsistent with what I expect from a Batali restaurant.  It may survive based on the celebrity chef affiliation, but steak connoisseurs will likely be eating elsewhere.  nnnn. stars"

0,"Deeply disappointed. This was a very special occasion and someone who is a part time chef recommended it.  Got there right after sunset on a week night. Completely dead. The whole dinner was rushed. The server, Amy, kept coming back to tell us this that and just talked way too much. We did not come to see her.  The entrees were super fast even before the wine?!  The restaurant itself was beautiful and the private booths would be a real treat but I doubt there will be a next time. The king crab was swimming in sauce and was  with not that much of a portion. The salmon was  undercooked.  We were comparing this to the ocean club...not for long as the ocean club always had great king crab and anything else on the menu."

0,"Do NOT stay at or purchase this property UNLESS you like practically NON STOP rhythmic DJ, booming NOISE which invades every space in the property!  nn We purchased two units at this property in mid s. We were delighted with it for about  years . The past few years it has become increasingly LESS like the property we purchased. The amenities and benefits that were part of the sales pitch and bargain we had, were taken away one by one. Discounts at the resident deli, No More.  Discounts at the Flamingo Hotel, NO MORE.   But, with each change, we adjusted. Were disappointed, but adjusted.  Now, as of this visit, we will NEVER stay here again. There is NO PLACE in this entire property where one can go and be free on the constant noise  POUNDING, boom boom booming noise from the Flamingo Hotels pool and bar.  It goes from  am to  PM at the pool and then from  pm to  or  AM in the bar. I LOVE music. We are hear for a rhythm and blues festival which we have enjoyed for  days at ANOTHER property. But THIS is not music. A shouting DJ accompanies this much of the time. Our entire party of people found themselves becoming agitated .  nnAs a result, The Flamingo pool area which was also used as a selling point for these units is a most unpleasant place and in some cases, you have to PAY to enter the pool area because a fence has been placed around the perimeter.nWe tried to sit outside even at THIS pool, or outside the deli  no way.nnThe accommodations and personnel here are fine, but, those factors sadly fade because just being here is so unpleasant.nnWe are checking out a day earlier just to leave this situation behind us.nnI will attempt to trade into other HGVC properties when I come back to Las Vegas."

0,"Super frustrated with this location. My dad ordered me a dishwasher I live in his rental over two weeks ago. First off he asked them to contact me so I could arrange for someone to be home on the scheduled date. They did not contact me. They emailed him saying installation would take place on Friday . I still had not been contacted by this afternoon so I decide to give them a call. The woman I spoke with looked up his account and says um you didnt pay for installation and it will be delivered on the rd. Are you kidding me right now???? Please tell me why anyone would wait almost a whole MONTH for a dishwasher?? And also, it had been originally scheduled for an installation, NOT just delivery. So of course I then call Home Depot. They tell me they can have someone to my home on Wednesday. Thats less than a week. Thanks Lowes for your terrible communication and customer service, but we will give our money to Home Depot instead."

0,"We had dinner at SW last night.  Had really looked forward to a nice dinner with water show. From a peek at the prices ahead of time, I thought that this was going to be a very special dinner. Turns out, not so much. nnWe both ordered the baby wedge salad which comes with bacon. In my mind, bacon should be crispy and thoroughly cooked. What was served was a VERY thick very undercooked slab of meat. I couldnt eat it, hubby had no problem with it. nnMy fillet steak was charred on the outside as the menu states, I guess that I just expected the char to be less thick and a little moister and more flavorful on the inside.  No salt or pepper on the table. Salt would have helped some.  Hubbys lamb chops were too salty by contrast. nnI guess that the bottom line is that if this  were a more reasonably price restaurant, I could call it average. But for the prices they charge, I just call it a disappointment."
0,"Well all I can say is the chicken wings we ordered were still half frozen when served to us. We told the server, he reaches onto our plate and grabs a wing off of it, then says yea, youre right, let me tell the cook He comes back out and takes another wing off the plate to check if theyre all cold at this point I dont want any of the food on the plate after his hands have been in it. The nachos were very, um, creative? They had canned stewed tomatoes. Stewed tomatoes. Gross.  I asked for a greyhound with kettle one, which was basically ocean spray white grapefruit juice, no kettle one. nnSo in closing, Id say avoid this place. Go next door to Robertos. You have a better chance of getting decent nachos."

I talked to a few people who all agreed they loosened belt buckles and farted the whole way home. So yeah, dont bring dates here! Also... they were showing the fight last night for a  cover charge. Our group was in the restaurant three hours before the event, yet our server felt it was necessary to inform us that if we were still in there past the time the fight started, we would be charged cover.

0,"This complex was awesome until the new owner bought it in October . Because there are no parcel drop boxes and the office no longer holds packages and USPS does not deliver to individual apts, any package is an automatic  mile round trip to the post office during business hours.

The entrance is littered with signs, balloons, and some pretty obnoxious used car lot type advertising a ft red Flappy Man.nnBest of all, we were all just informed we were being offered an early bird special which means we have  hours to renew leases mine isnt up for  months at a reduced rental increase or if we wait past  hours, rent increases significantly.

Also, they are doubling monthly pet rent. nnThe facility is quiet and decent. The pool is nice. The new owner is unpredictable and greedy. Property maintenance has suffered.

I am  months pregnant and was holding my upset  year old. I waited patiently for people to leave a table and then, completely exhausted, sat down with my son. The manager told me I had to get up and wait longer because there were others waiting in front of me. I understand that there are others waiting, but sometimes common courtesy should trump order. Especially when it is seat yourself, and youre telling a super pregnant woman she has to get up with her toddler. Shame on that manager. The food wasnt worth it.

Paid  for a ticket with a disclaimer that said, Guaranteed entrance before  p.m..  Tiesto didnt play until  a.m.  nnIm paying  for a ticket.  The least they can do is reserve a spot for people who paid money in advanced. I am aware that this is a growing trend among clubs...which is total bullshit!!!nnAnyways, got in, realized it was way too crowded to the point where you are almost touching hands with whoever is next to you, and walked towards the back of the club.  Even though it was a little bit better, these spots were right behind the bottle service tables.  The people who had bottle service stood on their seating area totally reasonable as they paid for it, making it impossible for anyone near the back to see the main stage.  nnOverall, pretty terrible experience as far as how the place was set up.  The sound systems werent set up well and the sounds were piercing at times.  Visual effects were extremely mediocre. oz bottle of water half of your normal water bottle was . nn star for Tiesto."
0,"Hello, nnLet me bulletize the list of reasons why I was disappointed in a tournnI was told that  there will be a bathroom on Friday because many people are buying a tour and waited till then because my mom has IBS and cant go on tours without a bathroom near by.  In the end there was no bathroom even on a Friday we waited fornnWhen we came the bus driver was about  minutes late. nnWhen he arrived he said that two of our tickets are expired even though I sent you guys all  vouchers before and you guys accepted and validated them for the very date we booked it for.  He even said I wouldnt get my moms sandwich because her tour expried. This is really just unprofessional. nnIve never had a tour cruise where wed constantly get either warm or cold because there doesnt seem to be proper distribution of AC or something. also even the bus driver complained about not having temp control so wed have to yell to him too cold or too hot. nnFluorescent lights were out and not working so we couldnt light up a bus in the evening to see if we are forgetting something or safely leave.nnThe bus was nearly  hours late arriving to Las Vegas because ONE couple didnt listen to perfectly clear instructions by the bus driver of where to meet. We had to drive around back and forth in the park and arrived around pm at our bus stop finally. This is highly disrespectful towards  other bus customers of yours, it was neither our fault nor the fault of the driver that one idiot couple screwed us up. nnI had plans to meet someone at Hilton and was almost  hours late.  You guys should absolutely not penalize  people because one couple simply didnt follow instructions. our cruises depart ON TIME regardless of excuses of other people missing it and thats in Los Angeles where traffic is very unpredictable. nnThe Groupon statesnn Comedy on Decks tours are led by standup comedians, who are trained to keep things PG and interact with everyone onboard. After catching their breath, chuckledout tour takers have complimented the guides for seamless weaving of history, geography, and familyfriendly punch lines.nnI specifically purchased it over competition because its a long tour and I was expecting some entertainment but the driver just chuckled and said we dont have time for entertainment on such long tours and you get a comedian on short tours like Hoover Dam.  Instead we were given some videos to watch in a screen that is so small on the front of the bus that is nearly impossible to see from the rear of the bus. nnJust minor item, bus has no elevated views and the front view is entire blocked by Krystal sign so you cant see anything front. Were on a tour, it may seem like a small detail to you but its a huge detail for a bus tour."
0,"Our fridge went out, so I called American Home Shield AHS and they sent these people out.  They came, said that a few things where wrong and ordered parts.  I was called back shortly just couple of days to schedule to get it fixed. They came out and replaced the parts.  I thought great! Now we have a working fridge again.  Nope not at all.  Nothing they did made any difference. Even the ice maker they replaced didnt work. the old one kinda worked at least it made ice.  I called to get them back out.  They flat refused to come back and fix anything.  I was told that everything had to be done through AHS.  So I will be with out a fridge for another week while these clowns make excuses why what they did doesnt work."
0,"I am extremely disappointed with the service. Both of my dogs are poodles and were not cut correctly.  My dogs have been to this groomer at least  times and they did not follow the notes from the last  visits.  Both dogs no longer have full ears, the groomer cut the ears too short and trimmed down the top knot so now they have flat heads.  They did not follow the Mohawk for my male dog and completely trimmed it down to nothing but a flat head and small line down the base of his back.  I spoke with one of the owners who mentioned he didnt know what he can do to help me, Really???! ! ! Never going to this place again the owner offered no money back and told us to request a groomer so the other groomers dont mess up!"
0,"After coming to this car wash a few times, I was only semisatisfied with their car washes. I have tried the  wash and the most expensive and neither of them are anything special. My last visit I used the  wash and not only did the attendant completely ignore me when I tried to get his attention to rinse off my tires, but at the end of the wash my car was still soaking wet. There are so many better washes in the area with great customer service, save yourself time and money by going somewhere else!"
0,"Ladies free before AM to get in, and cheap drinks. I didnt really like it because the music thats playing is from the jukebox and not everyone has great taste. Im not really a slow RnB person when it comes to shaking it and thats what we got. The country wasnt too bad not a country person but at least it was danceable. This is just not really my scene. Maybe someone elses...."
0,One pickle? Received a calendar for Christmas from my motherinlaw....you receive one free item per month. January was the chicken sandwich. I have never eaten at chickfila but one pickel? Tasty chicken but dry sandwich. Most of the rest of the months are free soda...should be safe there.
0,"At first I was very impressed with Window World. The sales guy was very friendly and gave us a  discount off of our  windows and sliding door. Plus their lifetime warranty was great! We ended up going with them. We were told it would take  weeks for the windows to come in and it did. The day after they came in we got a call to schedule an appt. We explained to them originally that my husband would be cutting a hole in our wall for the sliding door so we wanted a Monday appt. We scheduled the appointment two weeks after the windows came in on a Monday and my husband cut the hole and put up a couple sheets of plywood to cover it temporarily until the next day when we thought our windows would be installed. nnThey were supposed to be here between . At am a rep from their company calls and tells me that the installer cant come out today and they need to reschedule to Wednesday!!!!!!! When I asked why he wouldnt be out they said car trouble. I get it stuff happens. However, I told her that Wednesday is absolutely not ok because I have a huge hole in my wall and my house is not secure! She responded with, Ya they told me that. Are you kidding me?! So instead of switching someone elses appointment to get me in due to this being a little more urgent their attitude was pretty much tough luck. I told them I needed to get my windows in the next day which they did.nnThe installer who came was great. I have no complaints about the person who installed my windows. However, the next thing that happens is not only my sliding glass door  inches too small but my living room window is also the wrong size! He explained how sorry he was and that the person who measured was obviously wrong. He finished installing the other windows and explained to me that he would put a rush on the order for the door and window and that it would take  weeks and not worry about paying the remaining balance until the job is finished. Which is also what my contract says.nnWhen I call the office about the windows they wanted me to pay more money. Not just that but they tell me that the person who measured my windows isnt trained to do that. Really?! Then why was he allowed to measure them. I argued back and forth with them for a bit and tell them that what I have already paid completely covers the installation and all the windows that were installed and that my contract states I dont have to pay in full until ALL of my windows are installed properly. It took my husband getting on the phone and requesting to speak with the manager that they finally said not to worry about it until all windows are installed.nnSo I call on a Thursday to see if my windows have come in which they did because it has been three weeks and they say that they cant schedule an appointment yet because their general manager handles the scheduling. So at the end of the next day when I still have not heard anything I call back and she tells me the person who schedules isnt in. I didnt get a call back from them until Wednesday the following week so theres almost a whole week my windows were sitting there! nnThey finally got installed after about  weeks! Totaling  weeks from the first order! I would not recommend this place to anyone. Their customer service is terrible and they have an I dont care attitude when they are the ones that make the mistake! If I could give them  stars I would have. nnAgain I will say that the person who was contracted through window world to physically install my windows was great! He did a good job."
0,"Like Yelps awesome description for each star ranking,this place is really just meh.nnGreat place to JUST have drinks on the terrace during the warm summer daysnights.nnFood I mean, its Italian food. Theres really nothing that great about it, and without tooting my own horn, I feel theres a lot of things on the menu that my friends and I could make. But yes, it is good.nnStaff  Nothing special, but nothing bad neither. nnDecorambiance  probably one of the good things of this place. It has a nice urbanold style to it. nLOCATION LOCATION LOCATION. This place is perfectly located on one of the most touristy streets in the city. nnId take friends there only if we havent made plansreservations. Its acceptable."
0,"Extremely overpriced buffet, with low food quality. The brunches are ok after a late night... waffle machines, ondemand omelets, cereal, and donutssweets. Everything is very heavy and unhealthy, though. Be prepared to gain the freshman  very quickly if you eat here a lot. They try to rotate dinner foods, but everything starts to taste the same after a while. They clearly reuse foods from one day to the next which is pretty sketch. The servers tend to be pretty nice, though, which is surprising considering the messiness of the student patrons. I think I mayve eaten dinner here once after no longer being on the mandatory meal plan, and thats totally ok with me."
0,"I was a little buzzed when i was at the restaurant with my friends but i remember a good amount of my experience here.nnThe waitress was a little rude and seemed like she couldnt wait to get off work. I asked her about a the fried tofu to see if it was vegan and she just said no without any explanation or suggestions of any alternatives that are vegan. One of my friends wanted to know why it wasnt vegan so i asked and she replied with because of the sugar. i looked at her confused and asked what she meant because sugar comes from sugar cane, a plant. she responded with a very condescending attitude as if i were stupid and said that the sugar came from animal bone. Later on I looked up on my phone what she was talking about and they actually do use ingredients that are derived from bone char... gross By this point i got really frustrated and changed my order to the buddhas feast which was truly vegan. The wait for our food was ridiculously long and i am not exaggerating because i had been drinking. My friends can also confirm that it took forever to receive our food. We were actually in a hurry to meet up with a friend to get into a club. Once the food arrived it was alright but it was literally steamed vegetables with small slices of tofu mixed in. I got bored of this very easily also. I had to order two sides of rice because steamed vegetables would not be enough for a long night of drinking and dancing..nnTry something else on the strip, you can get p f changs anywhere! I didnt find it to be anything special."
0,The place was empty but we still had to wait a while for our food to come out and it was cold.  Not crazy about the crabby service either.  Its a shame because its so close to home.  We wont be going back
0,"stars.. The worst, just found out they lied about sprinklers in house being unusable, they cut off both swamp coolers and sprinklers saying they didnt work which is actually Benjamin Franklin which broke them. Now Im paying tons of money to fix the mess the Benjamin Franklin made, simply to get my water turned on. Swamp cooler needed over  in repair because they cut off the water line to it and the garage swamp coolers now broken as well for the same reason.nnWas told the three waterlines that he cut when reconnecting the water to the house did nothing but in reality it was to the two swamp coolers and the sprinklers.nnWhen I finally got the lines reconnected that BF cut, the sprinklers worked fine. I would say this is the worst experience Ive ever had with a company.nnOn top of this they were incredibly rude and awful. Thought they were one of the worst companies Ive ever dealt with before but now that I found out that he screwed over my entire house as well as being incredibly rude and slow and overpriced, im in utter shock that any company could be so terrible.nnThis has already cost several hundred and is going cost me thousands of dollars to repair the damage that this company has done to my house."
0,Room was pretty clean. Towels smelled bad. Could feel every spring in the bed and pillows were a joke. Whole place smelled of stale smoke. Gave it  stars since it was in a good area and sheets seemed clean.
0,"I usually go here when Biaz is not available. And I would usually go to fattoush also before I go here. But fattoush made me sick once and that was it. This place is family owned and operated. The meat and bread are good but the rice is not. It tastes weird. Also your meal does not come with pita bread or hummus. They have no middle eastern sodas or gourmet sodas, just Pepsi products. The Mother who is the cook is the only nice person there. The younger boys will treat you funny if you are not middle eastern. And dont expect a damn thing from the younger women working there. I dont feel to much racial tension here vs other places. But as an African women I do know they can be more respectful. The Baklava was soggy this time."
0,"We have been going to this restaurant since it open  maybe  years.  It has always been wonderful.  We went yesterday.  It must have changed hands.  The food was bad, at best.  We had spring rolls.  There were chunks of dry bread in them and the wrapper was so hard you couldnt bite it.  I have never ever had dry bread in a spring roll.  I had the tom yum soup.  It had no flavor at all.  There were a few pieces of tomato in it.  From the look and taste I think the cook stirred a bit of instant tom yum paste in to some broth.  I feel really bad that someone has messed up this restaurant.  I guess we will be finding a new one"
0,"I have celiac disease and usually dont have an issue with Chipotle. However, today at this location the girl was a complete mess. She didnt understand what celiac disease was, my specific instructions or the need to change her gloves. It wasnt even busy, I wont ever be back.

0,My friend and I went to get a full set and gel polish. Her polish came out wonderful but my new set was horrible. She used the wrong brush and it had old dry acrylic in it and she put a bunch of acrylic on my nail so I simply told her that I did not like it that thick and she started shaking said go back to where I got my nails done before and she took off all my nails and left them like that. She acted like no one ever told her that they did not like something.
0,"Tryst was not what I expected it to be. This club gets overcrowded and there is just no space to dance at all. I have experienced crowded clubs before, but this is by far the worst. I give it two stars because of the music and of course Lil Jon knows how to get a party started. I know its a Saturday but I choose Tao over this club. The restroom lines were super long and I just wasnt feeling it that night."
0,"Trying to capitalize on the Hooters gig, Tilted Kilt fails.nnThe waitstaff is OK. Having to prance around in those little outfits may please the male clientele but I dont know... maybe Im getting old or maybe its because I have daughters that age but its kinda degrading... Our waitress had to be no more than ....she still had braces. Looked at my receipt when I got home and she even charged us for too many beers. nnFood was typical bar food. I had a burger and it was no better and no worse than any burger Ive had in any sports bar in America. Nothing to write home about. nnLots of TVs. I even got to see my beloved Phillies on a screen right in front of me.nnAll in all, its a gimmick. Stay away."
0,"If youre okay with settling for mediocrity, then this is the place for you. nnUnsanitary, lazy service. The girl used the same cuticle clipper that she used on my pedicure for the manicure. She didnt even bother to wipe the clippers clean so the collected cuticle bits were trapped away in the crevices of the clippers. nnThe drying station is a greasy table where everybody places their nails to dry by the distant heat of a dinky light bulb that hangs overhead. Youll be waiting at least an hour if you opt to dry your nails this way as the heat emitted by the light bulb does nothing but shine light on your lessthangreat manicure. nnnThere are better, cleaner, FRIENDLIER places."
0,This review is soley on the fact that the time is wrong!!! They close the kitchen at pm . And it shows that its open till am??? Wtf???? So pissed of that i drove  min for them to tell me this!!!! nnSo dont waste ur time coming here late! nSo dissapointed!
0,Came in a couple of weeks ago with  out of town guests after bragging about how good the pizza  is and the closest thing to Chicago thin crust.  Well we were disappointed to say the least. Waited an hour and  minutes for our order. Granted they were very busy but the person ahead of us placed his order for a large group and not only were they served well before us but were finished eating before we got our order. No apology for the wait and worst of all the pizza crust was terrible. We were regulars here but no more.
0,"ok.  here goes...nI come to vegas about  times a year for about the last  years.  I live in Los Angeles, it only  hours or so.  I have stayed everywhere in the past and just wanted a change of pace from the Wynn.  I drove in during horrible rain and snow, it took  hours.  I arrive at hotel around , go to counter and try to check in.  The system is down, it wont let me check you in yet  I love any line that begins with the system.  I said, ok.  When can I.  around .  no probem.  I go play blackjack, have lunch and come back.  im sorry, the system all over again.  This time it wont let them check in till .  Ok I said.  Walked around, had a cocktail, played blackjack.    I go back, line down the counter like  people deep.  Im in line.   guys in suits walking past the line, one says to the other is this cause of the computer thing?  the other says, Ill take care of it.  he goes to the counter, leans over and picks up a phone, calls someone, and boom!  everyone is being checked in promptly.  Does this mean if someone told these higherups earlier, maybe we could have checked in then??  I wonder.  The real problem is just that the people working there were like drones, not a bit of personality at all.  A bunch of im sorry while they look in another direction.  pretty rude.nI finally got to check in and decided to upgrade for  bucks more a night for a newly remodeled larger room.  mostly cause I had work to do online, as well as wanted to watch basketball on an lcd tv, not an old boat anchor crt.  it was a fairly lame vegas night, but who cares, Im always here.  I watched  games, did my work and ordered room service.  Room service was very friendly, but the food was dumpy.  barely cafeteria level, although sounded good on menu.nOne other thing,   While the hotel room looks like its clean, its not.  Up close revealed a booger on the bathroom floor the size of a dime.  also looks like people puke around the toilet and it goes unscrubbed.  It just clean on top of dried puke and pee.  Im keeping my socks on at all times.  The upgrade also landed me in a room that has a view of air conditioning units and some sidestreet off the strip.  So, anyway, thats my first night, Im getting ready to leave the room and have a late breakfast or lunch, its around  am now.  I will leave another update after checkout tomorrow.  I hope it gets better between now and then."
0,"I was telling a friend about my singular experience with Wienerschnitzel, and she reported similar feelings, so I thought I should warn others about my experience. nnI ate at this location once when I was in high school, before I became very healthconscious, and it was a very memorable experience because it was so unpleasant.  I cant remember exactly what I ordered, but it was one of the hot dogs with onion and peppers on it, which I remember were overly greasy, soggy and limp.  It looked like gelatinous mush.  There was no pride or integrity in the way it was put together.  I dont know how to describe the taste exactly, but I clearly remember that it didnt taste natural or right.  It tasted unnatural and wrong, like is was tainted in some way.  For some reason  I guess i was hungry and didnt want to waste my money  I ate the whole hotdog.  I remember feeling queasy afterwards, like my stomach had been insulted and abused.  That was the day I made a personal vow never to eat at Wienerschnitzel again, and I am reaffirming that vow today."
0,"Since I got back into student mode a couple of weeks ago, Ive had a chance to get reacquainted with Orbit. Meh.nnHere are some observationsn The homeless drunks still find a way on the bus at AM.n Each driver has their own interpretations of where the route goes, which neighborhoods are flagstops, bus capacity, etc. Those interpretations almost never err on the side of good customer service.n Why so many fuckwads that spend  minutes waiting for a bus, only to get off at the next stop? Its a  minute walk. Stop slowing the bus down!n The bus capacity is listed as  seated   standing, and usually somewhere between  passengers will be on the bus as it approaches ASU, depending on the mood of the driver. It is never under max capacity. I have seen literally hundreds of people not get picked up over the past two weeks. They could use fullsize Valley metro buses and they would still fill up.nnSo, one star because I cant give it zero, plus one more because its free. Though you get what you pay for."
0,"I had a bad allergic reaction with extreme swelling of the face and neck so I rushed to Dr. Tottoris office he has been my Dr. for about  months, his office is  minutes from my home and I wanted him to see the swelling.  It was about  and the waiting room was empty, but the nurse said that Dr. Tottori was still in.  When I asked if it would be possible to be seen by him to show him the swelling the nurse excused herself and went to ask him, I waited, after a few minutes she returned to tell me he said if I had called he would have seen me, but since I hadnt Id have to wait till the next day.  I was stunned and ask if she were kidding . . . my face continued to swell and I insisted on being seen by someone, at this point I was really getting scared.   After a few minutes one of the nursespractioners came out and told me I should come back the next day, but that I might want to go to the emergency room right now if I started to have trouble breathing.  As I was leaving they asked if Id like to make an appointment for the next day . . . The only thing that I did the next day was find a new Dr.  I would not reccommend this office to anyone."
0,"If I could give less than one star I would. Went in to Dannys at Tempe Marketplace yesterday for an oil change. I decided to upgrade the car wash to The Works for an extra . When I got my car back I opened the drivers side door to immediately notice the carpets. They did a terrible job vacuuming. I would honestly be surprised if they told me they vacuumed for more than two minutes. I bring it to a car wash expecting it to be returned to me in a cleaner state than I dropped it off. They slacked on the quality of service I would expect from this place.  Not only were my carpets dirty, but my window and roof of my car had TWO bird poops stains that were still there. I find that unacceptable. There is no excuse except laziness. I even upgraded the car wash to make sure those would be taken care of. I then notice that the interior of my car still had dust and scruff marks on the doors. Those could easily be taken care of with a rag. This was not the first time I have been disappointed with Dannys but I guarantee you it will be my last. I highly suggest to avoid this place at all costs. I have even wrote to Dannys to let them know my feedback privately and I have yet to hear from them. Stay away and spend your money elsewhere. Wherever you go will be sure to do a better job than this place."
0,"Dont go here. The food came out cold and was way overpriced. Cheaper and tastier meals are everywhere in Vegas, so dont give this place another thought. I would suggest going to Panda Express for a more authentic experience. Yes, Panda Express  More Authentic Experience.nnFor a city filled with Asian gamblers, it was odd to see no other Asian person dinning at an Asian restaurant always a big negative in my book. Maybe their frequent game play has given then enough comps to dine elsewhere, so Ill give this place the benefit of the doubt as far a demographically biased portion of my rating goes.nnI ordered the prix fixe menu where the main course was braised sea bass. The sea bass was more boiled than braised. It was texturally unappealing and had no flavor. The greens that accompanied it were overcooked and essentially dead. nnI really should have just gone to the food court...."
0,"We went to Jacks because of the great reviews, but I simply dont know where all these positive vibes are coming from. Its currently located in an industrial area not surprising, but still a bit sketchy, and we were literally the ONLY car in the parking lot other than that of the employees. This was on a Saturday afternoon too, so not exactly a dead time for shopping.nnThe selection was limited, and the saleswoman there did not even notice we had entered until wed been wandering around for about five minutes. Keep in mind, we were the only customers in the store now I know why. The prices were mediocre not great, but not terrible. I will say this they did have a fantastic art collection on the walls. I might go back for artwork, but with the indifferent sales team and the odddeserted location I would not recommend this store for furniture shopping."

0,"I had a very underwhelming experience compared to the other reviews here. The service was subpar, wait staff were busy and missed us sitting in the bar area for a while, then I ordered a drink that never came. Appetizers were good and an OK value. The entree was a major let down, I ordered the  shellfish sampler and I felt jipped. Small pieces of seafood that were overcooked and left me unsatisfied. I think they were frozen. I would not recommend the dish. I had to order the Aloha rolls afterwards to fill me up, which were decent.nnOverall there are much better happy hours and dinner places around town, this spot is located alongside a lot of other high end restaurants and probably benefits from location greatly."
0,"Food Decent quantity and average quality. Wings were sauced well but could have been warmer. Perhaps they were sitting too long? nnService Atrocious. The waitress had no clue what beers the store served not everything on the menu was served and no less than  times, provided incorrect information about their beer selections. Aka  yes we have wood chuck cider,  min later  no we dont serve wood chuck cider Took forever to get our drinks.  min for  of us on a dead Monday evening.

0,"Ive frequented Honey Pig on several occasions a few years back with my friends for some good food and drinks. Every time I was here though, I felt that the waitress would look down on me as if I was a  year old child and it wouldnt matter what I would say or want from her, she would simply ignore it. After these repetitious experiences, I stopped visiting until one day my family was moving. My poor father, sister, and boyfriend had worked up a sweat all day long without water in the desert heat and decided to come to Honey Pig since it was the closest Korean restaurant.nnWhen we walked in, the place was busy but not packed. We were asked to pick a seat and was given the menu and iced water to start hallelujah. We finished the pitcher of water faster than you can say Mississippi and asked for another pitcher of water. The waitress eagerly answered yes but did not budge from where she was standing. She continued her conversation with a fellow waitress and I kept giving her an evil glare, hoping that shell feel my radiating energy but she didnt. When she finally moved to take our orders, I asked for water again and without apologies, asked her coworker to grab another pitcher for us. nnAfter waiting a good while for our food, it finally arrived. The bulgogi was a little dry and too sweet. Even though we had been moving all day and thus starving, we were hesitant to finish the meal. At one point, my dad asked for some more lettuce and jalapenos and, no kidding, had to ask  times before someone even pretended to listen to our needs. I ordered the naengmyun and I must say its one of the worst Ive ever tasted and let me just tell you, Im a naengmyun fanatic and have had my fair share of good and bad noodles. It was simply salty and nothing more to it. I must have taken three bites before I put my chopsticks down and refused to eat any more.nnIve held a tipdependent job since my freshman year in high school and Id like to think that I know what good service is. Unless I am highly dissatisfied, I tip at least  wherever I go. However, at the end of our meal I told my dad that he should only leave a  tip because of the less than desirable food and even more horrible service. nnI guess if I was starving for a week without water, Id rate the food as decent but simply for service, I would never come back. I dont know how I even entertained the idea of coming back here after such a horrible experience but I know now, never again."
0,"Wow, even with low expectations, this place was awful.  There was over an hour wait, the waiting area was hot, and the food was actually bad.  Not just not good  it was bad.  We choked down some pasta and left asap.  Even with a Groupon, we felt like it was a bad decision."
0,"Hmm... Im not quite sure what this is supposed to be, but I guess the closest comparison is to a piece of soggy bread. The tiramisu was good, but a restaurant shouldnt take pride in its desserts being better than its signature product."
0,"We went here for our anniversary dinner. I wasnt that impressed. My husband picked out this resturaunt because of the other rave reviews. nnHonestly, I felt like I was going blind with the very dim lighting.

When I got my Filet i know, i know, who orders a filet at an italian resturaunt? keep reading about how the server answered my questions and youll understand why i decided to go with the safe bet it only emphasized my feelings. I ordered a medium  medium rare filet, and it definitly came out closer to well done. I didnt find that out til after i took a bite into it, and immedietly spit it back out. The wine flavor isnt my thing, and the well done thing isnt either. My dog loved it though! nnWhen i asked the waitress about a certain dish, she replied back like I was an idiot. Rather than answering a yes or no question on a sauce, she detailed the process of how the sauce is made, still without answering my question. Maybe that was lack of communication. Had it not been my anniversary dinner, i think i would have dug more for my answer.nnI did enjoy how the cookowner of the resturaunt came and greated our table, and asked how our dinner was. That was a nice touch. But our server didnt pay much attention to us regardless of how few people were there. All in all, I kind of wish my husband had taken us across the street to Postinos rather than here. I probably should have voiced an opinion here or there, but again. It was supposed to be a nice night out, so i didnt want my husband to think he had done a horrible job in choosing a resturaunt. But later, when we discussed it, he said i should write a review, just so others could get a heads up! If youre looking for a nice, dark night out, to keep to yourselves, where you could probably get a bit frisky in the corner if your adventerous enough! this may be the place for you!"
0,"Thinking about going here for a beforeshow dinner some evening?  You might want to think again.  Gertrudes is set up as a fine dining restaurant but it falls short in lots of ways.nnFirst ambiance  Gertrudes is located near the entrance to the Desert Botanical Garden in an area that used to be part of the gift shop.  It still looks like an empty retail space with tables and chairs arranged in rows.  Besides having the warmth of a high school cafeteria, Gertrudes is incredibly noisy.  Strike one.nNote There is also a more inviting outside dining area if the weather is cool enough.  nnSecond service  the kitchen is way too slow.  We arrived almost an hour and a half before our show time to find a filled restaurant.  Our server asked if we had to get out in time for a show and we told her.  Thirty minutes later our appetizers arrived.  Thirtyfive minutes after that I was ready to walk out because there was scarcely time left to eat before our show.  Our server kept telling us just a few more minutes.  In the end we got our main courses barely in time to eat them, and certainly with no time for dessert.  Strike two.nnThird food  spotty.  For example, the pork trio had delicious thinlysliced leg, but the sausage was blank and the pork loin dried out.  The short ribs were blah.  The burrata appetiser was very small for the price, and the bread you need to order it separately for about  was a berry loaf of some kind that didnt work well with anything else we ordered.  Thats right  no free bread.  Strike three.nnGood points  The price was halfway reasonable for fine dining.  Too bad this wasnt fine dining, which is after all about a total experience and not just the food.  A couple of the items we were served were very tasty.  The Desert Botanical Garden itself is fabulous.  Thats about it.  Sorry."
0,"This place used to be amazing. The prices were great and the stylists were better than the just out of school types you find at SuperCuts. Unfortunately, my monthly hair cuts turned into minute sales pitches where I was encouraged to buy expensive shampoos, conditioners, and styling gels. nnThe worst part is that the various stylists were increasingly insulting saying things like, you see how your hair is kind of shiny? Thats because youre using cheap gel. Redken makes a special gel that isnt shiny. Your hair would look so much better. Its only . plus tax. nnThe stylists are also less and less efficient. Ive showed up a number of times and been told that there is just one person ahead of you, so  minutes tops. After  minutes, I simply didnt have enough time to stay any longer.nnIf you dont mind having your hair products insulted while they twist your arm trying to get you to buy expensive salon products for the ENTIRE  minutes, then the price is great. After my last four cuts have been dominated by lengthy sales pitches, Im unwilling to go back."
0,While this place does have an extensive menu  the wait is ridiculous.  You get a number and sit at a table waiting for your food.  This is even if you order to go.  I waited over  min for a breakfast sandwich   which still came out wrong.  The sandwiches on the lunch menu sound so enticing that I decided to try it again.  I called in an order this time and went to pick it up  min later than they said  still not ready.  The prices are way higher than anywhere else around there and it is honestly not worth it.
0,"This park is on the dirty side with broken glass in the parking lot. We had to be careful with our dogs. We only went here a couple of times. Lots of people have parties here, though. So, its popular with that crowd I wasnt sure if they were families, but they were having a BBQ. I did notice that the basketball courts had quite a few people there. We havent been there recently."
0,"When I was younger, I used to HATE going here. For one thing, my mom loved it, so I felt like I was here weekly. I would temper tantrum out, in screaming, stomping fits of tearful rage until we either left the store or Id convinced her not to go at all. nnIve grown up a lot since my early twenties."
0,"Usually this place is good. The last two times I was here they were awful. My acrylic nail broke after about a week and toenail polish came off. The next time I went back the gel polish started to come off. The lady put three coats of the gel polish on. She should know you cant do that or else it will peel off. So it peeled off. Now I have to take another  minutes out of my Sunday to go back  have them repainted, that includes the wait time. I will not be coming back here again"
0,"This place was a HUGE disappointment. It is a nice enough building but is showing some age. The problem came with their customer service, or general lack thereof. To be fair this was my first stay in a Las Vegas casinohotel. What a total disappointment. Thank goodness I was there as a guest and didnt have to pay or I would have probably moved before ever checking in. No need to get into a bunch of whiny crap but I would say I heard very similar complaints from most everyone in our group.it was a very large group also The shopping was OK One of the stores had a Blancpain I have been trying to find in person. That, a nice suite, and the few competent staff is the reason for  stars and not . I would not recommend anyone stay here."
0,"As a Hilton Diamond Member, I have spent my last stay at this hotel. I have trie to stay loyal but I must move on, and I will. Two nights in a row, poor service in the restaurant has forced me to leave and go out to dinner elsewhere last night and I even tried tonight and again after waiting over twenty minute, I came to my room without eating. I left a message for Rosa but to no avail, she never returned my call.nnThe safe in the room doesnt work, the dresser has bubbles on the top and the shower leaks consistently.nnThere are better places to stay and I will find it, even if I have to choose a Marriott. I am disappointed but you have the right to know."
0,"I would love this place if it wasnt for the food. I like how it is painted on the outside and inside it is all bright colors with different colored chairs. And I think the cheesy duecor is pretty cool, too. I love the giant margarita glasses and Mexican Talavera pottery style birds everywhere. The service is passable. But I just cant eat here. Not that this location is particularly bad food or anything. I just really dont like Macayos. Way too much cheese all over everything. Their chips are like cardboard and the salsa never tastes fresh. The tortillas are not authentic Mexican at all. The one thing I do appreciate is that they give you the option of having calabacitas sautueed diced zucchini and corn kernels as a side dish.  I wish other Mexican places would have a veggie side as an option in addition to the usual rice and beans they do offer black beans, too which is also nice."
0,Have to say this location totally dropped the ball on Launch day of the iPhone .  Stood in line for  hours and never once did any of the employees follow apples policy on this launch day.  They said their system was down but never once did they come out with the cards needless to say I didnt get my iPhone  plus would of been nice to know this maybe after an hour after open not  hours later.   I will never show up for a launch day at this location ever again.  Ive never seen customer service this bad especially at apple.  If I didnt hate android so much this wouldve been my breaking point.  For now Ill just drive a little farther and visit another store in the valley.
0,I have gone to this location for  years. Service has always been friendly and helpful. After reading a review I understand ownership changed.  The owners son was extremely arrogant without an ounce of customer service.  I showed up with just  shirts  minutes after closing .  The door was open and he was sitting there reading a book. I offered to write my name and number and leave the shirts on the counter to be processed Monday. He refused to accept the items.  others showed up behind me and he also refused their items too. The mother drove up and said she would take the items and he ran out screaming at his mother to leave and he stated he has plenty of other business and he was more than happy to say I am happy to lose you as a customer.  Come back Monday if you want your shirts done.  He accomplished his goal of losing me as a customer.
0,"We got the all you can eat option. I was very happy to see sashimi on the menu. Our server was great. The food came out pretty slow, but it was a Friday night after all. The nigiri was good, but everything else we ordered was average. I wrote this review bc of the sashimi they gave us. The pieces were leftover odds and ends. We had two thin slivers of red snapper, a piece of salmon the size of a square pinky, and all the pieces had muscle fibers that were chewy. I couldnt believe they would serve that. They should be embarrassed."
0,"If it were a few years ago, I wouldve recommended Stripburger. It used to be a favorite. Prices went up, competition grew fierce and it wasnt as convenient for me to frequent it so its been a long while since Ive been. nnMy brother and I  were reminiscing and decided to grab dinner there tonight. I was pleased to see they still had the atomic fries on the menu. I recall them being delicious. They were still good, but I missed the heavy hand of jalapenos. These were pretty sparse. I ordered the jalapeno popper burger and he couldnt choose between the BBQ Whiskey burger or the Blue burger so he opted for the sampler of three sliders so he could try them both. He also got a shake since he used to love it. The burgers should have been prepared medium, they were medium well at best. The buns were dry, the meat crumbled. The fried cheese on my burger tasted like flour and grease. I pulled it off so it would be edible. His BBQ burger came with mayo and really threw off the flavor. At least, the shake was decent.nnThe waitress never asked how our meal was, but she was pretty prompt refilling drinks and taking our order.  later, we were wishing we went to In  Out and bought doubles for everyone in line. Money would have been better spent. Its a shame how bad this place has become."
0,"I really wasnt in the mood for a buffet so I walked right past the one in the Excalibur on my way to see what Luxor had in the way of a coffee shop.  I wanted food cooked to order for me.  My food came out really fast.  I would be real surprised if any of it did not come from a warming tray.  The eggs were watery, the corned beef hash was dried out, I could only deal with part of the potatoes, the toast served wrapped in a basket was too cold even when it first got there to melt the butter.  The orange juice was really good and the decaf was ok.  nnThe service was good and friendly.  The chairs were comfortable to lounge back in but not very comfortable to sit up to the table in.nnOverall I was not really impressed paying  more plus tip for the same quality of food I could have gotten from the buffet."
0,"From an aesthetical point of view, your hotel is nice. However, from a functional point of view, I dont know that I would stay here again. The walls are way too thin. The room next to mine had their TV on extremely loud until ridiculous hours even AFTER I put my headphones on, I could still hear. I would think twice before putting TVs up against the same wall as beds in the next room. It was absolutely horrible. The cordless phone on my nightstand did not work and the wireless Internet connection was very weak and I needed to reconnect frequently. My suggestion would also be to spring for a better brand of toilet paper. We dont live in Europe in the s. I would expect something better than sandpaper. Next time I come to Vegas, I will spring the extra  for a better experience elsewhere."
0,My wife took me there for my birthday.  Service was horrible!  We had to wait  minutes for a waiter to acknowledge us and a total of  minutes before we received our salad and soup.  The manager was just as poor as the waiter.  They both gave us different stories for the delays.  Will NEVER eat there again.  Food was average.
0,"Disappointed. nnI came here on a Saturday night for dinner. There was a live band that took nearly our entire meal to set up. They were testing their equipment and the sound the entire time we were there. While they were setting up, the restaurant was trying to hide how loud the band was by blaring loud music overhead. I do like loud music, just not blaring like were at AxisRadius while Im eating. nnThe service was ok. The drinks took longer than our appetizers. They didnt even have enough shrimp to fill our one order of coconut shrimp. I had to get up and get my own salt and pepper from the bar after not seeing my server for nearly  mins after our entrees arrived. nnThe food was AWFUL! I ordered the salmon and my boyfriend some handmade pasta Alfredo dish. Mine was just salmon and couscous. Nothing special and bland. The dish wasnt seasoned. My boyfriend had the same problem with his food, bland. Right after we left I felt sick after eating the little bit of food I did consume. nnTo top off our super great experience we were overcharged for our wine on the bill. At this point we were far too annoyed to say anything and just paid the overage and left. I think its safe to say we wont be coming  back. Such a shame too, considering weve been looking for a great new place. Stay clear of this overpriced gross food. You would be much happier with basically any other restaurant in Old Town."
0,"The name is a little misleading.  They serve everything from Fish  Chips to Pizza.  I was staying at the Marriott up the street and I didnt want to take the bus into town to get food.  I walked by this place and decided that I wanted to try some fish  chips while I am in the UK.  They only have takeaway.  It is one huge piece of fried fish.  It was piping hot and made everything soggy after being wrapped up.  They dont have any sauce to go with it.  The fish tasted fishy and I couldnt even get vinegar to take with me.  The lady sprinkled some on for me.  It is definitely a local spot, but not all local spots  good spots."
0,"Had my little dog in my cart for the farmers market. Not bothering anyone until we came under the lens of officer do right, and we were told to leave a public side walk. Farmers market not a pet friendly place."
0,"Sooooo disappointed. Wow. Beautiful view, nice pleasant staff, horrendous inedible food. Orzo was rock hard and greasy, crab on top of Dover sole literally looked like vomit. Potato wrapped salmon was chewy and dry. We took one bite and sent the food back and left. Waiter was super sweet and service staff was very attentive too bad the food was so awful."
0,"Was in Vegas on a business trip and decided to hit up Japonais with some coworkers.  I dont know how this place gets anything above  stars.  The famous rock they are known for is literally just a small stone they heat up and be prepared to wait while they heat it.... i guess microwaves take awhile in Vegas.  Then you get about  tiny pieces of meat to cook on the slab... All for around  bucks.  Overall this place is a waste of money, and its not even that good.  The best thing about it is the drinks... but you can just hit the bar for that."

0,"Needs some time to mature. Quite a few of the stores were empty, Some of the businesses didnt seem very well stocked or staffed. The restrooms were nice though, clean anyway. If I happen to be in the area again, maybe Ill stop by and see how its going but otherwise nothing here to make me want to drive across town to visit."
0,Server had no personalitybad start. Pizza was more like one you would purchase in the frozen food aisle. Crust tasted stale and flat. Cheese quality was below average.  price tag was over the top. Many better choices in Las Vegas .
0,"If you know good Mexican food, this is not the place for you.  I ordered the enchiladas de pollo and what I was served didnt even vaguely resemble enchiladas.  If they at least were good, I wouldnt be so angry at the expensive price tag.  But flour tortillas not corn uncooked and doughy, filled with chicken doused in what must have been fake smoke or maybe that was in the gluey sauce poured over it all.  Couldnt even eat it.  And couldnt drown my sorrows in my  mojito because it had no rum in it. Oh, and the beans and rice were drowned in cumin.  Fast food at very unfast food price."
0,"This store is OK. It has been remodeled since the last reviewers and is clean and modern looking now. I tried the chipolte grilled chicken sandwich they have been advertising on the radio and it was bland. It was not spicy and I had pepper jack cheese on it. The chipolte sauce did not have any flavor at all. I could taste the bread over everything else. I do not recommend this sandwich unless you are looking for a bland, flavorless sandwich. nnI would like to add that the girls working the counter did a great job getting everyone through the line quickly. Sometimes when you go to Subways the people working the counter think your there just to stand and look at the ingredients under the glass."
0,"Definitely Not good service. Didnt ask if we needed shoe rentals and didnt explain anything special. The cashier forgot to ring us up for one person and our lane jammed halfway through the game. I went up to ask the desk if they could fix the jam. The person at the register at this point ended up he is the manager!! was very rude and just started yelling at me that we didnt pay for enough people. Im sorry I honestly just signed the receipt not looking at the price and had no clue that we had only paid for three people. I didnt even know the computer would allow you to play more people than paid for. He was extemely rude and did not want to fix the lanes. At this point I didnt even want to finish playing because he instantly assumed I was purposely not paying. In the customer service industry, the customer is always right and you should be nice to them if you want good reviews. I will definitely not be going back here."
0,This office has negligent and incompetent staff and ODD billing practices.nHave bills from medical insurance for sevices that should be billed to vision care.

Very disorgnaized bunch and I have no confidence in their professional services.
0,"Not even sure where to begin.  BAD.  VERY BAD.  Most of the meats were a gray color, the hot and sour soup was mustard yellow somehow...and we waited FOREVER for bad food.

0,"Ive always liked Caesars but in the past year  weve had  bad experiences. The last time I wrote and explained our issues with our room and the response was great and the service the next time, as well as the room were great. This time we have a room where the shower is extremely small, set up with a folded seat for handicap accessibility and entire bathroom way below par!  The room is nice for a Quality Inn maybe, not for Caesars. The television is so small and old we cant read the guide from bed or seating. The room is underwhelming in decor and amenities. Very disappointed in the entire experience. Ive heard others in our tower have very nice rooms."
0,"My previous review was  stars, but this time, things were different.  There were  girls behind the bar.  The one that initially took my order gave me my beer, but the beer was not very cold, and the glass appeared to have just been washed  it was warm which is not good especially when the beer is ...  I ordered a bacon cheeseburger.  After that, and I kid you not, this was the last time I was acknowledged at the bar mainly because the girl that took my order apparantly went on break and the other  did not seem to interested in taking care of me.  My cheeseburger arrived and it was well done as in over cooked so much the edges were burnt  after I had specifically ordered it medium.   When I needed another beer, I had to flag one of the bartenders down. As I was eating, I sat there for maybe  minutes with no one so much as looking at my empty beer.   She finally brought me a beer and was not polite at all acted like she was put out  no smile, no asking if I needed anything else.  I have to tell you, there were maybe  people at the bar, and these  girls could NOT handle everyone.  Yes, it was busy in the restaurant for dinner, but that does not mean they ignore the customers at the bar. The next bartender that came over to start washing the glasses, started talking to the guy next to me about her kids xmas presents  she had a loud voice and the last thing I wanted to hear was her whine about her kids while I ate my burger.  Well, that is what happened  for at least  minutes.  In a supposedly upscale place, do I really need to listen to that???  My nerves had just about had it...   When I tried to pay, I waited  minutes to get someone to take my credit card.  With no one paying attention enough to get my bill taken care of, I threw down some cash and left.  I have to tell you, I cannot remember the time I left less than  tip, but this time I did.  I could not wait to get the heck out of there.  I was not happy at all and was in fact, very upset and mad at the situation when I left.  I should have complained to the manager but just wanted to get out of there.   Next time, I will just drive thru INNNOUT and save , get better service, and better food."
0,"I am a huge fan of Gardunos in ALBUQUERQUE but not Scottsdale.  It seems like when they opened here in Scottsdale, they forgot to make sure the food tastes good.  I have been here many times and it seems like the food was frozen prior to it being served.  Also, the service is not too good.  If you sit at the bar, be prepared for an over eager, spikey haired bartender to offer you a drink.  Also be prepared for him to forget that he took your order.  Yes, this HAS happened to me.  The margaritas are WATERED DOWN and the BEERS ARE FLAT!  The best thing about this is their happy hour.  They have a lot of free food.  Of course, be prepared to get SCOWLED AT if you pig out on the food and dont have more than one beer. Haha."
0,"After eating at the District Lucilles for years, I was expecting to like this location at least as much as I like the District location.  I will say, the bar is much nicer.  The seats are comfortable, you dont feel crammed, and there are plenty of TVs.  From where we were sitting, each guy was easily able to see his NFL game of choice.  nnBut, the food fell short of the District location.  The fried onion straws were pretty much the same, they needed seasoning.  But, I find this to be the issue at the District location as well.  My catfish po boy, on the other hand, was nowhere near the quality I get at the District location.  The bread was tough, not quite stale, but certainly not fresh.  This problem was compounded by the fact that the sandwich, which comes with  sauces, was nearly dry.  So, I had to order more of each sauce a remoulade and tartar sauce.  This wait caused the sandwich to cool down, which made eating it less pleasant when I finally got the sauces.  The macaroni and cheese was standard, it was similar if not exactly the same as the District location.nnIm sure Ill give the Red Rock Lucilles another shot.  The service was good, and like I said, its a much better bar area.  But, Ill order something else and hope that this food is more similar to the food Ive enjoyed for years at the District location."

At that point I was livid. Hung up and wrote a complaint on their website. Finally of weeks of not going there I finally decided to try it again and once again I was disappointed. The food is great it just seems like their costumer service sucks. There is no difference now from that place and mcdonalds next door"

0,"If youre a hipster with a Swiss Army knife keychain, a Northface tee, and a standup paddle boarding habit, this may be your favorite store. However, for those of us who merely entertain a seasonal interest in the outdoors, this place wasnt up to par.nnConsidering the price point and specialized nature of the products in this store, I expected more in the way of customer service. As in I expected to get some in general but received none. I love combining hiking with water, and was looking into whether it would be worth it to buy my own kayak.nnHung around the kayak section for nearly a halfhour, checked out prices, looked at straps to transport it, but was never asked if I needed help or had any questions. Kayaks, for those of us who didnt know, are generally about  here while standup paddleboards will apparently run you into the quadruple digits. Again, with prices like that, I shouldnt have to wonder if I can transport such a purchase on my own car, someone should have that info and be interested in sharing it with me.nnDid my own research here, and Ill likely continue to rent as needed rather than purchase, but even if I changed my mind I wouldnt be inclined to bring my business here."

0,"I did my research online because I am very particular about my hair stylist, and after reading reviews on Yelp, Google, and Facebook, I chose to have my haircut at The Edge by the owner, Rick, who alleges  years of experience. I figured having the owner cut my hair would leave me with a fresh, perfect cut, but my mistake was assuming that the owner of the salon knew what he was doing. nnRick was polite, of course, but his hair technique where he used texturizing scissors on the crown of my fine long hair after I repeatedly told him not to left my layers incredibly uneven on one side. Whenever I straightened my hair, the right side had uneven pieces that were cut straight across, like an upsidedown bar graph. nnHalfway through my haircut, Rick had another appointment and asked another stylist to finish blowdrying and styling my hair. For him, it meant less work and more paying clients for me, it meant having to tip for a single hair service twice. I wasnt going to leave the salon without tipping the poor hairstylist who was miserably blowdrying my hair. nnI recently went to Hair Do salon and had the most fantastic experience. My wonderful hairstylist was shocked to see how uneven my hair had grown out in just three months and how heavy he had left the bottom. The results of a haphazard, hurried haircut. nnThe Edge Salon might have some other great stylists, but the owner is not one of them. First and last time I visit this place."
0,"We went here for a late lunchearly dinner because Yamas down the street doesnt open until pm. First, the waiter snatched the paper sushi menu from right under my nose while I was reading it, so he could write my husbands order on it! We ordered the fried calamari as an appetizer it came out as  large  x  inch pieces!  So, we waited patiently and asked for appetizer plates and knives to cut it up into edible pieces, but after all the trouble the batter fell off and we were just left with the largest pieces of calamari Ive ever seen. My udon noodle soup was  broth and   udon noodles and was nothing special, and my husbands teriyaki chicken plate with fried rice was just okay. Tasted like mall food court foodwell maybe mall food is a little better"
0,"Its expensive, and in my opinion, not really worth the money.nnWe got the lobster mac n cheese, alcoholic tiramisu shake, funghi, and rising sun burger. nnThe lobster mac n cheese was good, with nice chunks of lobster and a creamy but still liquid pasta sauce and campanelle pasta! nice touch, but there was just so little of it. It came in the same small, shallow cast iron dish that their dips came in as we saw at the other table, and for a price of , too steep for my mac n cheese wallet.nnThe alcoholic tiramisu shake was not very noticeably alcoholic. And the shakes themselves are pretty much the same price as their burgers, but we just figured go big or go home. It was pretty delicious and a bit too sweet when it melted and tasted like liquefied tiramisu, which was the closest thing to refreshing when I got sick of all the savory orders.nnThe funghi was moderately disappointing, the notdisappointed side mainly because I was hungry.. It consisted of a beef patty, roasted portabello mushroom, carmelized onion, truffle oil, gruyere cheese, frisee as vegetation, and aioli...what type, Im not completely sure. It was ., pretty large and beefy, with a meaty portabello...but still, a bit bland for my palate...there wasnt much shazam in the burger, mushroom afficionado or not.nnThe rising sun burger was supposed to be the showstopper...the idea of it sounds absolutely ingenious, and I was initially very excited for it. Built of a Kobe beef patty, teriyaki glaze, nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo and tempura avocado, it sounds like someone took a delicious burger and prepared it with a Japanese pantry. And the individual points were all present with the burger, but I felt like the burger was overwhelming my salty and sweet taste buds. The teriyaki glaze was way too much, either too sweet and salty or too much sheer quantity for the burger. The nori furikake was actually kind of salty too, which disillusioned me from furikake for a while...the tempura avocado was soggy and the batter, too thick and not crispy. Which I guess happens when you deep fry and avocado and then stuff it between a huge slab of ground beef and a tower of toppings. After finishing it I felt the need to chug my glass of water...so the burger cost me  and an extra trip to the bathroom.nnIn foresight of these issues, we ordered two sides of raw onion...very nicely, thinly sliced, in a way that let it melt in your mouth so that you only tasted the sweetness of the onion, but yet it was a full indisputable bite of onion. Delectable. Those onions were a side dish to everything that night, they just seemed to make everything better.nnHolsteins is alright, you know? It really has some great concepts with the creative gourmet burgers and alcoholic milk shakes, but a little better execution would be valued. Id give it a .  . stars if I could, mostly due to the steep prices for what was a semidisappointing meal."
0,"The service was good, and by a stroke of luck we got a table for four right away at  oclock on a Friday night. But alas, I absolutely hate cilantro. I cannot stand it in any way. And everything they sell, except for the bean dip, has cilantro in it. Not one thing on the menu was sans cilantro, and the waitress said nothing could be made without it. So I basically ended up eating bean dip and chips for dinner. So, I cant say I enjoyed my experience there, and I definitely wont return. But if you like cilantro, then try it out!"

0,"Overpriced, tasteless food. expensive salads and then they nickel and dime you for extra toppings not just meat but also avocados, figs, etc. The red lentil soup was somehow spicy and flavorless all at the same time.

0,"Ive always wanted to try the Farmhouse since Ive heard it is so wonderful and it looks so cute. I went this morning with my friend and of course it was packed. We opted for a sunny seat on the patio rather than waiting for an inside seat even though it was a cold January morning.  I think that may have been our biggest mistake.  After we got our coffee,  it took a full  minutes for our not so friendly waitress to take our order. When we finally did get our order, we had to request coffee refills and ask for pancake syrup.  It got to the point where we felt like we were an inconvenience to our waitress. We were not impressed and the food wasnt worth going back for."
0,"Wow...and I dont mean that in a good way! Its hard for me to write a review about a business like this as my experiences are typically not this bad, but here we go My first review that is really bad. I visited this Chilis today because I had a couple of gift cards received from the holidays and lunch was still marinating at home. I previously heard that they had a menu of  calorie meals. Im not really a calorie counter, but Im definitely health conscious and I looked at what the offerings were from the website and was impressed by their  calorie meals. They seemed really appetizing and filling and for the most part used unprocessed, unrefined ingredients. nnWell, I arrived for lunch as aforementioned and there was no greeter. Okay...thats fine. I just waited a little. It gave me time to view the interior to get a feel for it before I go any further. I didnt like the environment. It was really dark a lot of that of course had to do with the cloudy weather we had today. This was lunch time though and I wasnt looking for any mood lighting. The next thing I didnt like was that it felt like a bar. Now I know this wasnt a fancy restaurant, but I didnt come here to be at a bar! So minutes passed and I was getting incredibly impatient because there was still no greeter to offer me a seat. Was I free to sit anywhere I want? Defintely, NO! I was about to leave, but my companion didnt want to go and walked a little further into the restaurant to look for a server. I was facing the door at this point and someone near the bar area asked if someone was helping us. Of course, NO! We were seated. I agreed with the first seat we were offered, but after sitting there for a few seconds I realized it was just too dark. I asked if it was okay to sit by the window and was allowed to sit elsewhere. nnAlas, I sat down again and looked through the menu. Where is the  calorie meals? I dont see it on the menu or anywhere on display at the table. I looked through the menu to see if there was anything at all that I could replace that whole idea with and the answer was NO! I wonder if the  calorie meals were only offered for dinner. I dont know. I didnt bother to ask either so I just walked out.nnI assume this Chilis isnt always a bad deal and bad expierience, but I have to rate this visit according to my experience. ONE STAR!!! Hey, Chilis at Shea, it hurts me as much as it hurts you."
0,"Visited the newest Jimmy Johns in our area on Sunday afternoon. The place still has that new store feel its so squeaky clean, but what made it really seem like a brand new Jimmy Johns was the lack of experience from the people behind the counter.nnMy husband ordered a  and asked for hot peppers as well. This completely flummoxed the young woman working the register, but after a couple of confused looks one of the guys making a sandwich said something to her and she put the order in.nnNext up, I ordered a , also with hot peppers. She repeated my order back to me, even as she got it wrong on the register.nnMy husband received his sandwich with maybe  hot peppers on it. My sandwich had none, and the receipt showed she didnt include it when she rang us up.nnEverything about the people working there just screams NEW!!!! right now. I had to ask her to give me a cup for the drink I ordered after she just turned away from us to help the next customer. The wait for our sandwiches wasnt long but it was comical watching the guy behind the counter reposition each of our sandwiches several times, moving it by millimeters precisely before wrapping it.nnThis was the worst experience weve had at Jimmy Johns. Ive never had them get my order wrong before. It wasnt a TERRIBLE experience in the grand scheme of things, but its definitely below the standards Ive seen in their Pineville store. Ill give this new location another chance, but not for another month or two so the staff gets a chance to learn how to ring up orders correctly."
0,"The waffles were great but the customer service was awful. It was so bad I literally just made an account just to share how off putting our experience was. My girlfriend and I walked in and stood in line reading the menu for a few minutes trying to decide on what to order. The guy working there was staring daggers at us for some reason, in between him texting on his phone, though it seemed obvious we were not familiar with the place. I asked for two Waffallonia which was a waffle with unlimited toppings. I told him I wanted every topping listed on the menu above the Waffllonia and he wrote down that we both wanted the same thing before my girlfriend even had a chance to decide. After she asked him politely for no bananas, a different ice cream and no chocolate drizzle he huffed and puffed as if she asked him to sacrifice his first born child. Somehow he still managed to screw up our order. He gave us both the same ice cream, I could see that he realized immediately that he screwed up but apparently he didnt care enough to do or say anything to us up front. In addition, or subtraction really, he didnt put either whipped cream or chocolate drizzle on mine as well.  He just shoved our orders back to us and he seemed to just want us out of there. I just wanted to get away from that place as well. I dont think Im ever going to go back if that jerk still works there. Its not worth the time or money to put up with that type of treatment. If possible Id give them  stars but the waffle was good so  seems appropriate."

When we purchased our tickets on line, it stated  of your group needed to be there before you were seated. Ok.  No problem.  But when  of our  showed up, the young girl up front was very rude and said she would not seat us.  That we all had to be there.  We pulled out our ticket with the  verbiage clearly printed, and the other girl up front said in a very snotty tone, Ugh.  Go ahead and seat them.  Like they were doing us the favor.  Really?  You honestly need to get new employees to work your door.  The waitress, well, she was the best thing of the night, next to the comedians.  Very nice.  Pretty attentive.  What was annoying was the fact they do not print the drink prices on the menu.  Of course, we are all adult enough to ask before ordering, but were shocked to hear some of the special mixed drinks were .each.  And the bottled water was .  I splurged and got one of the . specials, and it was terrible.  Very small and not even mixed well.  All  people in our party complained after the show of the lack of quality drinks.  We have been to many other comedy clubs throughout the years, and this place just doesnt hold up against the others.  Crampedawkward seating.  Very hot in there.  Terrible acoustics we were seated along the wall and the view was kind of awkward too.  Terrible drinks.  Rude staff at the door.  The comedians and waitress were really the saving factors for the evening.  It really could be a fun place to go, but until some improvements are made, I doubt we will be going back any time soon."

0,"I am not typically one to write bad reviews unless a place is down right horrible. I prefer to praise establishments that really tickle my fancy. Tonight though as I sat for nearly an hour without a drink refill, I decided that I was going to break my own personal rule for review writing on yelp. nnI went to Diablos tonight to celebrate a friends birthday. Our table wasnt ready yet so we went upstairs to get a drink and listen to some music. Two Dos Equis beers and a Diet Coke came to a whopping total of . I decided to let this slide as I was reminded that We are on The Strip. To make matters worse, there was an almost unbearable stench.nnThey were finally ready for our group so we went downstairs to our table. We were five seats and several menus short for our group. Instead of bringing over another table, they graciously There really should be a sarcasm font. brought over additional seats, but no menus. As our very large group crammed into the tables, the birthday girl was left sharing the head of the table with  other people. When our server came over to take our drink order, we asked if we could add another table to our group to make room for everyone. I am sure about  managers had to be contacted to make this happen, but in the end we got our wish... That was about to be the extent of anything resembling customer service for the remainder of the evening. nnHeres the bottom linenThe food was mediocre at best.nThe Jalapeno Chicken Tacos were bland. The Skirt Steak Nachos were just okay. The only flavor the steak had was the taste of the charred bits off the grill. The  guacamole looked like a huge serving, but was really a much smaller serving atop several crushed tortilla chips. Chips and salsa are not complimentary, but rather an extra . The salsa was boring and really nothing to write home about. Lastly, the refried beans tasted like what I imagine Meow Mix must taste like.nThe service was PATHETIC.nWe were only brought water refills after someone at our table finally had to ASK for it. Other beverages, such as soft drinks, were NEVER refilled. At one point in time, after being asked to bring refills, our server even came by with the water pitcher, but turned around to chat with a friend. When she was finally able to honor our request, she got distracted and only ended up refilling half of the water glasses at our table. She also never bothered asking any of us if we wanted another round of drinks or boxes for leftovers. Empty plates sat on the table for nearly an hour after we had finished eating. Out of frustration, we decided to look up some other reviews. Not surprisingly one of the first reviews we saw stated that the manager lacked a sense of responsibility or urgency when approached about other times when service was less than stellar. The worst part of all is that because our party was so large, we had no choice but to pay the  gratuity automatically added to our bill.nnI will NEVER return to Diablos Cantina. They should be ashamed of both the lack of customer service as well as the lack of quality of the food they present to their customers. Unfortunately, I think this place is a perfect example of what happens when a business on The Strip forgoes attention to the quality of their product in an effort to just get as many tourists in and out the door as possible. They certainly are not looking for repeat customers or to impress locals who may return for a good time. It is sad that a restaurant like this will most likely stay in business simply because of their curb appeal."
0,"A very disappointing experience.  I am sure FAR does very good work and thank God we have people who care about lost, unloved pets, but people skills are as important as animal!  We stopped at the Pima Road facility as we were on our way down to a pet adoption event taking place down at one of the pets stores.  It was hard to find the adoption office and when we found it, there was no one there.  We waited about  or eight minutes, then thought maybe we were in the wrong place, so we went back out.  There was a fenced in area with someone obviously involved with FAR and two potential pet parents and the adoptee.  Politely, we stood about  feet away from the enclosure so as not to impose or distract the dog while his future people got to know him.  After a few minutes, the FAR lady looked up and virtually growled at us too much time with the pups? Is something wrong?  Her tone and demeanor was very aggressive and unfriendly.  My husband told her there was nothing wrong, that we were hoping to adopt a young dog and had stopped in to see their rescues.  The FAR woman said, If you want a puppy, we dont have any, and then turned back to the other people.  Ummmwe said young dog, not puppy, but frankly, we want our pet adoption to be fun and with people who share our excitement in adding a new member of the family.  This woman was not that person.  We certainly dont complain about an interviewing process that matches the right pet to the right family or fees that help support the shelter, but I draw the line at outright rudeness.  I expect better manners from my dog!  She could have at least smiled orif she was feeling overworked, had just said someone will be with you in a moment.  nnOur search for The Queen continues, but it wont be at FAR."

That shouldnt take too long..its on the appetizer menu, so at most.... mins.nAbout  mins later, I still couldnt get our bartenders attention for drink refills or to inquire on the delay in our food, so I started talking loudly about not getting to eat.  Finally, the other bartender stopped by to say Wow, it sure is taking a long time to get your bruschetta.  Um, yes....so get someone to go check on it please?  At that point, the chic interested in her appearance decided she should probably go see what was taking so long.  She disappeared to the kitchen, and I got hopeful about eating.  A few mins later she reappeared, but only to continue checking out her reflection in chrome and chatting with her coworkers.  Another conversation with me and the other bartender began and went along these lines should bruschetta take  mins? I mean its just toppings  toast.  I really would like to eat.  I ordered and appetizer, because I didnt have all night to wait for food.  Her response was something like I guess there was a problem in the kitchen, and the guy making appetizers got hurt, so that throws everything out of ordernnummm, ok.  But i have worked in enough restaurants, so you cant tell me that there isnt anyone capable of putting some meat on toast?nnSo... finally the manager arrives with the bruschetta, his apologies, and the comment that its on the house.  Yes, it should be.  When I asked as to the delay, the manager said the person making appetizers cut himself very badly and that caused the delay.nnWhile I am truly sorry someone cut themselves, and I hope it wasnt serious, I still have to ask... nwas there no one in the kitchen capable of making bruschetta?nand what about the crappy bar service, while sitting at the bar?nand why did I have to ask about my food, why wasnt the bartender all over that?neven if you had to throw away all the ingredients and start from scratch, you think you could have told me that, rather than ignoring me for  mins?nnnSo here is the deal La Bocca.

The drinks were very good, nice selection of Champagnes and beers.  My big issues stem from a very bad waiter and a menu that wasnt updated.nnI ordered the Charcuterie, which included torchon foie gras and duck rillettes.  When it came out it had neither of the items I was excited about.  It had some spicy sausage and some prosciutto and fresh tuna salad not a joke.  When I asked the waiter about it he had no apologies and just asked if I wanted him to take it away. several stars off for that.  One of my friends ordered the Croque Monsieur a fav of mine which was ok, but not quite good.  It seemed as if it was made by a staff member instead of a chef who knew what he was doing.  Another friend ordered the Pulled Pork Quesadilla which wasnt exactly as described in the menu either, but not bad.nnThe waiter came by several times to check on our drinks, etc but twice he came over to the table with his arms crossed a huge nono with me.  Plus, the waiter asked for a card to run a tab for our table?  even bigger turn off.nnOverall I thought this place had great potential but its execution was way under par.

0,"I cant say this was a bad experience, it just could have been better with a few simple considerations.  First off, Im tall, so when my therapist did nothing to adjust the chair for my height, I felt cramped and hunched as opposed to open and relaxed.  I knew this would likely cause discomfort during the deeper portions of the session.  I was right.  Secondly, there was no personal communication whatsoever.  The best bodywork is targeted to specific problem areas, and my therapist neither asked me about what I wanted him to focus on, nor checked in with me about how I was feeling during or afterwards.  Finally, when I took out my wallet to pay, I handed him my credit card.  He saw that I had cash in my wallet, and kept pointing to the wallet, as if he would prefer that I pay cash.  I felt like this was a bit rude or presumptious of him, and I insisted on paying with the card.

The CGI version of that fight scene at the end was a big disappointment  especially for keeping the show at full price. nnI felt let down at the end."
0,"Good place to see a lot of KISS memorabilia and hear some good music, but for us, that was about it.  Mini golf was lame but I did beat my golfer boyfriend by one stroke, there is a small arcade area which we arent interested in, and a wedding chapel if thats your thing. nnThe staff were great though!  Very fun and attentive.  We are glad we went and suggested to our friends to go at least once,. but we probably wont go back."
0,"So my one star could go to  or  stars if they can get my CC info corrected. Overall I am not sure if the wait, lack of service, and time it takes to and from is worth saving  while on business. nnIf I was on vacation with my family and had no place to go or be, then this might be a great place to rent a car. The over tones from other people were not good. nnThe wait at the counter,  HOUR and yes I had already made a prepaid reservation. nThe car was fine smelled like smoke. nDrop off was okay, i asked to have my cc changed, and I think that is where the issue lies."
0,"The building is adorable, brick wall warehouse feel. Complimentary valet is also nice. OH  they gave me my beer in a paper bag, hood style, which was pretty cool.nnAs far as the food, I should have just ordered appetizers because my meal was horrible!nnAppetizers included fried pickles, fried green tomatoes,  fried corn fritters.

0,"eh...is it just me? or is this place just all hype?nnFirst of all, waiting for over an hour for breakfast was NOT so fun...but hey...if its good, then Ill wait.nnSo was it worth the wait? NOPE!  This place serves soso breakfast with facadely big portions on the pricey side.  I was just glad to get some food in my tummy.  I ordered the salmon hash plate, which was ok.  I tried my friends chorizo hash plate with was much better.  The chorizo was spicy and delicious.  The sage fried chicken was forgettable.nnOne thing, dont think you can go there and not order and just share.  You have to order something.  I forgot what the minimum was.  My mom ordered Latte and still had to order something else.  SO BEWARE!"
0,"My review is NOT about Home Depot so much as the Hampton Bay products that they carry.  I bought a  light bathroom fixture and of course while putting it up broke one of the globes.  Went to get another globe and guess what?  They dont carry them.  Went to all the stores in Las Vegas except one and got the same thing.  Given a Hampton Bay website and phone  and was told on the phone that even they couldnt get replacements from CHINA!  Well, needless to say, Im out . for the fixture and have to purchase another one.nDO NOT BUY HAMPTON BAY LIGHTING!  nCharles Abinante"
0,"Went there yesterday for lunch.nNot at all impressed with the food.  Portions were very small.  I am a small eater and ususally get filled up quickly.  But I left there yesterday still a bit hungry.  Nice salad of lettuce and strips of poultry.  Our menu said there were meatballs being served.  The meatballs consisted of just a couple bowls of them on a table which probably sat  people.  They were bite sized and most people got just  and some did not get any.  We were waiting for them to bring more out but instead they came back with the dessert.  A tiny, probably . inch square of red devil sponge cake.  No soft drinks, etc, only water was served.  I had been considering to go back some day for HH but at the size of servings I would probably have to order  of the HH menu.nI had hoped that I would really like this place, but alas no."
0,"I wont be kneading this place again... It sounded good, but the sandwiches where pretty disappointing. I got the turkey and cranberry croissant. It was rather bland and lacked the gusto that the picture showed. Oh well. The staff seemed pretty nice though. Im not mad I tried it, I just probably wont be coming back."
0,"Not Calified. If you are really hungry then go for it but dont expect to be compensated for bringing wheat instead of rye, over well means overwell, not runny. It took three times and the same number of servers communication? . Waiting on eggs to come back for over  minutes only to hear, no one told me from our waitress. Ok, Im done. But no, there is more. Wait for it... no really wait for it because we had to ask for our soda refill as it was simply forgotten. She said it was a bad day maybe only for her, it happens but when we got our bill, no apology and no come back on a better day discount. Keep in mind, that a glass of milk cost more than a gallon .."
0,"Caesars Palace fails to deliver as one of the top rated hotels in Las Vegas, Nevada when Lago Buffet was sheepishly introduced as a cutdown offering to those who seek the best in buffets.nnOverheard in the Rewards Center from the employees is the hype that the food quality is up there but the variety is very small.  Unfortunately, the food preparation compares to that of a Dennys Restaurant at Bellagio prices!  Even the servers and employees are embarrassed to recommend Lago Cafe.nnPricing is about  per person for breakfast with  different entrees. Scrambled eggs, hash browns,  types of sliced bread, two types of sausages, carved chicken, ham and roast beef, biscuits and gravy and finally mashed potatoes.  Of course there are coffee, orange juice with more arsenic and cranberry juice.nnFor lunch, add  more and get skinny king crab legs that are cured in salt water and washed out shrimp.  Lots of cheap pasta.  For kosher folks, you get slimy salmon and suspiciously low grade beef that may not be kosher.nnAnyone who endorses Caesars Lago Buffet has to be stupid because there are far better spreads with first rate chefs that runs circles around this over rated scam.nnWhich ones?  I mentioned it. Bellagio.  For around  including tax, you get over  times the entrees that actually taste like a cuisine. Unlike Lago, Bellagio actually has pride in their presentation and flavors.  Each taste, each morsel is filled with surprising good flavors and desserts! Lets talk desserts.  Lago presents crummy cookies and questionable donuts that are laughably small.  Bellagio? WOW!nnCaesars Palace Buffet Lago can be best described as disappointing and a waste of money.  People who praise Lago are simply not smart or have common sense. When employees in private dont recommend Lago, then that says a lot about why you should go elsewhere.nnCaesars Palace Buffet Lago food can be best compared to Sunset Stations Buffet.  Food is OK quality. The only difference is that Sunset Station charges  versus  for a lot less variety of food."
0,"Just as the rating says, I have experienced better. However, I did have a cocktail here  for a change, and it was delicious. The staff is very nice and kind, however even though my friend rants and raves about how awesome this place is, and how often he goes, I wish I had just stayed home and had two shots here. Not worth the price, trip, and no point in being social. The customers are regulars, and people that live around me, but they get antsy if you sit in their spot or play a game of pool. The food takes quite a bit of time to come out, too, which isnt so bad since thats not really the point of going to a restaurant. More holeinthewall than anything. Wont be returning without peer pressure."
0,"I am reviewing this specific location and not the chain in general.  Really, do not waste your time going here and just go to another location for your Taco Bell needs.  nnAs any TB frequenter knows, there are some of those visits during off peak hours where they have their JV folders on duty and the result is your food is just not put together well.  This location seems to only hire JV folders.  nnAnother thing that is upsetting about this location is that their rate of getting orders correct is at best  in .  They constantly put beef on my bean burritos and put onions on the  layers.  nnIf you enjoy interaction with crack heads, then this place is for you.  I have gotten harassed by other patrons who just yelled random comments at us, and this was during the day.  Also, one of the workers was definitely under the influence during one visit.  nnJust drive the extra  minutes and go to another location."
0,"If youve been to a Vegas buffet this is nothing near it. First impression when I came in on a Tuesday night wow ghettttooooo! Ive been to many buffets, but the food didnt look appetizing at all. I went for a plate and there were a piece of chocolate cake still stuck on it. Im not normally a germaphobe but that made me check twice on the cutlery. It was soooo busy and packed, it seemed like a refugee camps cafeteria where people havent eaten before. nnGood n good variety for what u pay forn cotton candyn Chocolate fonduennWould I recommend waiting in a long ass line? No way. But again, good value for the money steak dry medium rare, ribsdry, ham dry, spinach n salad bar fresh. Dessert omg super sweet."
0,"I had dinner here with three coworkers last Wednesday night . The ambiance was nice and the wait staff very friendly and efficient. We ordered the family style dining option and the appetizers were excellent. We have the Mozzarella Marinara, Spinach  Artichoke al Forno, Garlic Bread Focaccia, and Italian Tossed salad. For dinner we ordered Gnocchi  Italian Sausage, FourCheese Ravioli, Baked Rigatoni Pomodoro, and Braised Beef Ravioli. The main dishes were overly sauced and the pasta was over cooked. I could not even eat the gnocchi...it was like eating balls of paste.nnThis restaurant is highly rated by many on Yelp so it is possible we were just there on a bad night but I will find it hard to return after my last experience. I dont think that anyone in my group was terribly impressed."

0,"Hands down, probably the worst buffet that Ive ever been to. Terrible seating  every time someone walks by you, they brush up against you. Its like eating on a crowded bus. Why people continue to come here is beyond me. There are better choices all over Vegas. Prime Rib? How about subprime? The meat was so tough that I thought I was chewing beef jerky. They need some kind of quality control here. The food looked like it was thrown together by a year old. If I ever come here again, it will probably be because I am drunk and dont know where I am."
0,"Well, caveat emptor with this place.  I had the GroupOn so I made my reservation on  a day that it was about  degrees in Pittsburgh.  I called and gave my name and phone number.  This is why I was surprised when I got there to learn that the air condition had broken  they didnt even think to call and tell me.  I decided to perservere and took a seat outside with my friend.  While the initial waiter was friendly, I had to wave down the other waiter that continued to walk by and completely ignore us.  nWe ordered the rabbit as an appetizer.  The waiter set it down and left.  They forgot to serve it with the crustini  so what we had was a plate of a rabbit patte with nothing to scoop onto.  Disaster and not good.nFor dinner my friend and I both ordered the beet salad.  While it was very tasty, the portion size equaled approximately half a cup.  For  it was a rip off.nThe grand finale was when the bill arrived and I was given a leaky pen that exploded all over my dress and hands.  While the waiter was kind and got me soda water there was no offer for dry cleaning nor to take any money off our bill.  nI would not return here.  Id also be amazed if it is there in six months given all the terrible reviews.  Too bad, its a great location with a lot of potential."

Only time it seems to not be extremely busy is at am.  nnAlso signed up for their  dollar month to avoid paying the  dollar sign up fee for the  dollars a month and  months after signing up they charged my bank account  dollars for two different accounts we have there.  NEVER was this told to me that they would be taking additional money out or anything.  nnI asked about classes and they told me not to bother because they are always packed and my best bet would be to come in at am to workout.  nnMonthly price is good, but not if you can never get a machine...you get tired of waiting around.  Seriously needs to expand to rest of building or move to a larger independent building."
0,"This place is very full of itself.  That being the short of it.  Do they have many kitchen thingamajigees you may find interesting?  Sure, you betcha!  Do they charge an inflationary price you may have guessed given the French title and locations in Kierland Commons and Fashion Square?  Right again!  Either of those would be permissible were it not for being so WalMartish  in their knowledge of their own stock.  Ack.nnOne day I was looking for a channel knife.  After much hunting a shop keeper suggested checking out Sur La Table.  Their website said they stocked the item I was looking for.  I called before heading out to be assured they were in stock, yay!  I get to Sur La Table only to be shuffled through various staff who either didnt know what a channel knife is or didnt know where to find one in the store.  Eventually a kind man looked it up on the net as I had, which showed their location had them on hand although no one could find them.  He called the Kierland store which showed them in stock as well and called to make sure before sending me further afield.nnWhoa is I!  After being put on hold for ages I surmise I could get to Kierland faster than his associates at the other store would answer his query.  Asking that should anyone pickup, I want the knife held aside for me, I take off again.  Arriving at the Kierland store I am met with long lines and lack of staff.  Eventually I get a staff member who knows who I am  and presents me with TADA! an item that is not a channel knife which has been put aside for me.  Durrr.nnAfter sifting through displays I find my knife, which is not on the properly tagged shelf but a match to the internet item.  Sheesh.  I appreciate that Sur La Table was the only place in the valley I found a channel knife but why did it have to be so HARD?"
0,Has lunch there yesterday was very disappointed.  The server was not very helpful at all.  The food looked like it was warmed up in the mico no flavor at all.  The salad bar the tomatoes was old looking and everything looked old been sitting there for hours. sorry will not be back again
0,"We tried this restaurant on a busy Saturday for lunch.  It should have been a clue to us that all the surrounding restaurants were packed, but Wok Box had no wait at all.  Our three dishes came out indistinguishable from one another.  It took us a few bites and switching plates to figure out whose was whose.  The flavor on all three were bland.  My sister ended up with paper packet pieces in hers.  The staff apologized and acknowledged it was a wrapper that ended up in her dish.  They gave us the money back for hers.  Overall the staff was friendly, but the food was not good at all."
0,"i dont know what happened to this place....and honestly this is my first  star...but this made me sad  horrible horrible service.  And i dont think the waiter was having an off day that made him ignore us, because he chatted up every other table he was helping.  He forgot my friends drink, while he brought st and nd drinks and their food.  Umm they were even seated before we ordered, so....and then when we left and they surprisingly brought our food out, i could tell it was had been sittin wherever forever because the gravy on my poutine had that dry gelled gravy look on it i wanted to cry the manager tried to say he just forgot about us and it was an off night.  But the tables on the inside were EMPTY O.o....yeah ok im good  ILL MISS YOU ENGLISHS"
0,"I am not happy here. Staff is very disorganized and irresponsible. They misplaced my rent check and tried to charge me .. When I went into the office to straighten things out, my check was on their desk. No apology was made to me for their mistakes or the inconveniences they caused me. They are great at leaving nasty little notes that are completely uncalled for, and apparently their rules dont apply to everyone. They are so unprofessional. I would never recommend Viviani to anyone."
0,"This is the first time I have had the worst service at Canes!!! We go to Canes one or two time a month. We love the place. The employee are always up beat, good service!!! NOT THIS TIME!!! The drive thru was so long so i went in side. Was that the worst mistake I did. The girl Monique ,  pm that took my order acted like she did not want to be there  all the employee acted that way, rude, got my order wrong, did not ask me anything  if i want Lemonade, I usually go through the drive thru i had a Buy a box and get free box combo on my Canes card. I order a Box and a Caniac Combo. I thought i could order a Caniac and a Box because Caniac is more money. Not this case! She called the manager over to fix it and she told him wrong thing about the order. So I paid for two combos and got the Box combo for free. I only needed two combs. The manger also acted like I was putting him out to fix the order. Then i went to get the drinks, there was no lemonade so the manager was at the counter i ask if i could get a lemonade, he said to me that is usually it a up charge, he gave it to me any ways. I could not wait to get out of there i was so upset! BAD CANE BAD BOY!!!! I think you need to do some new training with your employees."
0,"THIS PLACE IS ONE HUGE SCAMnnI am so unbelievably disappointed with my experience here. It has been nothing but a huge nightmare.nnThey have made empty promises to me over and over from day one.nnIf you care to read on as to WHY this was such a horrible experience, here is my email to the gyms manager, BriannnHi Brian,nnI have been having a complete nightmare of an experience with your gym as of late. I spoke with Stacy today and she told me that it would be best to come down and meet with you on Monday or Tuesday and that I should let you know what is going on.nnBack in June I came into Golds Gym and was interested in a membership. Danny was the one helping me out and telling me what memberships were available. I explained to him that I was under a pretty strict budget and would definitely not be able to commit to a year long contract as there was a good chance Id be moving. So, he told me that what he could do for me was that as long as my first  payments so my first month went through no problem which it did that my contract would turn into a month to month contract. He took my credit card info and THEN proceeded to tell me the rules of the gym one of which included a rate lockin fee. I immediately said there was no way I was going to agree to this and that it was NOT okay that he brought this up AFTER taking my credit card info. I told him it was a deal breaker and I was ready to walk out. He then said he would be able to waive that fee for me no problem if I would sign up. He then said he would get in contact with corporate and get the whole month to month thing taken care of and then he would send me some sort of confirmation email regarding this. I never received one. I suppose this was the first sign that it was a lie. Come August, I receive word that the owner of the home I was renting was selling it so we were being forced to move. So in September I called in to cancel my membership. I was told that I would need to call corporate but they told me I was still in a  month contract and would need to speak with the salesman that set me up. I finally get a hold of Danny and he appears to remember me and says it will be no problem to get my membership cancelled. Even though Im pretty angry that he had lied to me, I was happy that it was supposedly going to get taken care of. Then in October I see that my account was charged . and am pretty outraged that this large amount got deducted when I thought my account was cancelled. I called to speak with Danny and he explains to me that this was the rate lockin fee that he had told me he was going to waive!! Not only this, but had he cancelled my account when he said he would, I never would have gotten this charge in the first place! So Ive been speaking with Danny almost every day, hearing his promise of getting my money refunded the portion that does not include my last  weeks payment over and over and over. He said it would ABSOLUTELY be in my account today at am. Of course, it was not. Again. And THEN, when speaking with Stacy today, I find out that my account is still open. WHAT?!nnBrian, there are so, so many problems with what is going on here. I am not sure if this is one huge lie or simply incompetence. I have never, ever had a worse experience with a gym than this. In fact, I have never had a worse experience with any company. nnIn speaking with Danny, he does not at all deny the fact that he made these promises. If he tells you otherwise, perhaps you can refer to phone call recordings and hear how many times he says he is not sure what happened and has assured me that everything would be taken care of. This man remembers every single persons name in the gym and I guarantee that he remembers these false promises he made me. nnI am not pleased that I will have to drive from Tempe to downtown Phoenix in rush hour traffic immediately after work but if that is what I need to do to get this taken care of, I will. nnStacy mentioned that you were sick so please let me know what day will work for you to meet. I will be off work by  so I will probably be able to get there by  or pm on Monday or Tuesday.nnThank you."
0,"Wow, I am sorely disappointed with this restaurant. Not one good entree was eaten here. All mediocre to downright terrible. Even the bread sucked, tasted like a doughy dry mess from Costco or something. I could barely stomach it. I ordered the vegetarian menu and it blew. First of all, every dish had something fried in it that didnt belong in there. The heirloom tomato salad had this giant oily, overfried mess they called a crouton baguette. Omg, I get this giant oily mess swimming in a shallow layer of tomato sauce that tasted like Ragu but was supposed to be gazpacho. Seriously? Then I have the sauteed fava beans in pea puree. Not bad, actually and truly on par with your top most favorite baby foods. And thrown in were these fried cauliflowers that really added nothing special to my baby food. Then came the butternut squash ravioli which were completely dried out and filled with downright butternut squash and nothing else. It was the blandest most dried out pasta I have ever eaten. No brown butter or sage to speak of. I mean, what the hell? The vegetable ragout was awful with these huge bland watery beets that tasted boiled or oversteamed, and was swimming in sauce that tasted like ragu yet again! boy, this must be Chef Serranos favorite goto brand! Other standouts for worst dish ever was the dessert, the hazelnut joconde. Dear god, Ive never had such a dry cake in my life. It was layers of sawdust in between decent chocolate mousse. And it was served dead cold. I felt like I got one of those cakes from the frozen aisle but no one bothered to defrost it at all. My husbands degustation menu wasnt any better and I will spare you the details but it was equally unremarkable to downright bad. The main lobster salad was bland. The scallop was decent.  He said his foie gras was overcooked at the edges but the middle was edible. The loin of colorado lamb was overcooked  he asked for medium rare and got mediumwell. And it was a tiny piece of meat too  how do you get this wrong???  His Chai Tea Poached Pear was actually pretty good. The ice cream wasnt overpowering and the poached pears were delicious. But for spending over , I feel robbed. I feel like I gambled and lost big time playing with the food roulette wheel of Vegas. Chef Serrano was either asleep or not there when we dined. Thanks for making me feel like you stole my money."
0,"The interior design of this place is actually really nice, very modern and cute which I can appreciate. But I was very disappointed with the rest of my experience, despite the fact that a lot of my coworkers and friends come here often. The employees were not friendly and rushed me to choose my color. The top coat they use for pedicures is a quick drying nail polish that I buy from target, so I dont feel like it was worth the over pricing they charge. I got a regular manicure and it instantly started to crack when they were finished. I had never experienced this before. I brought this to his attention and he said there was nothing he could do about it. I was pretty disappointed. nnThe one thing I will say is that if you bring them a picture of a nail design, they will do it to their best ability which is pretty cool, but other than that I do not recommend this place, especially for how expensive it is compared to the quality of service and outcome."

0,"This place is a piece of Las Vegas history.  You could spend hours looking at all the photos plastered all over the wall of famous and semifamous people that ate there throughout the years.  The atmosphere is sort of romantic and casual depending on where they seat you.  The menu is on every wall and is all inclusive.  So what ever meal you order  it includes soup or salad, garlic bread, entree, cappuccino and all the free wine you can drink redwhite.  One word of caution on the wine if you love and know good wines, this stuff is not that.  It is the cheapest stuff youll ever choke down.  Ive have the veal in the past and the spaghetti with sausage which are ok at best.  Ive spent a lot less and had much better food at other places like The Olive Garden. The only reason Ive been here several times is because my wife loves it.  If it wasnt for her I would not be back!"

0,"Not impressed. The pizza was average at best. When I introduced myself to the hostess that i was there for a to go, she was very unwelcoming and in a patronizing way pointed at the bar.  Not that I expected an as kissing, but a certain level of respect would be nice. If I was the manager I would stuff her in the kitchen and make her do dishes, until she gets fed up and quits. Then she can be a sour pus and bring down the next place of business."
0,Whats the hype all about?! I can find you a loungey modern club like this in any North American city with a population over K. nnOoohhh what a view....if you want a great view pay for the small upgrade to a higher floor in your hotel. nnGreat club if it were in any other city but I expect more in Vegas.
0,well i have to say i gave this place  shots and i will never teturn a third time.  The store on windmill is usually dirty and when eating in with another person you get your food at different times.  nothing like eating with a friend with nothing in front of them.  Then go to their website and try and find hours of operation......NONE.... When i called to find out i was so surprised nobody answered the phone and the voice mail box was full...never again...  Oh and BTW the tarter sauce is the worst i was even willing to stop and get some at smiths.
0,"When pulling up to this restaurant I had a great feeling. Such a pretty setting.... And that was the best thing I experienced here. The staff was rude and the food was not worth the price. It started with the host telling us that the patio was closed, even though we called at  earlier to verify we could have patio seating at . Did I mention that it is march in Phoenix and  degrees. Reluctantly, we were sat on the patio but the server made sure we paid for his inconvenience. He had to open an extra door. Every question or request was met with a snappy comment. We end up asking for a new server and the manager was mildly sympathetic. We would have left right away if we were not with other dinner guests and very hungry. They brought one of our guests the wrong meal and the food was good but not great. Over priced in my opinion. That being said the discounted our . bill by . I dont plan to go back anytime soon. If you choose to go here, good luck."
0,"Another overhyped bar from the owner of Mint and HiFi. You would think after so many years this people learned how to build a nice bar which will last for years. It is your typical bar with bouncers at the door which controls the capacity in this place. In other words keeps people waiting and lets only those whom they know or willing to pay. As soon as you enter there is a huge bar in front of you with unfriendly bartenders whom takes forever to take orders and deliver them it. Besides, on busy nights it is impossible to walk around bar due to lack of space. nnCrowd? Your typical Scottsdale crowd which bounces between El Hefe, Hi Fi and Fire House. There are some nice people but douchy guys all droid up walking around trying to get laid with brainless girls with daddy issues are common at this place. nnFood? It would be the last place I would go for food. nnDrinks?  dollar for a beer  nAnd cocktails it all depends what you want but be prepared to pay between . nnIt is advertised as beer garden but lacks majority beers."
0,"It was with much excitement that I stopped in today, their first day of business.  The store is beautiful, as one would expect.  Clean, bright, and plenty of almost eerily happy and helpful staff.  I expect this will all go downhill over time, but for now its very impressive.nnUnfortunately, by the time I left I felt pretty crestfallen that the Meijer I had been so looking forward to isnt going to become a regular stop for me. The main reason for this is because the store is incredibly poorly laid out.   The sections people visit on a typical grocery shopping trip are separated as much as possible, forcing customers to cut through all the home decor, clothes, automotive crap, and the like Im guessing for the purposes of encouraging unnecessary impulse buys.  Going to Meijer for groceries on a Saturday is enough of a pain in the ass without having to cover every single square inch of the store to get the stuff I need.  Forget a quick trip in to grab a few items for dinner, its just not possible.  Its so obnoxious that I cant see myself making a lot of grocery trips here since I just dont have the time or patience for a sight seeing tour of every last thing big box retail has to offer.nnThe other major issue I had was that the selection was surprisingly limited.  Their organic produce offerings are negligable.  I went in to pick up four particular, and not at all unusual, items and they only had two of them.  It really sucked to hike all over the store for almost  minutes looking for what I needed only to find that they didnt have half of it.  Whats the point of dealing with a monster store when youre going to have to make a second stop at County Market or Schnucks to finish off  your grocery list?  Its much easier and not that much more expensive to just skip Meijer."
0,"The food was good, but the service was some of the worst Ive ever experienced. Our waiter, Kiefer, seemed out of it. He also kept putting his hand on my shoulder which made me uncomfortable. His demeanor was degrading when we had questions.  Ive seen other waiters half ass their jobs and do better. Im shocked this is what I received for the price we paid. Now when I go out to eat I think the service I receive all of the time is phenomenal, but then I remember, no, Ive just seen the worst service there is so anything looks great."
0,"I have outoftown guests coming this weekend so I scheduled Kleen Geeks a month in advance.  I even reminded them of the appointment last week.  They assured me they would be there.  When no one showed up, I started calling  minutes,  hour,  hours past their appointment time.  Not only did they not show up, but no one answered the phone or returned their voicemails.  I am really, really disappointed."
0,"I recently started listening to vinyl with a friends persistence and have been enjoying it on a older cheaper pair of speakers. But my friend said that although I had a good turntable I should look into making a new amplifier and speaker purchase. He had some recommendations for equipment, but I preferred to purchase a setup that I could test out and purchase locally. nnI saw this store over the past couple months while in the area, and thought that it might be a good place to buy a new stereo setup for my recent turntable purchase. Unfortunately, every time I was in the area the store was closed.nnToday I happened to be in the area and I was excited when I found that the store was open! I figured today would be a good day to see what they had and possibly make a purchase. I went in and saw that there were two people working in the store, and they were helping two other customers. I patiently waited for  minutes while browsing through what they had in store and finally, Mary,  one of the employees who actually might be the owner asked what she could help me with today. I told her I was interested in a stereo setup, and mentioned what my friend recommended and a budget I could work with. After talking about a couple possible setups, it seemed like she started to get anxious. Finally she asked me out of nowhere  Are you planning on testing out this equipment and buying it online? I responded telling her that I was confused and did not understand why she thought that and asked why she was accusing me of this. She said many people come here and test out equipment and buy it online. At this point I realized that she was disinterested in selling to me not sure why and  was extremely rude. I told that her I was leaving.nnI am very offended by the customer service here, and Im not sure why she chose to speak to me in this way. I am fortunate that these days there is a way for us customers to have some recourse through services such as Yelp!! Stay away from this store if you wanted to be treated respectfully."
0,"Ive been doing CrossFit for about  years and recently visited CFME while in Vegas. What a great location with so much room to play! There could be a bit better signage from the road though. I had tried coming here on a previous visit, got confused on the exact location and then they were closed for some reason and I couldnt get in touch with anyone over the phone. This facility looked really cool and they have a huge space and parking lot available that I was hoping we might be using to do tire flips, sled pulls or some other fun stuff to enjoy the nice sunny outdoors.nnAnyway, this time my friends and I arrived early to fill out the required waiver, etc. but ended up waiting until after the scheduled class time for the coach to arrive. Not really cool... especially since there were another  or so visitors waiting also, along with many members. Being a coach myself, I thought this was unacceptable. The coach was nice enough though and made it a point to have the visitors introduce themselves, which I thought was considerate. The warmup took longer than the actual WOD and since we were already running late, the workout felt rushed. The coach seemed somewhat preachy in her approach and chastised some regular members for jokingchatting, which I didnt agree with since we are adults, not gradeschoolers and we want to have fun, not just workout. BUT, she seemed knowledgable, smiled a lot and was as friendly as she could be considering the big class size.nnThe WOD was not great though. Instead of something a little fun and longer, which a lot of gyms do on Saturdays, we did a  min partner AMRAP with rep ranges too long for either partner to really get in a good sprint sotospeak during their time working. I ended up with a rather lame  minutes of total work... for  including the tshirt. Several visitors and members were conferring as to how it could have been split up differently for a better WOD. nnI did think the option of returning on subsequent days for a free workout was a nice gesture instead of having to pay again. But instead of going back to CFME, my friends and I just jogged to the local park, ran stairs, lunged, squatted and did pushups to get a more wellrounded workout for free.nnIn closing, my intent here is not to be a downer but I did want to provide honest feedback from an experienced perspective. I would want the same thing if someone came to my gym."
0,"I was so excited to come to Mellow Mushroom as it was a place I frequented when I lived in Atlanta.  Needless to say, it is close but not the same as the ATL.  We tried this location on two separate occasions.  My favorite item is the parmesan pretzels, but they are way to greasy here.  The food is a little pricey for what you get.  Also, the last time we were here, at the end of dinner, I sucked up a dirty straw wrapper in my water.  Needless to say, I wont be back any time soon."
0,"Customer service is KEY in any place. Today I walked into sweet addictions and wasnt greeted by the only employee working. I stood there for about  minutes until I said something. The girl still didnt help me. I had ordered an ice cream sandwich cake and all I needed was to pick it up. I will never buy anything for this location again. When a customer walks in they should  always be greeted, even if you are helping another customer."
0,"Note WORST AIRLINE EVER!!! We had a red eye out of LAX to Charlotte, with an hour layover, then off to Cleveland. They emailed mid flight the gate was changedwith no wifi to check the email and they also had us circle the airport for an hour with no reason. Needless to say we plus about  other people on our flight missed our connection by  minutes. They wouldnt even hold the other plane for  minutes and were extremely unapologetic or even helpful after. I will never ever fly with this airline ever again. I hope their business fails and they all get herpes."
0,"Pizza was okay, tasted a lot like Peter piper. Just cheap pizza that is good enough to eat. Crust was super super salty. There are many other pizza places I would eat at before I would get this. Jimmy and joes pizza blows this away. If you looking for just okay pizza at a good price this is for you."
0,"So, Ive read the other reviews on the Restaurant.  Im glad to know Im not the only one that didnt love it.nnIf you dont have reservations and show up promptly...they turn you away.  I watched it happen twice.   Im in another area of service Industry...and I dont believe in turning anyone away for any reason.nnFirst Impression....decor was nice...not too over the top...but still had that Epicenter feel.nnGreat menu with lots of variety.   I ordered shrimp...it came out COLD.  So I sent it back...and then guy who brought it back to me said Now hurry and eat it before it gets cold again.... I was appalled.    Its not my fault that my food was sitting in the window too long before it hit the table.   nAfter the recook  it was fine....I enjoyed my meal.nnService was lacking....between the bouncer guy at the door of a restaurant and the slacker that was waiting on us...Im surprised that we made it to our next venue in time.  Our waiter maybe came over  times the entire time.... I just thought he was on a perpetual smoke break someplace.  Waitstaff can definitely be a little more attentive.nnI probably will not go back due to the priceservicequality ratio.  It wasnt awful...but it was FAR FROM STELLAR."
0,"Store reviewnHow can two meijer be so different? I read the reviews and was thinking it couldnt be that different because the meijer is a corporate store... I was wrong. First the store itself is a lot smaller than the one in Champaign. I agree that the layout is completely weird and someone should be fired. You walk in and you get the fresh fruitvegetable that transitions into the normal grocery shelves, but where is the dairy milk and frozen food. Oh it is located in the center of the store by the clothes. I completely did not believe this.... Overall it is a meijer that is smaller but still well stocked. I am going to the Champaign location because it is significantly closer to home and larger as wellnnPros good sales on fruitsmeats weekly, large inventorynnCons weird store layout, look out for the dairy and frozen food elsewhere, smaller than other storesnnHidden dealsn.

Although its cheap but what you get is what you paid for.nBe careful making your apt, they just  took out  out of my acc for not showing up for a an appt that I made for following week. nAll I can do is warn others to be very careful dealing with location or this company."
0,"Im not a big fan of a steakhouse because they are usually mediocre and overpriced, this being no exception.  The drinks are pathetic, the salad was eh, the dressing store bought, the steaks tough, the bread lousy, the potatoes disgusting, and everything came covered in onions so dont bring a date.  The service was however outstanding."
0,"Meh, indeed. nnIve tried giving this place a second chance...several times. nnIt has nothing to do with the product, this is a chain after all and a bagel is a bagel right?, but with the service. It can get insanely busy, which is not surprising...but Ive been here several times where there hasnt been a line out the door and I am the first in line. Yet the service is slow. Grandma driving slow. On my last trip with emphasis on the last, it took  minutes to get a bagel with cream cheese.nnI find this surprising, seeing as though there are generally a million people working here. What they are all doing behind the counter, Im not quite sure. nnNever again."
0,"I had high hopes for Razzy Fresh, having eaten a fair amount of frozen yogurt at huge, suburban Texas frozen yogurt shops.  Unfortunately, Razzy Fresh failed to live up to most of those expectations.nnThe yogurt was tasty in general but lacked a sort of punch I expect  the taro root yogurt wasnt screaming, IM MADE OF BIG, PURPLE TARO ROOT GUTS, and the arctic vanilla didnt make me feel like I was standing in a blizzard on an ice floe.  The yogurt also came out of the dispensers quickly and seemed a bit thin.  Razzy Freshs toppings were somewhat lackluster, both in quantity and quality, and the blackberries clearly hadnt been cleaned one I took had either leaf or bug bits on it  I threw it out quickly.nnOn top of all that, the price was a bit high.  My girlfriend and I had two small size cups and paid somewhere in the  range for the pleasure, whereas were more accustomed to paying about  for the same amount of yogurt and toppings elsewhere.nnOverall, I was pretty disappointed with my experience at Razzy Fresh today.  It hit the spot because it was warm and humid outside, but in the future, I think Ill seek out alternative frozen yogurt shops for my warm weather refreshment needs."
0,"I only had one beer here, but it was the winter seasonal which they were selling quite a bit of and it wasnt very good. Dont get me wrong, it wasnt a bad beer, but it just didnt do it for me.nnAs a Belgian style winter ale, I expected some flavor. Instead, it was mostly the high alcohol content that I tasted. It just didnt do it for me. It was better with the ginger cookies they served, but thats not enough.nnI cant speak to the food or other house beers, but I may give it another shot when Im back in town. I just expected more from a flagship seasonal.nnNice bar crew, though. Everyone was friendly and helpful."
0,"I can go into more depth all the problems I encountered but Ill keep it brief for the readers. I had a line of credit with the casino. The first time I came down, I asked the cage how should I pay and they said to mail them a check. I mailed them a check for , which they cashed but they also automatically drafted another ,. This caused my checking account to bounce causing all sorts of problems and fees. After much effort, the casino finally agreed not to charge me the extra fees for the returned check but would not repay me for all the fees I was charged on my end by my bank. I sent an email to corporate but received no reply.nnFast forward a few months, I decide to give PH another chance. I book a room and proceed to the casino. I go to a table only to find out that my line of credit has been cancelled due to my check bouncing last time. Of course I did not bring any cash to gamble so I had to take money out of my credit card incurring over  in fees. I complained to my host and to collections why I was not notified that my line of credit was cancelled. I ask them if I can get any kind of credit for all the fees I was charged. They tell me to pound sand. I will never gamble at PH ever again despite the really awesome gambling atmosphere. I will try gambling at VenetianPalazzo because they are pretty generous with offering comped rooms."
0,"I was visiting Vegas with a group of girls and wanted to eat at one of Vegass top restaurants.  Searching through Yelp, Scarpetta seemed like a good choice.  I knew it was more expensive but from the reviews I was assuming it was worth it.  I definitely do not think it was.nnThe food was good, but not worth the price tag.  The pastas were the best part so if you do make it to Scarpetta I would suggest sticking to one of the pastas.  The total bill for the  of us was around .  We ordered a few drinks and a couple bottles of wine and though I dont have anything about the food to complain about I just dont think it was worth .  Normally when I have a meal with that price point I am expecting some experimentation with foods or unique pairings.  Scarpetta did not try anything new.  Steaks, typical pastas, decent portions, but nothing new.  nnThere are so many choices for restaurants in Vegas so I just cant recommend this one."
0,"The kid at the pharmacy is so unbelievably rude just now. My dr.s office called and left a message at am and I called the pharmacy at pm to see if the Rx was ready and they had no recollection of this being called in so I called my doctor again and asked them to call and actually speak to the customer service agents. I gave it two hours called them back just before  and the kid said,yeah we just got it but we have other ppl before you who are also waiting for their Rxs to be filled. I said Im aware of that but what I really felt like saying is it was called in at am!? I downed  ounces of pedialyte to hold me off from getting my medication today and u have the audacity to make me feel like Im being rude?! And then right after I got off the phone with him I received a text that it was ready so... This rant is for the Target pharmacy kid. Screw you, Ive been vomiting for the last  hours and you have hurt my feelings..."
0,"We give this place a  our of . Unlike some of the other reviews, we did not get the upgraded room. Our room was pretty old and run down. Furniture was old, bathroom tile was old and grungy, the tile in the kitchen was old and looked dirty, the room smelled like smoke, and the fridge door was broken. Thankfully we did not spend a lot of time in the room. We would ONLY stay here again if we get a good deal AND an upgradedrenovated room."
0,"waited an hour for baked chicken and lasagna dinners. Chicken was RAW, service was atrocious. Bartender served shots to two very drunken patrons that were next to us. Wont be going back here anytime soon, if ever!"
0,"I dont understand why this place is so popular.  Ive been there  times and each time the food was pretty gross.  Most recently, I ordered a Del Monico sandwich and the thing was dripping with oil.  The beer list is decent."
0,"I cannot believe this place charges for valet. I come to Vegas almost every other month for business andor pleasure and have never paid a nickel in my life for parking in vegas. Plus, after paying that steep  just for parking, they never charged our Tesla after we made the long trek from Orange County. We rolled into town with  miles left on our battery and told valet to please charge the car. They promised to do so, but almost  hours later, I check on my car with my app and find out they never touched it, let alone charge it. Then, I wasnt comfortable driving out around town to dinner and whatever because of the low battery. nnOther than valet problems, decor is new, rooms redone cosmetically, and thats about it. I dont know if I would bother staying here again in the future when there are so many other better options in Vegas."
0,Ok so Im really not that hard to pleases. I fallowed yelp reviews to this place. I was feeling Thai.. Most people had a pretty positive responses to this place so I decided to give it a go... You automatically get three stars in my book if you give me what I ask for.. Then I add or deduct a star depending on if it met or was below or exceeded my expectations... I requested no egg in my dish and she repeated it when read back..there was egg in my dish when I got it... The service was very dismissive and unfriendly..  It either wasnt their day or this just isnt my place because the food itself wasnt terrific..infact it was sub par. This is a disappointment to me because every one had such great things to say. Shrugs oh well.....
0,"What a disappointment!  We just got back from a  night stay. My husband  I are both Hilton Diamond level members and normally get excellent upgrades...not this time.  A few days before our arrival my husband got an excited voicemail from someone at the property  welcoming us and asking for a return call.  My husband returned the call and when they found out that we would be there for business the tone COMPLETELY changed. They realized that a timeshare sale was NOT going to happen.nnWe checked in and were given what I later discovered was the smallest floor plan on the property.  The room was OK but definitely nothing special. So here is the good the bad and the ugly!nStaff.... helpful and polite, always greeted when passing bynnPool... nice pool but three bummers, no misters and there was loud construction on the gazebo adjacent the pool. Depite posters in all of the elevators stating that the pool bar was OPEN it was not.  Thank goodness I had diet coke in my room fridge!nnFood... no real restauant but a nice little take out cafe with salads, sandwiches etc. Again the cafe staff was quite nice. nnHousekeeping.... very nice and accomodating but forgot to leave a backup roll of TP, thank goodness for kleenex.nnDecor...Again OK nothing special. I know that this is a small thing but it really bugged me that there was no garbage can in the bedroom area.nnOne other thing that was irritating is that we got our Diamond Club welcome call at  the evening before check out. This is the call that is made to assure that everything is satisfactory.  NOT much you can do the evening before we check out.nnThe room was worth the price  but I wouldnt stay there again."
0,"Horrendous food  like someone who has never cooked before tried to recreate German delicacies using only their imagination and ingredients from the supermarket in the bad part of town.nnI ordered beef rouladen with cabbage and bacon, the beef was tough, the cabbage tasted like it came out of a can, and the brown sauce covering it all was like something the worst Chinese food restaurant in Nebraska would put on its chicken and broccoli. A floppy  uncooked piece of bacon found floating in this sauce was nausea inducing. The waiter, who could see how uncomfortable I was took it away and I ordered potato pancakes, feeling relatively confident that any restaurant can handle latkes. Another disaster  that I ate because I was two beers deep at that point  greasy, soggy giant discs of grated potato that had a raw taste and texture. If it werent for the generous amount of sour cream and apple sauce  which I have to assume werent made in house  I would have sent those back too. As is after eating their potato pancakes I went to another restaurant to have an actual meal, because I had been made joyless and despondent by Penn Brewerys failure to accomplish the most simple kitchen tasks. nnThe beer is okay, not nearly as good as Church Brew Works and definitely not memorable considering the competitive landscape in the world of craft brewing  and I say that not even having traveled to that many breweryrestaurants, so even on its home turf Penn beer is forgettable. The service was appropriately apologetic considering the garbage plated that night and the space itself is well laid out and attractive. As is I would never go back, I might be tempted if I had strict assurances that the current management and culinary team were thrown out ala Kitchen Nightmares but even then I would need to see a good review. Thanks to the waiter in the white shorts who didnt charge me for the food, I hope you lead a coup and save the Penn Brewery from itself."
0,"Went on a Sunday,  wow the place looked great and was hungry.  Placed our order and thought we were all set.... min later the fries arrived,  awesome especially the truffle dip. nnThen the waiting began,  an hour and fifteen minutes passed before our order did arrive,  i had the steak and my wife had the scallops.  Well it was not worth the wait.  I thought my steak was dipped in salt,  I could not taste the steak,  the salt was over powering.  I could taste it throughout and it left a very bad taste on my palate.  My wifes scallops were over salted too.  Then i start hearing from the table next to me,  told you we should of went to jack in the box. They offered free desserts to a lot of tables, including ours which was nice,  i did not have our meal replaced cause i thought it may take too long and was so hungry so I did a little patting with my napkin to reduce the salt and finished with a large glass of water., but i do not think I am coming back. Maybe a bad day for them but for what you pay you expect good food."
0,Gets a one star because there is not a lower option.  Wife stopped to look at earrings and was ready to purchase before noting one had a chip.  Said we would walk around and think about it.  After leaving owner came across the street and belittle us.  The most rude shop owner I have ever run across.  New definition of customer service. Buyer beware
0,"Met some friends for dinner Sat night. It was totally empty in here for a Saturday evening but the friends we dined with have eaten here before and had good things to say. nI ordered a glass of wine and my husband tried a spicy jalapeno margarita mixed drink. Not bad. The chips and salsa they bring to the table include three salsas one is a more a traditional salsa, one is a bean dip, and the other more of a creamy verde sauce.nOur server told us the fish tacos appetizer was excellent so we ordered those. I ordered the shrimp diablo and my husband ordered the seafood stew in a creamy sauce. nThe fish tacos were just ok. They werent excellent, Ive had far better fish tacos, although I did like the mangojalapeno salsa that came on the side. My entree was VERY spicy, fitting with the name and came with black beans and I decided to try the lemoncilantro rice which was pretty good. I dont think it was worth  though. Highly overpriced for such a simple meal of a few shrimp with rice and beans. nnMy husbands meal tasted good, but he said it was more reminiscent of Italian flavors, and nothing really Mexican about it other than his sides of black beans and Spanish rice. One of our friends ordered a pasta dish with a cream sauce he loved previously, and was disappointed when it came out with spaghetti style pasta vs the linguine hed had before. nAlthough our server was friendly, she was scarce. We waited and waited, even for our drinks. After she took our drink order she apologized for the wait as she said the bartender was MIA all of a sudden. nEven our friends who had better experiences here said this evening was lackluster at best. I just think it was also overpriced for what it was. nAs a side note, I was expecting a huge tequila menu and was excited to try a few, but their drink menu just included wines and specialty mixed drinks. Im sure they have tequila at the bar, but I guess I was expecting it to be featured more."
0,"Service was slow and inattentive. It was a long wait for food to come in, even though there was only  people at the restaurant. nnI ordered soondubu but the soup was like water and the tofu was firm, not soft. There was no flavor what so ever....just a pot of soup with few pieces of carrots and tofu cubes inside. It was just a very sad and disappointing dish that I had to fork  for.  I had to get some sweets to make up for the lack of a meal afterwards."
0,"It pains me to give this establishment  star, but I would give this specific place  if I could.nnI dont know if I went in on a day where the girl making burritos I have no idea her name bc she had no name tag was having a horrible day, or if she was just trying to hurry and leave. I went in at  after Beatles Love and ordered my normal chicken burrito. There was  scoop of brown rice and  people, she asked what type of rice and I replied white, she then turned and rolled her eyes sooo hard I thought they were gonna get stuck. I advised her Im fine with brown and she carried on, the chicken was wayy too charred and she put like a freakin cup full of hot salsa on my chicken. I then asked for cheese, sour cream, and gauc. She had about a sprinkles worth of cheese left, no sour cream and  spoon full of gauc, again there was  patrons waiting. She then replies, we have no sour cream, its  already... OK YOU CLOSE AT  AND I SHOW HER IT WAS ONLY  AND YOU HAVE NO SOUR CREAM!? She then gives me  of a scoop of gauc and proceeds to roll my burrito. I was pretty annoyed bc why am I gonna pay for something that doesnt include everything I want. She then asks the patrons behind me if they were alright not having sour cream, they also have the look of disappointment like myself,  At this point the cashier chimes in and says I can make some real quicknnOK, its at this point my pina colada has kicked in  and I say are you serious? I asked for some and you did not offer me any, yet you offer these folks some? She rolls her eyes and pays me no mind. Throughout this visit I have been patient and just went with the flow, but no way in hell are you gonna piss on me. I tell the cashier that the ladies attitude needs to be brought up to the manager and she turns and says I did not give you an attitude with an attitude btw and Im shocked! She says this in front of other patrons and workers! I told the cashier my comment quietly, but she went and put me on blast!nnI dont know if this woman didnt like me bc Im brown or whatever but she was a total B word! I paid for my shitty burrito, which I wanted to turn around and throw at her face and walked out the door. Im legit disgusted with the workers there! nnAlso, if you ever email corporate over any discrepancies good luck, all they send you is an Im sorry to hear about your experience letter. Pathetic!"
0,"Loved the setting, came out to Lake Las Vegas for a race and arrived late Friday and they were still open. There was live music playing at the Lake which killed the mood a tad but wasnt so bad. nnChecked the menu posted out front, walked in, took a few minutes to be helped. Everyone working seemed to be appalled I showed up on my own. Oops?nnordered the PENNE AL POLLO E POMODORO, didnt get bread until my food came out. Bread was great, pasta was average. Left right away. Dont know if Id come back to this restaurant again in particular but just enjoy the area."
0,"Terrible experience. After receiving an online price quote, drove .hrs to buy an Outback here. When we arrived price was finalized and we gave our personal and financial information and our credit report was pulled.  After all this they significantly increased the stated price.  It was as if they obtained all our information to see how much we could really afford.  Sales manager named Rick Greenwood was unprofessional, insulting and rude.  Would never recommend this dealer to family, friends or anyone!"
0,"Anyone who is losing their hearing but refuses to use a hearing aid will assume everyone else is deaf and speak at about  decibels.  And, of course,  decibels is required when talking on a cell phone which is perfectly acceptable in public.  Cocos, I would like you to meet my stepfather.  He will be dining with you whenever Im involved.  Feel free to provide consistently crappy service.  Judging by my last two visits, that shouldnt be a problem.nnI would say the food at this location is generally decent.  And I would say the servers are generally friendly and pleasant.  Unfortunately, it will take repeated attempts to get your order right.nnI asked a server once if he thought he should write our order down.  He jokingly said no, then came back  minutes later to say he forgot what someone at our table ordered.  He did a nice sales pitch on the sweet potato fries, then brought regular fries anyway.  But, he was so personable I didnt hold it against him.  On my visit last week, four tries to get the breakfast order right.  Supposedly caused by a manager insisting on helping the wait staff by bringing out orders.  Seems more like an attempt to turn tables quicker.  I guess it backfired.nnEnd result...not  a bad place if youre willing to wait or eat what they bring you, rather than what you ordered."
0,I was hoping that this place would surprise me as it is the only location I have seen in Vegas that pulls their own noodles.  Coming from souther CA and growing up with Noodle House in Rowland Heights that pulled their own noodles too I was expecting a lot more than what we got.  nnThe first tip that we should have left and not eaten there was the lack of big table for huge parties.  There were two on opposite ends of the restaurant that would seat  people at each table.  The decor was ultra modern that came out of a magazine but that didnt help the food. nnWe ordered two dishes as we were eat an early dinner.  We had the pork and shrimp won tons with pulled noodles and the general tsaos chicken.  My biggest complaint was the food was BLAND!!!!  The broth that was with the noodles had no flavor.nnThe chicken was bland as well.  Though I was hoping it would be more like a pepper sauce the dish was more of a peking style but was not sweet like Im used to.  Overall I would not come back it was  for two dishes and water.
0,bad service. okay food. but bad service. waited forever for everything.  minutes for food in an empty restaurant and waitresses that just dont give a crap about women who come to eat. waited a while to get a bill too. Unless you have a penis you wont get good service here.
0,"Truffle fries, gourmet burgers, hints of Asian fusion here and there, and food served on plates with four corners.  This is enough to make some people thrilled about a restaurant already.  However, when everybody else seems to be doing the the same thing, each one needs to stand out in some way.

The burger itself was unremarkable.nnOssobuco This was the special for the night.  Unlike the fries, it was incredibly underseasoned and rather dry.  I got it to taste a bit better with some salt, but dry ossobuco is pretty hard to get through as is.

0,"For the record, I do not wax often but when I have, its been in either LA or NYC, where things are typically done better. Now, I can actually say that. My biggest challenge is that my eye brows dont grow so I have them cleaned up about once a year, sadly this place was the wrong choice for my once yearly brow tidy. The staff as you enter are sweet but I had what appeared to be an unhappy brow tidy upper. Even though we didnt click, I didnt want to judge her ability based on her attitude, but I should have.nMy eye brows look like the first day Edward Scissorhands learned how to use his blades. On top of it, the lady said if I dye my brows a bit darker, they would look fuller. Now I have super dark, choppy brows Im blonde and I look like a deer in headlights. nSo sad, now I may have to wait two years for this slow brows to grow back in. ugh...."
0,"Im giving them two stars because the food was decently good. Having said that, all else is pretty negative. Sat outside on a sunny Thursday, was one of less than  tables in the restaurant. Host was nice and inviting, server was slow and lazy. I ordered an ice tea and was finally given it in a dirty glass after I had to ask again for it  min later. That was when we finally saw the server again. Silverware and plates dirty, my wifes water glass had food particles floating in it upon delivery. We wont be back even if the food was ok, I hope the health department goes in there and gets them to clean up their act."
0,"Another disappointment at the Flamingo hotel. nnWe were seated for dinner and there was roughly  other tables with people seated but the rest was pretty open...so basically not a large crowd that night. It took  min to receive waters, and our server never came. We finally saw two servers walking around and they completely ignored us. One looked as us and walked over to the register to chat with whomever while another waitress looked as us and started cleaning down tables. nnWe asked the hostess who our server was going to be because no one gave us the time of day. She said she didnt know and that they would be with us shortly. Instead of getting upset, we decided to wait a couple more minutes. Turns out, more servers were in the back talking to each other which I saw from my seat. nnOne waitress came by and said Ill be with you in a moment while she gave the table next to us their food. She then finished serving the table, walked away, and never came back. nnYup, that was the final straw for us. We got up and left...in the process, my sister spilled her beer all over the table. Well, that gave them something to finally do."
0,"Worst employee ever!!!  I recently visited this theatre with a friend of mine with a walking disability.  I asked an employee Alfredo for some assistance with some extra light for her after the film was over.  Even a flashlight would have been great.  He not only refused, when she finally came out of the theatre he laughed at her.  So insensitive!!!!!  I have made complaints to both the theatre and the main office.  Why this employee is still there is beyond me."
0,"I dont know what to make of the EpiCentre. Is it an outdoor mall? This is nothing to what we have in Dallas, TX. It had restaurants, a CVS, a bowling alley, a movie theatre and a parking gargage. Since it is right across from my hotel, the Ritz Carelton, I had dinner at two of the restaurants, Vida and Enso on two different nights. I even went to the CVS for snacks and drinks. I may go to the movies at the Mez if they are showing anything Im interested in watching. To me, this is just run of the mill. Maybe I am just pissed because my hotel room faces the EpiCentre and I can hear drunkards yelling at the top of their lungs at am while I am trying to sleep and get to work the next day. During the daytime it is nice and quiet. However, if there is an event, which there are a few while I am here, it gets pretty rowdy."
0,"We held a meetup at this location awhile back.  Upon reading some of the reviews especially the review of David R, I decided not to be quiet any longer.  A person that none of our group knew ordered food and drink.  After finishing her food, she left without paying her bill.  None of us knew her.  One by one, our group members individually paid for our fooddrinks.  One member stayed behind to finish watching a game.  He had given the waiter  and was expecting change only to be surrounded by a group of people demanding money for that person that skipped out without paying.  NONE OF US KNEW THAT PERSON.  He explained that he did not know the person.  The employees of the restaurant were literally holding him there encircling him  and threatening to have him arrested.  Finally he paid out of fear for a meal and drinks of a person he didnt even know and has never met.  The management did not return my phone call.  Not only did he lose money for this unknown person, the waiter didnt give his change back from the  should have been around .  The restaurant should hold credit cards if they are fearful of people not paying.  They should not make someone pay for and UNKNOWN persons food.  I would never go to this restaurant again."
0,"Well the Square cafe is highly rated, personally I think there are a ton of better breakfast places out there. I got a classic breakfast, so it should be basic but this was too basic. No flavor in the home fries, I mean how hard would it be to add salt and pepper or some kind of store bought seasoning. It was fairly busy but Id call it a normal rush however before I finished eating I was handed the check. I think they they probably are nice or friendly but I didnt experience it. A combination of soso food and not great service make this the one and only time I will be visiting."
0,"If youve ever had good Mexican food then you DO NOT want to eat here. The food was mediocre at best. The only reason for the  stars is the service. The host and wait staff were very pleasant, but other than that the food was terrible. You are better off crossing the street to Smokehouse. We had dinner there the next day and it was fantastic. Skip this place and cross the street."
0,"I came in on a Wednesday night to watch the suns game and boy is this place depressing. Super slow service, the bar tender was more concerned about gossiping with coworkers. I waited ages for an appetizer. This place used to be good wtf happened?"
0,This place is just an overpriced resale store.  Saw alot of cool looking items but after close inspection found they were made of mdf and made in China.  Also saw furniture from Target and RossMarshalls......also made in China and mdf that were priced higher than the actual sale prices than in the stores that originally sold them.  What a crock! Im done paying premium price for junk........I ended up going to Lynns world of consignment where they have much more realistic prices and better quality including some nice antiques.  Or just Craigslist!
0,"Ive been to Vegas many times in a year, but I dont think I will ever come back to Harrahs in Las Vegas. It has come to be the most unsanitary and has no openair for the hotel guests. Every time I went down the lobby I had to make sure I leave the hotel within  minutes or I will get a major headache. The vast majority of the people here at Harrahs smoke a lot, so I do not recommend this hotel for any family that has any infants or young children with them. nnThe next thing why I dont like this hotel are the rooms. Its nice to have a simple room for you to sleep in, but there was only one blanket that can barely cover a whole persons body. And not to mention the shower drain was terrible. No matter how much we tried to shut it off it still manages to make small water drops which was hard to deal with. Another bad thing is the air conditioner is very loud up to the point you can lose your sleep over night."
0,"We just arrived in Fountain Hills, after a long days drive of  hours.  Naturally, we were starving, and needed something quick and filling to eat.  This Burger King is very dumpy, and looks like it needs an upgrade.  The guy who waited on me was very sullen, and didnt seem to care that customers pay his salary and keep the economy moving.  He just pushed the bag of food at me, and grunted here you go like I was a horse, or dog.  Anyways, at least the food was hot, otherwise, they would lose a star."
0,"stars for the food that was good, ZERO stars for the horrible service.  I dont mind waiting for a table, but when youre eventually sat you shouldnt wait  minutes to be greeted by a server.  Never saw the server again after the order was taken until we flagged him down to pay.  No managers table touching, couldnt even find someone to ask for extra silverware.  Food was good though, its a shame that the service was horrendous!  They need server training ."
0,"We used them for our property management and even talked to their references before we hired them. But they just take your money and do not deliver results. After having a property under their management for  months, they have not even completed the minor fixed up. They quote low and charge high. They might be affordable if you can wait forever for them to bring your property to the market.nnDo not believe their references. They do not response to phone call."
0,"I have avoided this place since it opened, but a friend insisted we meet up there for dinner.  First thing I noticed was the dirty fork in my silverware set.  It had definitely gone through a dishwasher, which baked on a nice chunk of food from the previous user.  Pointed it out to the waiter who just swapped out my silverware set with some from a nearby table.  After that, I needed a drink.  Ordered a Bud Light Lime since there was a huge banner that said . for that brand all during May.  Nope, they were out and the waiter said we could NOT substitute for another drink i.e. a Corona or something similar.  Ok then, Ill just order a . mushroom and swiss.  Food came and the fries were cold.  Told the waiter we wanted new fries and he obliged.  The burger was nothing special.  Should have been half the price we paid.  Then, after Im half way done with the burger, the waiter returns and says he checked with the manager and we could get a Corona for ..  Too late.  By this time, I just wanted to leave.  The place was not busy at all, Im not sure what took him so long to check with the manager about that.  I hate these theme restaurants and this trip just served to solidify my beliefs that gimmicky restaurants usually do not have good food.  Ill stick with  Guys or Nitty Gritty when I want a good burger.  Hell, just go next door to TGIFridays, even they beat this place."
0,"Im shocked this place is averaging as high as it is. I ate there for the second time last night and the meal is best defined as overpriced mediocrity. The oysters were good, steak ok, desert a waste of calories.  I was there there the st time as part of a hosted corporate event and the food was bad. I hoped if eating at a table vs private room it would be better. Wrong!  Save your money and eat elsewhere... Preferably not in City Center though as all of those restaurants seem to be overrated."
0,"I reserved a car online for my uncle March th since it was  cheaper then doing it over the phone.  My uncle went in to pick it up the next day and informed them that he has liability insurance and he didnt want the damage waiver. Christal told him that it was NEVADA STATE LAW to either have the damage waiver or their own insurance.  She said they can call their insurance company to add collision insurance and cancel it after they return the car or get the damage waiver.  Because he thought it was the LAW he got the damage waiver.  I looked on their website which it states that damage waiver is completely OPTIONAL, so I called Christal and she told me it was a gray area and in Nevada it was STATE LAW.  She then said they could have gotten the car without the damage waiver but the manager would require a deposit for the full amount of the vehicle! I asked if all the Enterprises were like that and she said yes.  I called another Enterprise and they said damage waiver is OPTIONAL and there is NO DEPOSIT needed even if you only have liability insurance.  I called back and spoke with the manage Daniel who told me that Christal was just saying liability insurance is Nevada State Law, if that was the case then why would he need to call his insurance company??? Daniel then told me a fake story of a customer that wrecked a car and didnt have insurance so he had to pay  out of pocket! Really?!? Enterprise, the largest car rental company in America doesnt have secondary insurance on their fleet of vehicles? That is the risk of rental car business, so I am sure their cars are insured! Daniel then tells me we can come back and get our money back since my uncle has a major credit card and that usually has insurance for rental cars.  Sure enough we call Mastercard and it IS covered.  So we drove all the way back and got our damage waiver back and of course Christal was not there.  LYING to get damage waiver tacked on to a bill? Is that great customer service?!?"
0,"The last time I was in Phoenix I had a business dinner here and ordered their wings and then some special meal included salad, chicken and something else.  The place was empty and the waitress was actually bothered we had chosen to eat dinner in her section.  To make a long story short  I got sick that night with some type of food poisoning and spent the next  hours trying to sleep between throwing up and running a fever.  Will definitely never go back."
0,Messed up my order and delivered it  hours late. This was from the Powers location in Mesa. Is it really that hard to make and deliver a pizza. Obviously this place is in need of new management. I think his name was Rocky. Never ordering from this place again.
0,"We decided to give this local pizza joint a chance since its really the only one in my neighborhood. Typically I order my pizza from Costco because of the quality of ingredients, size and value. nnI decided on two pizzas.....one sausage and mushroom which the girl on the phone said the sausage was made fresh everyday in house and one cheese pizza. We also thought we would give their wings a try since Costco doesnt offer wings in their food court.nnWe were very disappointed and will probably not return. First, the pizza was very expensive for what you get. The pizza is in this strange oval shape and the crust was burnt in many locations. The crust is very thin and I couldnt get the burnt taste out of my mouth to enjoy the other ingredients.nnThe wings....meh, Ive experience better. These guys were smaller than the average wing and I felt they were very fatty. nnI was really hoping that Rochellis would be a hit because I would much rather support a localfamily restaurant that buying from a warehouse that I can find in every major city. I have lived in the area for about  years and this location has been  or  different pizza restaurants.....I hope the writing isnt on the wall and the restaurant gets their act together."
0,"gotta agree wJosh, got dragged there twice last yr as part of a group and the place is the bottom of the barrel as far as bars go....funny thing is when it first opened probably  yrs ago in its original incarnation it was a cool unique place to go and we went there often....now it seems like the help there are people who cant get a bar job anywhere else, most of the patrons are a little skeevy, or else guys whore looking for trouble, and the atmosphere is oppressive  dingy..WAY TOO many places to go in CLT to put up wa bar like this"
0,Adam WnnUnfortunately I wasnt too impressed about the restaurant and the food.. Nevertheless I will start with what I enjoyed.. German cuisine is not Always the most popular but to prepare the many exotic dishes... Its going to be tough to compete.  The service and atmosphere was nice.  But when it comes to the food. You better win the customer over on the first visit if you want repeat customers. The presentation is and must be atrnAttractive to the eye and and the taste must be able to stop the talking at the table but afterwards not stop by getting the word out.  I had the pretzel dumplings with gravey and mushrooms. . Sounds good and tastes good... But I just wished they had put real pretzel Instead of rye bread. Will I go back... Probably not... There are just too many other eateries that will give you a better experience.
0,". stars? Are you out of your minds?! I went there last night out of pure desperation as it was so late. The only healthy thing on the menu was a tilapia dish which they wouldnt let me order cos Im not a senior. Am I not a paying customer? Who cares how old I am?! So anyway, I ordered a veggie burger with fries and rushed back to my hotel. Why? Cos I just couldnt sit there any longer! As I waited for my food, I noticed a humungous hair ball on the floor which kept blowing in towards me in the wind each time the door opened. And worse still  no one came to clean it up until after  mins! Ugh!! I cant tell you how many times I checked the inside of my burger! Never again!! No more slumming it in Vegas. Its just not worth it!"
0,"Its Walmart. As far as Walmarts go it is very clean inside and out. That is a plus compared to most locations Ive been too. Id still much prefer we had something else in our community, but it is what it is. If they ever start treating their employees better then I would consider giving them more stars, but they continue to pay their employees low wages and offer them little to no benefits."
0,this would  be a  star review if it werent for the pushy obnoxious waiter nnWe made it clear we just wanted a few rolls and apps...he continued to push us to have a full on meal and order super fancy expensive drinks...

When I asked what other specials they had the bartender scowled at me.nnLastly, many of the dances are quite different here. Its not revolvers fault but its strange when youve been dancing a song for years but now its the revolver way.nnHonestly, I have a much better time at Stoneys South.

0,"Bad experience. I was excited to eat at a Peppermill as I used to love the one in Concord, CA. Either things changed or this is not a good restaurant.nnI walked in and was seated at the counter per my request. Although the spot was not cleaned, I assumed it would be soon. The waitress came, after a longer than average wait upon arriving, took my drink order, and left to give me time to decide what I wanted. Five or so minutes later, she returned to take my order. I saw her again once my food was ready and she looked at the spot in front of me with a look like where should I put this as no one came to clean the counter. So I said well I guess Ill sit over here since no one is going to clean this and sat in the empty space to my right. She looked at me with the deer in the headlights look and said oh, uh, sorry. She set my food down and I didnt see her again until she breezed by to drop off my check. She had time to chitchat to another patron an obvious regular but not to see if I needed anything like a drink refill. Just as I am ready to leave to pay, she then notices my empty glass and asks if I need a refill.nThe food was mediocre but no where near what it used to be, and the fries were barely luke warm.nI paid, left her a low tip but still more than I should have, and left. The spot I originally sat at had never been cleared. My first and last visit here. I can get better service and food from Dennys........and I hate Dennys!"
0,"I am a las vegas local and i chose to spend my new years celebration and birthday  at the SLS. it went bad from the check in where they told me my room had been blocked out and they had to find another room. i booked a  sq ft lux king suite high floor. when i got to the room it was a smaller corner room. i called the front desk and they said it was their mistake but could not do anything about it since it was new years. i talked to a manager and all she was interested in was getting me off the phone she told me they had no other rooms available. i went back to the SLS website where i originally booked my room to see if they had availability and guess what they had an even larger room  sq ft for a cheaper price than what i had paid, but the manager insisted they had no other rooms available. Beware of this resort i have stayed at most of the other high end resorts in Las Vegas and this resort and staff are not on their levels of service. i wish i could take it all back because they ruined all of my new years and birthday plans. if this had happened at any other resort in town Aria i would have been comped and upgraded to a bigger room and there really was no availability they would put you up in a comparable resort with an upgraded room."
0,"I recently returned for a sixth visit and was sorely disappointed. The Iberico ham was, as usual, wonderful. Other offerings were much less successful. The smoked eel was somewhat unctuous and certainly nothing special. After having been taken off the menu for some time, the cebette white onion tart has made a return, albeit without the familiar asparagus tips, smoked bacon and quail egg mirror. The new version is adorned with thinly sliced root vegetables that give the dish a decidedly bitter flavor that immediately gave rise to a case of indigestion. A major failure here. The hanger steak was ordered medium rare but arrived medium. It was fair, but sinewy and, of course, overcooked. Perhaps my fault for not sending it back for a medium rare replacement. The shishito pepper accompanying it was more than a touch bitter. In better, past versions, the pepper has had a slightly sweet pungency that perfectly complemented a perfectly cooked steak. No such luck this time. The bitter brown seeds inside the pepper indicated that it was past ripe. My server brought me the braised beef cheeks next. Odd since I didnt order them. He said he ordered them for me. As I said, odd. The meat was a grayish and overcooked lump the red wine reduction an acidic and cloying flavor mask. I ate two bites of this thoroughly unpleasing dish, an uninventive lead weight. The famous Robuchon whipped potatoes that came with the beef cheeks were, as always, rich and delicious, but manand chefcannot live by whipped potatoes alone. And certainly not at LDJRs prices. I noticed again that the French chef came out to chat up some diners who were speaking French amongst themselves. I have seen this happen before and cant help wonder why he cant deign to say hello or ask about the dining experiences of any of the nonFrenchspeaking diners at the counter. Overall, a very disappointing meal. So much so that I am taking LDJR out of the rotation after six visits. Chef Robuchon needs to give some attention to his Las Vegas workshop, where many offerings have grown stale in both concept and execution. There are many other great restaurants in Vegas where exciting things are being done. All without the Gallic attitude and astronomical prices."
0,Used to come here a lot its right around the corner from my house but theres nothing really special. The gel nail Polish is limited and a lot of them left ridges on my nails. Every time I got my nails done here I always had go go back because they take too long or they dont do them right and every time I went back for them to fix a problem the next day after getting my manicure I would get an unwelcoming look.
0,"We have been to City Tavern numerous times  as there are not very many options in the area. We always want to like it and have given plenty of chances but now we are officially throwing in the towel. nnThe menu is large, well laid out, and planned. There are many app options and entree combinations which are a plus.  nnOur first visit I could not have been more excited about trying the mixed grill entree with steak, pork loin and rack of lamb. Nothing was cooked well, meat was over, pork was dry and the lamb had an off grayish color, entree was sent back and replaced.nnWe have had similar experiences since, and it is something new every time. Broken sauces, poor service, slow servers, overunder cooked items etc. nnAfter a few months we gave it another try, and like usual it was just ok. We had great service, and ordered the  courses for  special. My egg roll, short ribs and desert were acceptable but pricy.  My wife started with the shrimp cocktail, big mistake.  small shrimp looked to be precooked, frozen, thawed and placed on a bed of mixed greens. Cocktail sauce was a solid gelatin disgusting mess. Turned over the ramekin and it didnt move. We have sent back  items at restaurants in  years living in the area,  were at city tavern, the other was our first and final visit to the gridiron.nnCity tavern has a great spot, nice decor, and a good menu. The kitchen and wait staff can clearly not execute. Sadly, we have no more chances to give and dont want to spend  each to see if they can figure it out."
0,"My friend went here for the st time, and will be the last.  I walked in asking for a mani pedi... and not one person looked at me or greeted me until I had been standing up front for  mins or more, then they told me min. So I waited, my friend showed up mins and we still waited another  mins.  As for the nails. they convinced me to upgrade and it says in description that you get  min massage, I got zero minutes. Very disappointed.  My friend was almost done by the time someone started doing anything for me.  We spend hours in this place.  My girlfriends gels nails were sloppy and the worker said come back tomorrow...what?...who has time!?! The best part is leaving and going to sushi. Sorry. I will not go here again."
0,"I read a review that I think perfectly describes this restaurant. The sauces taste like spaghetti sauce BAD spaghetti sauce. Ive tried chicken tikki masala, butter chicken, and now yesterday kadai chicken. All entrees werent spicy and it tasted like bland tomato and ketchup mixed with chicken. No seasoning, no spices of any kind. Because I live in the area I was really hoping this restaurant would be good. For some reason all of the India restaurants that Ive tried in Oakland have been HORRIBLE. The best India restaurant, in my opinion, is India Palace downtown. Awesome food. Stay away from this travesty in Oakland."
0,"I am really sad. I went here to get a birthday cake for my babys first birthday. I am so excited planning this event, and I know that not everyone can be as excited as me, but Barbs totally deflated me. Maybe I had too high of expectations? I went there and told them I wanted to order a cake. I had a few cake designs from pinterest on my phone. The man behind the counter did not seem to even want to deal with me, he kept talking to the people coming into the store. All he said was can you just email me a picture? I then said oh, ok, can you give me a card with the address on it? He totally ignored me and started helping another customer. I got his attention and said I would like to try a cupcake to help choose a flavor and what would he recommend. He said the red velvet was popular, but did not really seem to care to keep helping me. It was sad. I guess I expected them to be wanting to give me design ideas and flavor ideas, maybe show me some pictures, or give me an idea of cost. Basically he just wanted me out of the store. I drove  minutes to go there because of the reviews, and left the store in  minutes with a red velvet cupcake and no cake ordered. They got an extra star because the cupcakes were very good, and the price was good. Will I be back? Probably not, I need some enthusiasm with my deserts."
0,"This chain is similar to a Forever . Mixed feelings about it boutique feels a lot  more upscale than the lowbudget price tags, but quality is lacking. Trendy styles dont make for longterm wear anyway, so I guess it evens out.nnBut this location is sorely lacking in the service department. The fact that I encountered three different associates and was never once greeted or asked if I needed any help is ridiculous. Signage informs you that refunds are not given, but store credit is.nnAlso, I dislike how the shoes are set up on display you have to ask to try on  pair in your size, to be pulled from the back. Who does this any more? There was a staff member present in that department, but she never once spoke to me. Ill take my business elsewhere."
0,"The omelette I had for breakfast, unfortunately, was unremarkable. Very small for  with no sides except for tater tots. I requested toast instead and what came back was two slices of, for lack of evidence, wonder bread toast. Not buttered either.nnAsked for a coffee with my breakfast. The staff was overtaxed so they forgot that too. nnTo me, it comes off like theyre trying to grab some of the weekend breakfast crowd but yet are only half committed to the effort. Was hoping for better because I like the location and decor."
0,"If this place were anywhere else but the lobby of one of the busiest hotels on Planet Earth, it would have shuttered long ago.  Nothing special about its ambiance, food, or flavor.  For the prices, you can do so much better.  Id rather eat at Cheesecake Factory than here even if youre buying. nnIts convenient. Leave it at that."
0,Tried to go here on Saturday during what were posted as normal business hours. I called a few times and kept getting the answering machine and then decided to go over. The doors were locked and there were sorry we missed you notices from the post office on the door. I walked around the back and a guy was there who had the building next door and said that they just werent open today he guessed. I thought Saturdays would be the most busy time for a hair salon? It was odd and I ended up taking my business elsewhere.
0,"Wow, how is it possible for a Cajun place to have so little flavor? Everything here was completely bland, uninspired, and barely resembled the amazing food that comes out of New Orleans. Ive seriously had better Lean Cuisines than what we ordered. It probably didnt help that we came a few days before Christmas, originally planning to eat at Revolution Pizza across the street, but having to settle on Boudreauxs because Revolution was closed for the holidays. As soon as we walked in you could feel the nasty cigarette smoke in the air httpwww.flickr.comphotoswedoitforloveinset, I definitely do not miss that about North Carolina restaurants.nnAfter waiting well over  minutes, someone finally came by our table to bring us some water, but they didnt take our order. We waited another  minutes to at least see a waiter, and I finally got impatient, went over the bar, and asked who the hell we could give our order to because we had stuff to do besides sit around in an empty restaurant. Apparently there was some confusion over who was supposed to take our table, and instead of figuring out which of them should do it they though the best course of action was to ignore us completely, not smart.nnSince we were already delayed a good bit due to the slow service, I decided to only get one appetizer for the table, the gator bites. I really love the flavor and texture of gator when cooked properly, and my mom or Nicole had never had it before, so I wanted them to try it as well. The pieces we got were pretty miniscule httpwww.flickr.comphotoswedoitforloveinset, and the plate as a whole wasnt much in size or appearance. They basically charge you for novelty, and then make it as generic as possible. In fact, the pieces were so small, some bites wound up being more breading than meat, really sad. The cajun mayeaux was also far too creamy, and too much mayo and not enough cajun.nnI ordered the shrimp and crawfish etouffe as my main lunch item, as I generally love anything cooked in a good roux. This was another tragic failure. The shrimp were not cooked properly, and the crawfish was virtually missing. The roux was a sloppy mess httpwww.flickr.comphotoswedoitforloveinset, and even the cornbread was doughy instead of crumbly. Worst of all, there was NO flavor, it tasted so horribly bland. Etouffee is supposed to be one of the crown jewels of Creole cuisine and they butchered it.nnMy mom ordered the blackened chicken salad, which sadly was probably the best thing at the table, but unfortunately it too was still lacking any solid flavors. How you manage to cook something blackened and leave it devoid of any charred or spicy flavors is beyond me, but it looked like they just rubbed some red pepper on and prepared it normally. nnI didnt even bother trying Nicoles oyster poboy, because the baguette was completely ruined httpwww.flickr.comphotoswedoitforloveinset. The bread was practically crunching off like charcoal with each bite she took, and the oysters themselves were tiny and fried for entirely too long. The fries were edible, but overcooked as well, and probably sitting for a while because they werent very warm.nnHow much of this horrible meal was due to it being Christmas week and them probably understaffed and underenthused about having to work Im not really sure, and I honestly dont care. If youre going to be open you should treat every day the same, and give customers the same quality of service you normally would, otherwise give everyone a  discount for your  effort."
0,"Overall I had a good experience, except for the steak I had in the hotel restaurant. For the sake of convenience I ate in the hotel restaurant instead of going out. The restaurant presented itself as a higher class facility that should have excellent food. However that is not the case. I ordered a  Rib Eye that tasted like leather. I had asked for steak sauce because the steak had literally no flavour and was tough, even though I should have asked for a new steak. I had enough when I got to about the last ubc of the steak and asked to see a manager. When the manager arrived I had explained to him my situation and stated my  steak tasted more like an  steak. He then said the company would give me a  discount off the meal, which is nothing more than an insult. Additionally I brought this up to the front desk on checkout and still nothing else was done. Because of the lack of courtesy and appreciation of my business, I will never return to this hotel chain again."
0,"Met my sister and her family here for breakfast.  I was very hungry.  Walked in and saw my sister and family sitting at a table.  We sat right away.  The place was nice. Started talking and notice after  minutes no one offered coffee, water or juice. Waited another  minutes still no one came to the table. Finally one of the waitress acknowledged us and that someone would be right with us. Waited another  minutes and we finally had to ask someone to get someone to wait on us.  The waitress apologized and took our orders. Another  minutes went by again and we did not get our drinks. We had to ask another waiter. He apologized and got our drinks. nnAfter a little wait we finally got our food.  Nice portions, presentation and food tasted great. The wait staff was more attentive because the breakfast crowd slowed and they werent so overwhelmed. nnOverall the food was good biscuts were greatbut the service lacked.  I will give them another try and hopefully the service will be much better."
0,"I am not from Arizona and had flown in to visit my boyfriend. We decided to get sushi on a Saturday night around . The restaurant was pretty packed. We were greeted by someone who shouted across the room and then ushered to the bar area outside. nnI must say, the decor and vibe of the place was one of a kind. However, so was the bartender. He came over after we had just sat down to get our drink orders. Even before I uttered out the name of the martini I wanted, hes got his hands out for our IDs. He did show us how to do a saki bomb and my sex on the peach martini was quite strong. nnThe food we ordered trickled to us slowly. However, we did not have any plates or forks or anything of that matter. After I asked a server to bring us silverwearchop sticks, I watched him return to the sushi bar and completely forgot about us. My boyfriend had to hunt down the bartender so we could actually eat instead of sitting there and staring at our food. nnSeaweed salad was lacking vinegar, it was a bit bland. The potstickers were ok, after you dip it in the extremely spicey sauce you mask any kind of taste anyways. We got the dragon roll and the captai crunch rolls and the spicey tuna. They were mediocre and yes, they were pretty much loaded with sweet sauce and deep fried except for the spicey tuna. We were never asked if we wanted dessert. Instead, we just received our bill.nnThe entire time we were there though, I could hear all the drama between the servers. It was like a catfight and I had front row seats to the show. Definitely not very professional. My biggest complain is the service, this place would be X better if the servers actually did their jobs."
0,"After reading a few positive reviews online about this place used to be the Barbary Coast, my friends and I have decided to give it a try.  Why would anybody spend over  per night on a room just for the purpose of sleeping?  Come on, its Vegas, and people dont really sleep anyways.  nnDue to the limited occupancy in this hotel, there is never a line at the checkin.  Although the hotel is small, old, and smelly, it has enough gaming tablesslots and a few restaurantsshops here and there, and it even has a Western Union.  nnOriginally, we booked a standard room with two queen beds.  But my friend got talked into paying almost double for a suite.  I have to tell you, the suite is actually pretty nice.  But only for the three of us, its kind of excessive.  After a whole afternoon of gambling, sightseeing, and eating at the Buffet of Buffets see my review at  httpow.lymbQA, when we got back to our suite, we found a cockroach lying on the carpet in front of the bedroom.  Right away, we called the front desk and requested them to send someone up to check it out immediately.  They said theyll send an engineer.  An engineer?  We waited for over  minutes, and finally Steve the Engineer showed up.  Without any hesitation, he used a cloth to gobble up the poor roach as soon as we pointed to him.  Further to our dismay, we found a full pack of smoke underneath the sofa in the same suite.  Afterwards, we went downstairs and told the front desk that we did not feel comfortable and safe to stay at the same suite again.  They said the suites were full, but theyll switch us to a standard room.  Were asked if theyll comp us for the room, but they said we need to talk to the manager in the morning.  nnDespite the roach problem, the value of this hotel is decent, the suite is nice, but thats about everything thats good in this hotel.  We will definitely not come back to this hotel, mainly because this hotel is very old, cannot draw crowds, and not very sanitized."
0,"The only great thing about this place is the patio. The service is totally  hit or miss. The bartender was more interested in talking to his buddies than asking us if we wanted a drink, it took him over  minutes with no one else there to acknowledge us. The stuffed mushrooms were very bland and I had to send them back bcuz they were luke warm. They came back nuked and soggy."
0,"Ordered the pizzawing special. Pizza was OK but the sauce lacked flavor and the crust was not as crispy as I like it. nnThe wings looked great, but the buffalo sauce was watered down and not very spicy.   nnService was below average but not terrible."
0,"The only reason worth going here is to ogle the scenery. Its a oneoff tourist event, and I dont discourage outoftowners to visit because everyone loves to drink beer in a fabulous church. However, this is not a place for locals. The food is snooty and overpriced. Head over to the Bloomfield Bridge Tavern if you want some good pierogies. nnThe beer here isnt bad but you have to suffer through the insufferable waitstaff to drink it. Head to Penn Brewery for a good Pittsburgh brewery. nnOverall, walk in, look around, get a beer at the bar if you must, and take off for greener pastures."
0,"Total failure in execution on a take out order consisting of  dozen  wings which I thought were good last time and a custom pizza. nnThe wings were soggy and and had little flavor. It also looks like some of the pieces were not fully cooked. nnThe pizza was an abomination that had a base resembling a straightfromthefreezerisle pizza in consistency and taste. nnAfter my second goround with Wolfleys, I significantly regret having such a high initial opinion of their food."
0,Dont waste your time! I just tried to go here for the rd time and there is always a ridiculous wait. They either need to hire a lot more people or allow people to make reservations. This car wash is  minutes from me and I will never bother trying to go again. Go to Windy City Car Wash. Great service and you can call ahead to schedule an appointment.
0,"Welp, Thriftys has finally bitten the dust. I was once impressed, but now have had two separate trips to only return with shirts and a white coat that was only pressed, not cleaned. How do I know this? Because there was a pen mark on one shirt, a red mark on the white coat, and a mystery spot on another shirt. After bringing my dry cleaning home, when untagging them all I noticed the spots were still there. Ridiculous for a cleaners. And no, they were not permanent stains as I was able to easily remove them and I am hardly a laundry expert.nnDisappointed Thriftys, and Im sorry to break up with you. I must say, it is you, not me this time. We had a good run, but weve grown apart. Ive been loyal, but deserve better right now. I wish you the best and hope you turn your act around."
0,"You get what you pay for. In this case, perhaps a bit less. Unless youre interested in deeply smokefilled casino areas. I experienced much better ventilation in all the  or so casinos I stepped foot in during my  night stay.  Also, the hotel rooms toilet flushed extremely slow. Even Imperial Palace had powerassisted toilets. The food variety at the various restaurants inhouse were dull, and the buffet was no better than a Hometown Buffet not a compliment for those that like that place. Unfortunately, convenience played the key part in why I chose one of either McDs, Pizza Ht Xpress, Quiznoz, Krspy Kreme, or Round Table Buffet.  yrs old facility going on . At least my inspection of bed bugs came up clean. Oh, didnt mention the night Resort Fee for I believe the poolspa use, and the WIRED internet no wireless available both of which I didnt use. Who can really enjoy a pool that lacked trees or shade. Tropicana had a better environment for their pool area. I barely spent  per day in the room, but next time Ill still pay  more for a trip if it keeps me out of the Excal."
0,"Couldnt agree more with the majority of reviews. Its not good.nnI had gone to Best Buy to buy a new fridge.

But of course you leave regretting your actions almost immediately. Still, it worked. nnI have a new fridge."
0,"I decided to go to this location because its closer than the Scottsdale one where I originally got my contact lens prescription. Next time I will drive to Scottsdale to avoid the terrible service. Ended up waiting nearly  minutes just to get my new contacts. There was only one guy working the optical department and a massive amount of people and phone calls coming in. Obviously they need to staff better because you could tell he was getting flustered and was blatantly rude to a couple of the customers ahead of me. For my new disposable contacts it was .  for a twoweek prescription! Are you freaking kidding me? Needless to say I went in with a headache and left with a migraine.nnOh and on top of that I thought getting a slice of delicious Costco pizza would help after such a crap experience but alas I was wrong. The lady at the food court again there was only ONE person working was rude and I felt I was in a drill line. She literally threw my receipt at me. Well, geeze thanks. Oh and the pizza definitely didnt taste like the Costco pizza Im used to.nnFurthermore, what the hell is wrong with people who live over here? Not only were the employees rude but so were the customers.nnThree strikes and Im out of there."
0,"Im visiting from the Los Angeles area and came here with a group of  on the recommendation of someone that lives near this resturant.nOne person in our party ordered green curry and when the dishes came out, they gave her red curry. The person in our party told the waitress that she ordered green curry, the waitress argued and argued that red curry was ordered and refused to take it back and left it on the table. So my group member reluctantly ate it. I ordered Kung pow chicken and it was about the worst I ever had, but maybe it was my fault, ordering a Chinese dish at a Thai resturant. It was extremely salty. I tried my wifes mint beef dish and that was also very salty. Bottom line service thumbs down. Food thumbs down."
0,I wish I could give this place no stars! Right off the bat when I got here the lady at the front desk was super rude! Then when I got into the hotel room the bathroom still had feet print from the nightprevious guest before it was disgusting and made me very nervous to shower in. The interior of the rooms are nice Ill give them that but I called for towels  separate times and was told they were on theyre way and ended up walking to the empty lobbyfront desk to get them myself. Everything is broken here one elevator that doesnt work... The jacuzzi was colder then the pool and even when asking for maintenance it still didnt work. Its defiantly not walking distance from the strip and that shuttle they offer is non existent so bring some running shoes if you stay here. I appreciate that they trying to keep the guest safe by only being able to get in the elevatorsparking garagefront entrance with your room key but the building is super dark and feels like a prison ... If your looking for the entrance sign its made out of plastic an youll have to shine your brights when you pull up to see it... And unless you get a room  facing seven youll being staring at what looks like some scary ghetto. Thanks for cleaning my room for the few days I stayed here man my room was so clean but my friends room across the way never once got maid service? Maybe thats why my bathroom was so nasty someone got way to lazy and forgot a few spots better yet a bunch of rooms . I would not recommend this place to anyone ... Take what your gonna spend and find something on the strip. This place sucks

0,"This was first and last time eating here  My husband stopped in tonight to pick up some food and brought it home. I ordered the  rolled tacos with cheese and guacamole and he ordered the machaca burrito and a side of chips, cheese, and guacamole. the guacamole was WAY too salty. It was like eating straight salt. Since the chips and cheese were covered in the guacamole we had to throw it away. I had to scrape the guacamole off of my rolled tacos. When my husband unwrapped his machaca burrito the tortilla was practically dripping with grease. He took of the tortilla and put the contents on a plate. There was hardly any beef and it was so greasy. He took two bites and threw it away.  Maybe it was so bad since he stopped in right before they closed, but we will never step foot in there again. Horrible."
0,"We arrived at pm on a Saturday evening. We sat next to the window to get a view of the patiopool area. It is mid August and they had the door open to the pool area, OPEN! It was so hot and uncomfortable in the restaurant. The open door invited unwelcome guests to our dining experience like flies on the window and  birds that hung out around our table. nWe ordered grilled asparagus  for  wilted spears that comes out to . a SPEAR.nI ordered King Crab legs for dinner. They came on a plate of ice. They were only slightly cracked. I asked for crab leg crackers. The waitress said that they didnt have any. How was I supposed to eat my crab legs? She took them back and had them split again. Needless to say I ended up with crab meat in my hair, on my lap, and on the floor. nMy bf had a burger that he compared to the average burger joint.nThe resurrection of the meal was the monkey bread. It was hot, moist, and delicious."
0,"Everytime I go in this store I want to throw my phone against the wall and never come back...Sidenote I stopped using Sprint for my personal phone because of the HORRIBLE service here  There used to be a few select ladies that genuinely cared about the customers.  They are gone now and it has gone down hill from then.nnI walked in today because I still have  business lines with them and needed to replace a phone.  wasnt asking for it to be fixed, just upgrade  The guy at the podium had ANYTHING better to do and told me, Alberto is a specialist at upgrading phones... as he pawned me off...nnSo Alberto takes us back to his counter to get this handled...meanwhile another employee is hoping it rains harder so they can close the store...wtf!!!  Simple talk under normal circumstances but you just know these people here could give two shts about the customer.  Then Alberto and rain dance coworker tell me that unless I have  phones on my account I cant charge the new phone to the account.  I ONLY have   Note two months ago I charged an upgrade to the account.   She says they havent allowed that since November.  She tells Alberto, you can ask managers name but hes just going to tell you the same thing.  Not a big deal as I paid for it but its all result of them just not wanting to work.  It was all about going home for the night.  She also mentioned they only have  minutes til closing...nnJust a horrible, angry feeling leaving this place.  Sprint needs to overhaul this store BAD."
0,Stay far away from here!! I had braces put on by them and a few years later my teeth are still messed up! They screwed up my mouth so bad that every dentist Ive gone to refuses to touch me until I have jaw surgery due to Western Dentals negligence. Then they sent me to collections for no reason which it has since been taken care of but that just shows how  negligent they are!
0,"If I was rating the success of the surgeon I would rate  starts.  However the service at the front desk is why I only give them  stars.  nnTrying to keep it brief, after a years of pain and dodging getting my wisdom teeth out I finally ask for a referral.  I choose this place because it DID have good reviews and I checked multiple sites and decided this was the place to have the procedure Ive been putting off for the better part of  years.  The dentist was great and after the consultation I said okay lets do it! You can imagine the let down I feel when the receptionist just said oh this is not covered.  She said this without doing any kind of checking into or looking up anything.  She just asked my insurance and I told her and that was her response.  So I was confused and said how do you figure? and she just said I work here, I know its not covered and I was kind of shocked about her matter of factness about it.  So since I was pretty much tired of being in pain on a daily basis I ask about the costs and she is helpful, I guess, while telling me its going to be about ,. for me.  SO of course we have to say we need to call back.  We decide its necessary and pay for it on a credit card that we took out specially for this....  Anyway I get the surgery, everything is fine, months pass..... Then what happens?  We get a  check in the mail as a refund... because guess what? IT WAS COVERED!  The only portion that was not covered was the anesthesia as I decided to go under.  nnSO yeah, I would not recommend this place on that basis, unless you want to get screwed around.  Then by all means!"
0,"I generally try to stay away writing low ratings, especially when Ive only ordered from a place once. That said, the stracciatella gelato my favorite flavor of gelato was completely flavorless, and I threw most of it out. Storebought gelato would have been much better, and maybe they should consider that as an option instead of whatever theyre currently doing. My recommendation would be to get a cold coffee or smoothie to sip on while youre walking around, and skip on the gelato. nnIm giving Zio two stars simply because its the only place I found serving gelato in Vegas. Enjoying good gelato on a hot day is one of lifes simple pleasures in my book, and the fauxItaly vibe in Vegas combined with the hot desert sun provides a perfect atmosphere for it. Maybe some of their other flavors taste better, but Im not likely to try again after my first experience."
0,"Being new to Arizona and unfamiliar with Mimis I decided to stop in with my family for some mediocre food and rude, slow and overall lousy service. The ambiance is a throwback from some era when it may have been stylish but today appears old and tired. We will never darken their doors again."
0,"If only zero star was available. After one sip of my drink, I wanted to leave ordered a Coke but got a flat diet soda. I am allergic to diet soda. The food was just plainly bad.

Not here."
0,"I work in the service industry and I converse with many people daily. After hearing many opinions about Harvest, we decided to try it during restaurant week. The person I went with had been before and enjoyed it, so it was my first time...and I was hopeful. They were really busy, to be expected. But let me just say this, restaurant week is your chance to shine and impress people who are in town for business, new to town, or first timers in general. You should be at the top of your game. Ill cut to the chase...our waitress was SUPER awkward, our drinks we really good, my food I had pork belly over jalapeno cornbread was barely warm and stale..also lacked flavor, my partners food she had beef ribs was hot but extremely salty. My dessert was a chocolate espresso thing that looked and tasted like a chocolate pudding snack pack. Ill give them a second shot someday maybe, but Im not in a rush to do so, or recommend Harvest to anyone."

0,How does this location stay open? Lines are not that long and it takes forever to get up to the front to pay. Theres always issues with the printers downstairs. Ive come here a few times and its not good for my blood pressure. I went here once to get my resumue copied on their paper and my printer had skewed the printing due north a bit.

Can you do that for me?nnHER No. nnME Can you do anything?nna customer to my right starts laughingnnI wound up using the whiteout tape myself and made copies.

0,"Not super impressed by this place. I ordered something simple. A cheese omelet, it was OK at best. Potatoes GREASY! This place gets good reviews and maybe I should have ordered one of the benes to get a better taste for the place but I also think a simple omlete should be stellar and it was not. I may try it again but I doubt it. There are better places IMO.nService was good though and they were very nice."

0,"Wouldve given a  star for the new and posh rooms and almost smoke free casino.  However, the customer service dragged their score done.  Arrived at Saturday,  around noon to check in.  It was a little early but the front desk assured us  couples with  rooms that while the rooms were ready yet, they were being cleaned.  It wouldnt take more than  hours to be done.  All sounded fair since we were early.  Walked around in Crystal and only  friend got the call letting her know that her room was ready.  That was  pm.  We all went to front desk to pick up the key  with her and check on the status of the rest of the rooms.  At this point only  out  rooms were ready.  We went and chilled in the  rooms while waiting for the rest to be done.  nnAn hour went by and we called front desk to check the status only to be put on hold for  minute before being told that they were trying to connect with housekeeping for the status and will call us.  Another or  went by, and I got impatient.  I went outside and found a housekeeping staff and told her I needed to know if my room which was right next door was ready.  She opened the door to check and sure enough it was a mess.  Housekeeping hadnt got to it yet, and it was  pm.  The lady began working on it immediately. nnI went back to my friends room next door and got a call from front desk saying housekeeping is working on my room.  Duh... I knew that.  I was the one who dragged housekeeping over to clean the room.    minutes later, I sent my husband to front desk to complain, and he called to tell me that he got our room key and it was finally ready.  Right after I spoke to him, front desk called to ask me if they should send my key up to my friends room.  Duh... My husband already go the keys.  Again, that was almost  pm!!!  We got there at noon.  nnWhat is wrong with Aria customer service?   No communication between front desk and housekeeping  not prioritizing to clean the rooms that guests already tried to check in to.  My conclusion is that MGM group is trying to save a few bucks by not hiring enough cleaning staff and training front desk staff properly.  nnI dont think well be staying at Aria any time soon until they get their act together and up the customer service standards.  nnSuch a beautiful hotel.   What a waste..."
0,"To start off, I will say the food here was wonderful. I got a  inch pizza which was a lot bigger than I thought it would be and it had green peppers and onions, my boyfriend got the  inch joeys special. Both of these pizzas were delicious. We also had gotten the garlic knots with cheese and they have some killer marinara sauce. Everything was fresh and delicious. Their pizza crusts are also awesome.nnAs for the bad part. The service sucks and I would highly recommend doing a pick up and bringing it home if you go later on in the day after  pm. Our waitress was your typical  year old college chick who would rather spend time talking to the other servers in the back and we barely saw her. I finally got sick of waiting for her to come get my card to swipe it so I brought it to the front counter and the manager came over to take care of it and who comes running out to take care of me? To say the least, the tip was not good.nnAlso, my boyfriend got a beer. The beer expired in . They REALLY need to check their stock. Then his second beer got to foamy and spilled and the waitress came over with our food and we mentioned the beer spilled but she never got us additional napkins or anything.nnSo again, awesome food and kudos to the pizza cookers but the service sucks otherwise. I went later on in the day however so the daytime crew before  pm may be better.nnAs for the restaurant itself, its nice inside. Our table was wobbly which was kind of annoying but no big deal and was fairly  clean. The bathroom had no hand soap in it though but otherwise it was really clean.nnAlso, go for the nights that have deals on the pizza, we got  pizza and then the second was  off. This is for montues nights."
0,"I had Ramen Sora for the first time last night and I was not impressed.

Even though there were tables available. nnWe had an order of gyoza and the deluxe miso ramen  deluxe shio ramen.. nThe gyoza was not good to me it had a weird almost iodine taste to it.. nThe miso broth was nice.. very deep and creamy..way better than any other miso broth Ive tasted.. also I did like the chashu.. very melt in your mouth good and they dont skimp out on it in their deluxe ramen..  I liked the chewy consistency of the noodles but personally, I am more of a fan of thinner noodles.. My ramen also had that same weird taste to it.. I think it was the taste of the menma.. So I must not like the taste of their bamboo...  The tamago didnt really have any seasoned taste to it..nThe service was not good at all.. Our waitress never checked up on us.. She never even refilled my water. BOO!nnSo as of now Ramen Sora is at the bottom of my list Sorry SORA, My cousins name is Sora, HAHA but you need to step up your game. pppnnIf I come back here I will probably get the miso ramen with no menma  no tamago but with extra chashu and hopefully the service will be better!!!"
0,"After watching Kick ass at the near by Harkins, my buddy and I decided to walk down the street and grab a bite to eat. I was being treated for my birthday it was actually on Thursday the nd so I was hoping for a good time. Last time we split a Chicago pan pizza which was really huge and good. The greeter took us right to our table near the bar and in perfect view of the start of the Laker game. nnOur server was a great help in narrowing down our choices as we both wanted to try something new besides the pizza. I ordered the chicken parm and he had the cheese tortellini. Both came out after about  minutes which seemed longer given that I had missed breakfast but was worth it when I saw the food. Nice looking chicken breaded and baked till crispy not soggy. They also did not skip on the cheese which was a great thing in my book as I am a big cheese freak LOL.nnEverything was great until I tasted the pasta sauce. Instead of mumm, it was more like What the hell is this! All I can say is yuck! The sauce tasted like a can of tomato sauce, mixed with one of those season packets from a pack of chicken flavored top ramen. Now I do not like to send my food back seen to many of those caught on camera specials on fox I guess but I had to this time. I asked the waitress if this is the main sauce they use for all their dishes and she said yes except for the pizza. Thank goodness for that was my thought. nnThat left me with very limited choices so I decided to just finish my meal with a order of mozzarella sticks. The chicken parm was removed and was taken off our bill which was great but left me with the birthday blues. After about the second cheese stick I was ready to go. My buddy was buzzing like a happy little bee after the two beers and a double shot of Irish whiskey he had so we paid the check and left.nnNow I know this place does one thing and does it really well and that is Pizza. As long as that is what your order then you are golden, but try to stray into the path of the unknown and you to will be sorry."
0,"RUDE, rude bouncers, rude people. This place was packed to the gills, you could not walk or hardly breath. no one lets you pass and people push you, this male bouncer actulaly pushed my female friend WTF!!!. There are vip tables in each corner of the club so the dance floor is really compact, there is a techno house room and the other room was playing s music, all in all not the best experience. But the music in the main room was good and there were  free shot girls walking around earlier in the night.."
0,"Hadnt been in a long time so went back to see Chihuly in the Garden, and remembered why I wasnt impressed the first time around. On the plus side it is very well maintained. But for me it was too much so. I think I saw as many little placards describing every plant as I saw plants. It feels far more like an exhibit to me than an honest garden of any kind.nnI liked the diversity of Arizona regions they have on display, and there is some nice historical information, but overall for far less money you can get out and experience some of the great trails all around our state. Take the time and see it for real instead of in a plantzoo."
0,"UGHthe name of this place is just awful.  I would not have chosen this place if I were choosing, but I did not get to choose.  I was in a large group and we waited for EVER to get ineven with a reservation.nnI am very picky with Mexican food and to me this was very subpar.  It is in the Hard Rock hotel which is cool and it is close to the gift shopso there is some really cool shopping to be done in there.nnThe chips and salsa were good, but my meal was blah.  I would not go back to the Pink TacoI just do not swing that way."
0,"Wish I could say more about this place because I live so close! BUT of the items Ive had during  visits lentil soup, house salad, feta pita, hummus, baba ganoush, shawarma, tabouli, falafel...ALL MEDIOCRE. Shawarma was not authentic it was a shredded up beef steak. The dips tasted like they could a been from a can. Its inexpensive but disappointing. Prob wont go back."
0,"This shopping center is pathetic.  I worked in a TV studio that was here for a year, and the owner apparently kicked out the few tenants he had to make room for all the new businesses that were coming in.  They never did.  They lost a La Salsa, an Orange Julius, and a few other business I cant remember.  For what?  Empty space.  I just saw a sushi joint opened where La Salsa used to be, but I cant imagine it lasting long there.  The rest of the shopping center is still pretty empty.  So sad.nnThe parking situation is even worse.  Ive had multiple experiences where my validated parking ticket didnt meet the strict criteria of the parking attendant.  Here I am in line with a bunch of cars behind me, and this guy wont open the gate.  Dude, you work at a parking garage for a living youre not God.  The attendant actually said to me tonight, Do you know who youre dealing with?   Wow.nnTry not to ever go to Neonopolis."
0,"Been in the food industry for  years. My dad . Dont waste your time or money at this location. infant daughter was asleep in stroller so we were forced to the patio. No big deal... we were the ONLY ones there to eat. Took a while for someone to come out of the back to seat us though. Sat on patio for  minutes... never were talked to by anyone. In the meantime some others were seated.. given drinks.. and probably had orders taken... we were forgotten. After seating  next to us and they were served, We quietly stood up and left. I dont like to make a scene you just end up like the other reviewer I just read... dont want hair in my potato. Lesson learned. Avoid this dillons till they hire someone with more experience it customer service. Never even got to try the food but based on the reviews Im glad we saved our money and went to logans roadhouse."
0,"Come to this place if you love stuckup bouncers who refuse you for no reason whatsoever! My boyfriend and I were on a guestlist which ended at am and arrived at exactly .am. We were late, fair enough, we didnt have to be let in on the guestlist. What we didnt expect was to be flatout refused entry despite being two welldressed, polite and sober people who were fully willing to pay full price to get in. This was on a Tuesday when the place was dead with no line to be seen anywhere. A pile of wank. Dont go"
0,"Butterfields, oh butterfields.  Tsssk... tsssk....  nnIm just going to explain my experience there and then talk about the food.  So listen up... nnWalked in.... there was a wait on a Wed morning for about  mins for two people.  nThe decor was weird.  There was a flying pancake mural on the ceiling over the lobby.  Really cheesy considering that the place is nicely designed on the outside.  The other light fixtures were painting on waffles, what the heck.  I get it, breakfast themed, but it was just weird, it didnt fit with the rest of the restaurant.  nnI ordered a cup of joe.  My husband didnt. The coffee girl who came by to pour MY cup of joe, not so great.  The coffee cup was clearly on my side of our tiny table and she turns and speaks only to my husband and asks, caffeinated or decaf.  Hello... um, Im right here and the coffee cup is in front of me.  At what point did I marry Christian Grey  or Edward?  My husband reached over and pushed my cup even further right in front of me and ever so graciously replies, My WIFE ordered the coffee.  She turns and I said caffeinated and she pours and walks away.  Ummmm... thanks.  nnThe waitress not the coffee girl is great.  Attentive, she built some rapport by complementing my glasses, my coffee was always topped off by her and water glass was never empty.  The only thing that I wasnt appreciative of is that she dropped the bill off at the table in the middle of our meal.  IT wasnt even as if we were almost done, but at the time, I felt that I was being rushed.  No bueno.nnAs to the food   I have been on no carbs no sugar for a month.   A plain ol waffle shouldve knocked my socks off.    That is all I ordered, was a regular waffle for the crazy price of ..  It had holes in some of the spots where clearly not enough batter was used.  The waffle also had no flavor, not even a hint of vanilla.  Very lackluster for the price.   I ordered a side of bacon extra crispy.  Though the bacon looked welldone, it was still soft and surprisingly lacked flavor.  nn My husband ordered the pancake stack with berriesmarscaponevanilla creme.  IT was very pretty but so overpoweringly sweet because of all the vanilla creme sauce.  You couldnt really taste the pancake.  It wasnt bad, but it wasnt amazingly good either for almost ..  For almost . he ordered a side of corned beef hash with onions.  Tiny little portion for the cost and I would say they need to rename it ONIONS with hash and corn beef.  nnCoffee was .what?  I know.  nnWhat it boils down to, is that their pancackes and waffles are lackluster and they use toppings as a way to make them good.  nnAll in all, my husband said it right,  Its an overpriced Dennys."

0,"I was in Vegas several days to see shows, visit friends, and casino hop.  I had heard about this show or shall I say experience in the press and thru mutual friends.  I was looking forward to a greatunique evening.  The space is very unique, chic chic, glitzy and smoky with piped in smoke for the ooohaaah ambiance.  Its an impressive entry and first impression.  There are three shows with different content in all three.  I stayed for all three.  Booze is pricey.  In fact everything in that hotel is pricey. Martinis  bucks.  nNow.........here we go.........my biggest complaint was the show.  I have seen numerous Cirque shows, cabaret shows, dinner theatre shows, etc.   This is not my first rodeo as they say.  This show or should I say all three shows lacked direction, had no punch, the talent was mediocre, the comedy was basically non existent......in that I didnt laugh but maybe a couple of times.  Some performers were phoning it in Piff the Magic Dragon others were just plain dull.  The calibre of talent was that of  those auditioning for Americas Got Talent........except that they dont.  Actually, I might be being a bit harsh.  I think the talent could be better if it were for a much better director.  They tout this as a speakeasy, interactive experience, but it could have been a fantastic experience.  Instead i found it to be lukewarm at best.  The show and talent do not rise up the impressive club surroundings itself.  nPricey, underwhelming, and not worth the hype.  Save your ."
0,"This is the worst clubbing experience Ive ever had. The dance floor is tiny, so they wont let anyone on. You have to sneak past the incredibly rude bouncers in order to dance. Worse, a ring of bouncers armed with flashlights shoves an evermoving herd of hapless clubgoers ordering them to keep moving. Where would you like us to go? I asked two separate bouncers, who said they didnt know. Thats because theres nowhere to go. They just keep the crowd moving to conceal the fact that theres nothing there and no room for it. Too many people is not unusual for a Vegas club, nor is a long line to get in, but for their bizarre approach to crowd control, I give this one an F. Stay away. There are plenty of places to dance in Las Vegas and even more to get drunk. I will say the video screens were cool, but youre not going the DJ was typical and I feel like Ive just survived a mob trampling that was completely unnecessary. Not how I wanted to spend one special night in Vegas.nnNote This review was written on Christmas Eve of last year. I dont know why it didnt post, but reading it again reminded me of how crazy awful this place was. I dont even know if its still around, but if it is, avoid avoid avoid."
0,"DONT WAIST YOUR TIME!!!!!The only restaurant still open at the MGM after  PM. My sister and I ordered a salad and it was over whelmed with raw onion.  So all I could taste was onion.  So I told the waitress that the salad was over whelmed with onion and I couldnt eat it.  She had a attitude so I just decided not to reorder anything.  Then the manager came and try to fix the situation and offered me something else.  So I decided to get chicken noodle soup.  Thats pretty basic it hard to mess up soup so I thought.  It was flavor less and there was veins threw out the chicken.   I was done at that point and grossed out.  You would think that a restaurant of that stature would make sure there food was Delicious.  The whole time we were eating the waitress was giving us attitude.  Big mistake,  I would have left you a great tip after all your not the cook idiot!"
0,"To bad I cant do a  on this salon ! I went in as a walk in , which they stated they accept , was told to come back in a hour. I came back exactly one hour later, sat down after checking back in , then was ignored for another half hour . When I got up to leave a nail tech at the back of the salon started yelling across the whole salon  telling me that someone just opened up. It would of been nice if she had walked over to talk to me, or better yet let me know when I came back that they were running behind,  instead  of letting me just sit there ! I could of found a nice salon in that  hours instead of waiting to be served in this dump. If you want a Nail Salon go elsewhere. This salon is not clean and their motto probably is Treatem and Streetem"
0,"If I could give a  star review I would. Let me start by saying the pizza isnt that bad and the garlic knots are pretty good but thats about it for the positive remarks...this place was SO bad that they took about  minutes not exaggerating to get the drinks and not a SINGLE refill was delivered by them, I actually got my entire tables refills the whole time we were there and the pizza took every bit of  minutes to get to us and before you ask it was not busy at all...us and  other tables doesnt constitute that long of a wait for  pizzas and a calzone. Oh and one more thing to add  different groups walked out waiting for their togo orders while we waited for our order because they felt the wait was too long. nnSo in short save your money and just go eat at ANY other place unless youre ok with waiting minutes for a mediocre pizza at best."
0,Always super messy in the store and dressing rooms make me feel like Im going to catch a disease. I think reflooring this store would drastically change the experience. Also more friendly employees. Ive been to way nicer Fs.

Went here cuz our white cab driver told us it was good. lols I think the food here leaning a tiny bit towards fusion. Anyways it is the nicest Pho restaurant Ive seen compared to Vancouver."

Salmon was perfect as were the scallops only  had the pork belly... this caused some interesting interplay and the hangar steak was cooked per spec and well received.nnFor  of  of us, the dessert comprised too much cake, not enough flavor.  The crew thought the sour cream was lame.nnLast, if you have an open kitchen, one would hope the staff played their part.  We are used to the Roys in SF nd  Mission.  The chefs we could see looked like those booted from Hells Kitchen... slow yet ineffective.  This might explain why there was no decent pacing to the meal.nnSadly, this has erased Roys LV from our dining circuit, but Roys SF remains a winner."

0,"BEWARE of GIFT CERTIFICATES Received a gift certificate for the Fullerton spa and was told that is was good at both locations, it even says it on the gift certificate.  So when I tried to use it in Vegas they said they would not allow me to use it.  I asked for an explanation and the women just kept saying No no good here.  It was weird how she suddenly started to speak broken English and could only repeat the same thing over and over.  What a scam.  Extremely disappointing."
0,"Honestly, a very big disappointment.The optician was recommended by a friend of mine, as they had Oliver Peopels frames which I am a big fan of.nAnyways, explanation of why I have given only  stars to this placenI had booked a sight test which went great. The optician was polite and explained everything very well. Took about  minutes and voila done! And I was very happy to hear that it was free as NHS cover a sight test every  years.nThen they offered to also to try on some glasses. As I said I went there for Oliver Peoples, as I have had these frames before and I absolutely love them. The price of the frame did not surprise me, you pay for quality. However, when I asked if they had similar styles that are a bit more economical, they didnt even have one pair to show me!  Also when it went to the actual lens prices my eyes nearly popped out. They were basically the same amount as the frames! So I left the opticians with the intention to sleep on it and come back the next morning.nI was actually on the way there next morning as I figured I would not find a cheaper option anywhere else, but on the way there I popped into Specsavers on North Bridge. And surprise, surprise I found nearly the same model, but approximately x cheaper. So obviously I went for these! So I gave them the prescription I had gotten the day before in  , but as they couldnt quite understand it they phoned up   to explain it to them. On the phone the receptionist Im guessing had told the lady at Specsavers that I have to go to their opticians to take care of my bill Ehm, I was quite dumbstruck, as the optician had clearly said the day before that NHS would cover my eye test and I hadnt ordered anything. In any way, I felt absolutely embarrassed!!! After a quick chat it turned out that I didnt have to go back to settle no bills doh, but they didnt even properly explain the prescription to the optician in Specsavers! nSo long story short, I will not be back in   anytime soon."
0,"Falling Fast.  nnIve been going to Radio Maria since it opened and have likely gone for dinner for the last time.  The menu, once a delightful mix of cultures and influences, and the sort of place where there was nothing bad on the menu, has been getting progressively smaller and less capable as the years have gone on.  nnDrinks are good, Tapas is meh and pricey, dinner...no...and pricey.  We went last week and I ordered salmon which arrived with sweet potato chips  and a huge fried egg on top.  The fish was okay at best and the odd attempts at nouvelle cuisine were amusing  but tasteless in every sense of the word.nnIn a market as competitive as CU, I dont see how they can continue this based on anything but location and alcohol.  Pity to see an old favorite fall this far."
0,"Stayed here for  night since I was on my way home to San Jose,CA from Tucson, AZ, I decided to stay in Phoenix for  night so I could go to a DBacks game, this Motel  isnt a far drive to Chase Field, they put me in a room with  twin beds when I requested on my reservation that I wanted a queen size bed, I asked them why I got a room with two twin beds and they told me they couldnt give me one because they were doing some kind of work to the vacant rooms with queen beds, I was very disappointed about this since Im a tall guy, I need to sleep at least on a queen size bed. Their prices are great which is the main reason why I stayed here but I doubt I will be back at this location."
0,So our last time we visited we had a hair in the teriyaki chicken bowl  were told that our next order would be on the house.

Just to check in, I had to leave the bowling alley. nnIn the bar area, the entertainment games are very out dated. If youre into Golden Tee, dont waste your time.

0,"Go Daddy is hit or miss which is such a shame. They have the domain game down perfectly. Meaning they are the most well priced on the web and have the best back end UI for managing your purchases etc.  I own a few hundred with them. nnHeres where they fall short. Their hosting support and domain support isnt very good. I once had an issue that I called in a dozen times in  months for. Not to mention, the latest string of technical support issues that had me calling in  times in a day for something as simple as How do I create a new FTP user password that works for my IT guy? Yeah that took  days to resolve effectively.  Whats worse is that I even had a guy tell me to call back between am and pm to get someone who could help me better after I was on the phone with him for  mins. I am not sure if that was a blessing or a curse. nnIf you can find an alternative option for hosting or domain support I would go with it. Too often every representative tells you something different and youll surely end up frustrated and yelling at the world after a few transfers and call backs. nn If you just need to buy and sell domains. Theyre perfect."

Despite the restaurant slowing down, our waiter pretty much disappeared. Whenever he would come by, we asked him to bring out my daughters birthday cake with candles that we had brought to celebrate. He told us at least twice that it was on its way...then  minutes went by. Both my kids are melting down, my  year old is crying on her birthday, the grandparents are falling asleep and I couldnt even find the waiter.nnHe finally reappeared and I asked him for the cake back and the check cause we had to go.

0,"Unfortunately, I had a bad experience at Desert Dermatology.nnI moved to Las Vegas about  months ago, and was running low on my topical cream used to treat occasional dermatitis breakouts, which I had gotten from my previous dermatologist in California. So I decided not to wait until the last minute and made an appointment here. nnWhen you call to schedule an appointment, you get their automated phone system. The first time I waited  minutes for someone to come on the line, the second time I waited  minutes. On the day of my appointment, the wait wasnt too long after filling out the new patient paperwork. I would say that I was in and out of there in about  minutes or so. nnI saw Dr. Isaac Gier. Although he listened and answered all of my questions, everything seemed really rushed. He gave me a prescription for pills and a cream, and told me to come back in two months for a follow up. I had a really bad reaction to the medication. The pills made me feel very sick, even though I followed the directions and took them with food twice a day. After  days of being miserable, I stopped taking them and immediately felt better. I guess I cant really blame the doctor for this since everyone has different reactions to medication. nnThe topical cream was the worst part. This may be TMI, but after  weeks of using it, my face and neck broke out in a very itchy rash. I spent some time on Google and researched this cream. Turns out that it was given a black box warning supposedly the FDAs strongest warning and many people have suffered from its side effects. Wish I knew about that beforehand! I was so miserable that I went to see my primary care doctor who thankfully prescribed me medicine to clear up what I had. Even she told me that this cream was bad news, it should not be used, and is most likely the cause of what happened to me. nnI dont understand why Dr. Gier would even prescribe this cream to his patients? Very disappointing and makes me wonder if he cares about his patients at all. Lesson learned I suppose. From now on, Im just going to see my primary care doctor with my issues and let her decide what is best. nnIm not sure if things would have been different if I saw the other doctors here  Dr. Langford or Dr. Leposavic? Who knows. One thing is for sure, I definitely WILL NOT be coming back here!!"

There are much better burgers in town and I dont think this place is any good at all."
0,"This place was really overhyped. They advertise themselves as having a vegetarian menu, then when you go they dont mention anything unless you do. We told them we had a show to go to and they said that  hours was sufficient time, failing to tell us that it was not enough time for the tasting menu. Our meal was rushed, and we had to take the main course in a doggie bag, and run to our show, missing the first  minutes. Quite pretentious, the food is decent but I could get quality like that for a third of the price in NYC."

How great right?!  Skoti as his card said which also says hes the marketing and social media manager for the Ainsworth told us he could get us bottle service at the hottest nightclub for that night, the same one our waitress suggested go figure!....off the property.  And not only that but it would be COMPED!  We would just have to pay tax and gratuity only  to HIM, not the club.  And just to make sure we got in, he was going to leave the Hard Rock, take a cab with us, accept payment on our behalf outside the nightclub...all out of kindness and great service.nnApparently, we look like idiots.  When we started asking questions he threw out, this is Vegas, this is how it works, you pay me then I pay them  no one has questioned this deal before.nnThankfully, we were born at night, but not the night before, so we decided to finish what we could and get the check and go.  Only now, the nice waitress was gone, she didnt even make eye contact with us not even to bring the water and drink refills we had been waiting half and hour for...we now had some angry server who had zero patience for us trying to split the bill to pay with cash.  Sadly, we hauled ass out of there and cringed every time we had to walk by the rest of our trip.  I hope someone from the Paige Group in NY sees this and realizes they have an employee who is tainting their Vegas outpost by trying to take money under the table from guests."
0,"Have you ever eaten somewhere that the experience was just so bad, that you had to try it again to make sure it wasnt just you?  Then when you went back, it was exponentially worse?  Then about a year later,  you decided What the heck, lets give them one more shot! only to have an experience that was even worse?  This makes you an idiot.  And you have company, my friend.nnI should have known the first time I went to Best China, when I asked if I could have the porkfried rice without onions, I was told to just pick them out.  At first, I thought that the very, very quiet man was just joking.  He was not.  Experience went downhill from there.nnThe next time, the entire order was wrong and had onions in everything when I asked for no onions.  We just smiled and laughed about it afterwards.nnTonight...  I went in before the rest of the family and tried to order drinks and the conversation went like thisnnMe  Do you have Sierra Mist? nQuiet man  No.nMe  What do you have?nQuiet man SodanMe  What kind of soda?nQuiet man Sprite.nMe grinning ...ooookay, I will have one of those.  Do you have juice?nQuiet man No.nMe grinning again  I will just have  waters then for the family and one Sprite.nQuiet man turns and leaves.  Brings back Sprite only.  We see later that they carry pink lemonade.nnPork skewers arrive  minutes before anything else arrives at the table looking like they were put on the fire  months ago and never left.  They were charred beyond any recognition.  The food that did finally arrive was, lets just say not good.nnCalifornia has the  Strike rule.  Baseball has the  Strike rule.  I should get benched from dining out for making the completely idiotic choice to give them the third opportunity.nnBest China...  Maybe they put out their Best China, but with the dishes that are served on them, they might want to just consider paper plates."

0,"This is a low budget high priced store. Superstore? Not really. They dont have a huge selection and then they direct you to their website. If I wanted to buy something online then I would have bought it online! They also have no return policy, which for a mostly online store, strikes me as a bad practice. The store itself is dusty and disheveled, with badly designed window units. Davids Bridal seems high class compared to this. However, they do have a good clearance section. Its in the section of the store where the broken display items and torn signs are."
0,"A bunch of lazy people! My brother and I Yelped the place and said it was open till PM. We arrive at Note OPEN light was on!! and the waitresshostess says theyre closed already and that last call was at !

It never even was stated anywhere that last call was at !"
0,"Checkin went OK even though they raised our rate after we changed from  weeks prior.  Very difficult to connect to WiFi even with support. Left Saturday morning for the day while the maid carts were in the hallway.  Came back to an unmade room.  We called down and at least asked for some towels and was told maid service is gone for the day come get them yourself.  Since we didnt have maid service we also didnt have any more shampoo for the next day.  We turned our survey card in at the front desk but were pretty sure they just threw it away.  Sent customer service an email after no response from our survey card and was told basically sorry about that.  Needless to say, no more Red Roof Inn in Phoenix!!"
0,"This place sucks. I went a few years ago, so if I go back, Ill provde an update. One of my friends made a big deal about it so we gave in and went. Big disappointment. The ambiance is great and refelective of the Asian vibe, but as a club, it sucked. It was more to me a place where you go to be seen, you know, a place that you brag about being at to all your friends. I wasnt impressesd. I dont care how many celebrities party here, the club was still wack."
0,In my opinion Middle Eastern food that is of high quality is by far the hardest thing to find in this town.nnI only came to this place because I saw another reviewer mentioned it in the same sentence as Haji Baba. To even talk about this place in the same sentence is an insult. Gyro meat was terrible and the Schwarma was totally dry.nnIf you want quality Middle Eastern food you have to go to Tempe or Scottsdale. Haji Baba or Byblos in Tempe or Mijana in Scottsdale.
0,"How do you screw up oatmeal?!  Quick service was the only positive.  There was a foreign object in my ramekin of raisins.  The oatmeal was lukewarm at best and the consistency was suspicious. I realize you sort of check your expectations of fine dining at the TSA check but its oatmeal.  With all the other choices in this airport, I will go elsewhere next time."
0,"I have been waiting to eat at E for months since it is typically not in our budget We finally went for Restaurant Week and were super disappointed!nnFirst atmosphere....I am not sure what type of restaurant Emeril is attempting to create.  The servers are in jeans and plaid shirts, the restaurants decor is that of a s steakhouse,  the food is a complete hodgepodge, and it is really expensive given the fact that it is Charlotte.  The server said that Emeril is focusing this restaurant on being a the best fresh seafood place since Emeril felt that was lacking.  It was all very confusing.nnSecond, the service was subpar.  The server was MIA throughout most of the meal.  We were there for two hours and I only had one cocktail, because by the time he came around to ask if I wanted another drink he was gathering our entree plates.  When he did grace us with his presence, he would say yeah that is good when asked about a dish we asked about five dishes.  Needless to say they were not!nnThe restaurant week menu was terrible, which forced us to go off and order from the regular menu.  The waiter said the octopus salad was good.  Ok, sure it is different we will try it out.  IT WAS HORRIBLE.  There were too many flavor combinations that did not work in harmony and the octopus was tough and rubbery.  If EMERIL is trying to make this a fresh seafood place he at least should live up to that expectation.  The couple we were with stayed with the restaurant week menu and ordered gumbo for the first dish.  I thought Emeril BAMed things up with heat and flavor it was liking eating porridge.  It looked like porridge and tasted like porridge.nnI ordered the scallops ..  I received  small not diver scallops again Emeril if you are going to boast that you are the best fresh seafood place live up that hype.  The swiss chard was cooked very well and the sauce was an excellent accompaniement, but again . for  scallops....seriously?nThe couple with us ordered the etoufee that looked like mush with a few shrimp on top of it.  It was extremely bland and literally looked like a lean cuisine meal out of the microwave.nnAll four of us were horribly disappointed in our meal and service.  I have a feeling Emeril would have been highly disappointed as well.  We all imagined what he would have said had those meals gone before him at the judges table on Top Chef!"
0,"This Filibertos was not as yummy as other ones. I dont know if it is just a difference in cooks but the food just didnt taste that good. This was the closest one to my work I now have found other Mexican food restaurants by my work. Dont want to go back to this location again. I would gladly go to other locations though. Filibs makes for great drunk, and hungover, food!"
0,"I had lunch with two girlfriends today before catching an afternoon movie.  I was completely taken aback by the prices and just couldnt get past this.  I mean seriously   for a kale salad wrap?  Add chicken and you are at !!!???  For a wrap and a lttle side of fruit?  It tasted fine, though a little dry, but nothing close to special or memorable.  I cant justify it  and dont anticipate a return visit in my future.  Sorry, but there are other fresh and healthy options in the area with realistic pricing."
0,"Lol! What a joke paid  for a tiny burger paid  for small fries that were crusty and old,  then I paid  cent upgrade for order of onion rings so almost  lol,   thin pieces barely any onion just batter.

Not good business after given me day old fries made me pay to get fresh onion rings only to get  slivers for . crazy how cheap this world has come too.  The place makes it look like some real American food false advertisement! Lol The owner should be ashamed"
0,"Was here a few times. Fun to walk around and see some of the crazy stuff. The novelty wore off the second visit. Have yet to buy anything that is actually good. Bought a chocolate bar that wasnt sweet. Who makes chocolate that isnt sweet? The store was very disorganized. Seemed to be no order to anything. If you havent been there, go check it out for yourself. Could be a fun experience."
0,"After arriving in Vegas, we went straight here to run in, hopefully see someone, and leave. They were taping the show when we arrived, the bouncer told us it would be  min and wed get in.  So we waited, and we waited, and we waited.  Im from Kansas...its hot in the summer yes, but this is the desert.  I am SO glad theres the guy with the pop up shop because I drank  bottles of water before we got to go in  hours later.  We saw Rick walk by SUPER quick and thats it.  We heard they dont like to be seen anymore.  There was so many people in there you couldnt see much...kind of a waste of time."
0,Pad Thai is ok...its actually the only thing that was worth having in my limited experience. I couldnt believe how much salt they had put in my red curry. Calamari fries...Any restaurant would do better fries. The batter kept on coming off the calamari. Would not return.
0,"I used to always go here for tires until my mechanic noticed my tires were the incorrect size.  Back to Discount I go to correct the problem, and they blamed me. I was told that I must have chosen the smaller tires to save  bucks a tire.  I ended up having to spend a lot of money on five new tires my spare is a full size as well three weeks before Christmas. I wrote the company a letter to tell them how wrong I felt the entire experience was, and I never heard anything back.  I will not be going here for future tire needs."
0,"a complete insult to italian cuisine. the calamari was fairly decent however only served with some trashy ranch dressing.. and thats where the good ends...nThe green tea had NO FLAVOR. The ciabatta bread was COLD. not room temp. out of a refrigerator cold!nI ordered a special this evening... pasta with breaded shrimp with their specialty sunrise sauce marinaraalfredo mixed together... The sauce tasted like baby food, and the pasta combined with it tasted like water. The shrimp were a good size but there were only a few, considering the . price... also, for this price, soup or salad should be included. not . more. The shrimp were overcooked and  I bit into one and had to spit it out into my napkin... something I NEVER EVER DO regardless of how something tastes.. It had a foul STRONG fishy taste that was just absolutely nauseating. I alerted the waitress to this and she seemed concerned but offered nothing in compensation. My family members ordered other nonimpressive meals.. the vitos italian sausage sandwiches were also cold, and had      slimy boiled peppers in onions.  My dads Chicken Picatta looked like it was made with frozeninabag chicken breasts from the grocery store.. again, absolutely insulting considering the menu price. Waitress was unpleasant and visibly angry about something going on with her coworkers.  Completely unprofessional. Lets hope that foul shrimp doesnt come back to haunt me in a few hours!"
0,"My hair still looks awful thanks to the butcher McKenzie. nnThe owner did NOT handle the situation well when I went into the salon aka, ghetto strip mall location, do not be fooled by the pictures.

0,"Ordered edamame...never came...server then forgot about us and the sushi chef had to come take our order much appreciated. Ordered beer...the server forgot...

The staff was very nice but were extremely forgetful and non responsive.  After voicing my frustration and asking to just get our food boxed up, we ended up getting one of our rolls that we ordered on the house.  I thought this was a nice gesture, but hardly enough to make up for this frustrating experience.  I would have understood the lack of service if they were incredibly busy, but they were not.  They just seemed to be understaffed for a saturday night.   It is a shame because the terriyaki steak and the chirashi bowl we ordered were both very good.  I will not be returning to this place and will be eating the rest of my dinner that was boxed upat home after i make some rice.  Assuming that i dont forget!"
0,"A lot of experience was dampened by the service.  We had a reservation and were seated relatively quickly, but it was a fair bit before our waiter showed.  Then a longer wait for menus, a very long wait for drinks, etc. etc.  This was earlier in the evening  the restaurant wasnt busy.  We overhead several tables making the same comment.  nnWe were excited by the concept fo the food, but found it somewhat lacking and way overpriced.  The drinks are good, but Id skip this place in favor of some of the better choices nearby."
0,"Here is the business response nnWould you consider editing your star review from Gold Touch Jewelry?nthere was a family emergency and I feel its unfair to do a star review because of that and judge the entire business and work off of an unforeseen circumstance.nnYou acknowledge you were closed and now you dont?

0,"Visited this restaurant for the first time September ,  with a Groupon.  Got seated in the dining room about PM that was mostly empty.  Dining room appears drab because its mostly bare walls. Get some pictures!  Ordered two glasses of wine. Wine came in unstemmed glass which Im not fond of but the worse part was the amount of wine in the glass.  If there was  ounces, Id be surprised and for  to  for chardonnay, its a total rip!  Ordered two dinners. One came with rice and waitress asked if wed like white or brown  we requested brown.  Dinners were ok  nothing fabulous and took way too long for the amount of people in the restaurant.  Ordered a key lime creme brulee and it was tasteless and grossly overpriced for .  When we got the tab, there was a  charge for brown rice which is pathetic when you spend  for an entree. Worse, the waitress never told us of the extra charge.  For almost a  tab before tip, definitely not worth it.  Much better food and prices around the arrowhead area.  We hear there are new owners of Satara  guys, you really need some impovement and if you keep the unstemmed glasses, please servve  a decent glass of wine."

0,"To paraphrase the late great Clara Peller Wheres the lobster?!nI am referring to the absence of edible lobster in the Lobster Mac  Cheese  that I ordered as part of our  meal for two. There were exactly  tiny pieces of cartilage from the clawpoint of the lobster I always discard this part when I eat lobster and it seems that they throw that crap in there to trick customers into thinking theres actually lobster in the dish. Even more maddening is flipping through the channels in our room upstairs and stopping on MLife TV to watch Hubert Keller himself describe the most comforting American food being his signature Lobster Mac  Cheese  he then chops up an entire lobster tail and tosses it in his mac  cheese skillet.nnThe Onion Soup  was oddly thick and tasted really badforyou like it was made with lots of butter. The Crab  Avocado Sphere  was pretty good, but it would be pretty hard to mess that up chilled jumbo lump crab and avocado slices. nnThe Branzino  fish was about a ounce portion and sat atop an inedible mound of salty and sour risotto barley with some random chorizo sauce that made it worse. The Kushi Oysters  were much smaller than the awesome ones we got at Sensi a week earlier, and the shuckers at Fleur get an F for leaving bits of top shell shavings in with the oyster, ruining two of the oysters.nnIf you must go to Fleur, do NOT sit on the patio like we did. The dueling piano bar entertainment  yards away is really hard on the ears in more ways than one. We endured a minute version of Barbie World and the electric pianos they use sound like  decibel cell phone ringtones. The water fountain around the corner only adds to the chaos.nnAnyways, people seem to love this restaurant, but I dont get it. I would be totally down with  per person at a tapasstyle place if the food was good. Unfortunately it isnt. I can honestly say I wouldnt eat at Fleur again even if it were free."
0,"Absolutely ridiculous...I just signed up for Yelp, just so I can leave these guys a negative review after my experience with them handling an Amazon Prime order of mine today. nnI ordered a package yesterday to be here Saturday  standard twoday shipping for Amazon Prime accounts. I was pleased to see that it was actually going to arrive today. Well, as all of these other comments show, its the same old story  shows as delivered and is not delivered. nnSo I take action and call OnTrac. Nice lady answers the phone, apologizes, says she will reach out to the driver and call me back in an hour. This was  on a Friday. She calls back at  to tell me that the driver wont be coming back until Monday. How does that help me? I ask. It doesnt, but the driver wants to go home for the weekend and hes not near your location. So can I have it delievered tomorrow then? No sir, we dont work on the weekends. At this point I really cant believe what I am hearing...nnI pay for an Amazon Prime account and expect twoday shipping. You mean to tell me that I wont get the package I ordered which I need for Monday because your driver is lazy and doesnt want to loop back around to figure out where the heck my package is? What about customer service? What about making sure youre delievering a good service? nnSo I call Amazon and they make it right by ensuring Saturday delivery with a RELIABLE carrier like UPS or FEDEX. I will have my package tomorrow no thanks to OnTrac. I filed a formal complaint with Amazon.com to remove OnTrac as a regional carrier here in Phoenix and by the looks of these reviews, I hope they start getting the message. If I had the option, I would put in my personal profile that they are never allowed to touch an order of mine ever again.nnWhatever you do, if you can avoid it, dont ever use OnTrac if you want reliable service and want your package delivered properly.nnAnd Rob A. who works with OnTrac, dont bother contacting me to ask for tracking info...nnUPDATE This review was a bit delayed due to email confirmation. Since this mishap with OnTrac, I received my package from FedEx the next day. About four days later, the other package arrived on my doorstep with a note from a neighbor not sure who saying they delivered it to the wrong address...again. We have had multiple issues with OnTrac delivering to the wrong address. To OnTrac operations, I am sorry for putting my correct address on the package exactly how it is on file with the USPS. Next time, Ill put my neighbors and maybe then I will get my package."
0,"This was our first time coming here and we were pretty excited about it. Always see the commercials and wanted to try it out.nnWas a major let down.nnThere was a crowd out the door which was fine, took us about  minutes to get seated. No Problem. Waiter was very nicewhich is I gave a bonus star.nnThe food however was a complete letdown. It was cafeteria quality at best. The salad bar was decent but I would warn people away from the shrimp topping. nnSadly quality control is pretty substandard. We noticed some funny tastes and when we inquired about it we were told that all fried food shared the same fryers  oil...really added a gross fishy taste to everything that was fried. nnI guess the biggest draw here is the steak seeing as when we left the line was wrapped all the way to the desert bar. Funny thing is, the steak wasnt that great. Guess people just enjoy the variety of food and being able to pig out as they please regardless of taste."
0,"The ONLY reason this place got two stars was because of LOCATION. Location, location, location. That and the rooms arent THAT bad once you actually get through the casino but oh my WORD. The entire place smells like old people and rotten eggs and farts. Its truly horrific. The other downside is that there arent that many options to eat, theyre pretty pathetic and the other flamingo area is lame. Again, LOCATION. Its smack in the center of the strip so its pretty close to everything."
0,"Took the kids here lastnight for dinner.  I woke up, that is a good sign.  I am bummed to see that in  years we were away, this place really took a dive.  The prices went up, thequality of the food went down and got smaller, the service was awful,  our order was all jacked up.  I could go on and on. Just because my son and I ask for no sauce doesnt mean we dont want the sour cream.  The shit was dry and we had to power down our food with soda shots like we were on Fear Factor.  No refills... Chips sucked. Ok, thats right I was trying to stop the compliment train. nnWe used to love coming here, now we will add it to the dont eat at list with Carrapas.  Even our server looked like he would have rather been anywhere but there.  Sad thing is, I remember him from when we used to dine here all of the time.  Poor guy used to be so chipper and happy.  Place sucked the life right out of him.nnMy one complaint is about paying.  I used to be a server, I know how this works.  All I had on me was a .  Dinner came to roughly ..  All large bills when he gave me change.  Yes, I know they arent a bank.  And I did not take off stars because of this gripe.  But just because I pay like a high roller doesnt mean I am one, and I am not going to over tip because all of the sudden once you saw my loot you thought you could save the last  minutes of torture we endured.

0,I had not been here for a while and I just stopped in for a quick lunch. The Mediterranean salad looked good. I ordered it with chicken. Ordering and the wait were quick. I was disappointed in the salad. Half of it was macaroni pasta and it didnt look like the photo on the menu board. I was excited about all those yummy vegetables. Take away the macaroni and it was like a small or regular side salad.
0,"I would have given zero stars if I could. Took my family to this Acro station to fuel up. The attendant took my cash entered the wrong pump number so I found out later. I got my receipt went to pump only to be told I told the cashier the wrong pump. Well I think I know the difference from pump  and pump . I went to the manager and he sided with his employee and no gas was pumped or no refund was provided. We called the Henderson police and they still wouldnt give a refund or pump gas. The cop said it was a civil matter. They stole my cash even when I had the receipt in my hand. Beware handing over cash to these crooks.  I told the cops if I stole  from the register Id got to jail, so whats the difference? Getting ready to file a complaint through BBB."

The salmon was small and not the best tasting but the veggies that came with my plate was excellent! I even substitute my mashed potatos for them but the waitress forgot then realized it and brought me a side of veggies. The bf got the spaghetti and he didnt like it and had better.

0,"This place is ok if you have low standards for food quality.  Drinks were just so so and but cost full price.  The fish tacos came on flour tortillas instead of corn and tasted like thousand island dressing.  The rice and bean looked like they just opened a box of ricearoni.  Seriously low quality ingredients dressed up to be fine food.  This place lacked enthusiasm like corporate chains often do, but not always.  I was disappointed.  The decor was nice though.nGo somewhere else if you want a good meal."
0,"Used to be a regular here until problems starred occuring. First of all,  for a one hr massage is a steal..hot stones included. Went for my first time and I found out my lady with Lisa, she was a pretty nice lady and did a great job. The space is very small and the chairs are lined out in the open, so there arent any dividers. after my first massage I realized that there was a dog grooming place next door and decided that next time I go at night. Come next time and there arent any dogs barking but the employees are louder. The employees dont have a formal break room so theres a little hallway with have a microwave where they eat, you can hear literally everything...even the microwave beeping...mutiple times. The employees talk to each other more at night too...including to the lady who massaged me. Not considerate at all! Great price, but the atmosphere is not relaxing at all. Will not be coming back."
0,"OK, heres the lowdown. The breakfast is unnecessary. Id rather had just eaten somewhere else, and done the  hour trail ride by itself. The breakfast is instant pancakes. The cooking staff was less than friendly. She didnt even try to look at me in the eye, or bother to shake my hand. The wrangler was nice, but the less than polite behavior continued when we were greeted by a girl at a table that required a  per person gratuity in advance. I told her that no one had informed us of this in advance, and she gave me a sarcastic glare. I had no problem with tipping at the end of the ride, but as the total cost for the  of us was already , I feel  would have been more than adequate. I doublechecked their website, and it says nothing about a gratuity. As far as the ride went, we have been on many trail rides, and frankly this one was boring. It was all flat, no desert travel, and mostly consisted of gravel roads or paved roads, with an occasional ranch house, and a sprig of pine trees. Its more like riding around a neighborhood. nnIn contrast, for  the  of us rode at Mount Charleston Trail Rides for  hours to an elevation of  feet, and it was very scenic along old indian trails. Even though I only paid  at Mt Charleston, I tipped them  anyway, and they were happily grateful, and had never asked for a gratuity. That ride was MUCH MUCH better."
0,"I cant even begin to write about how disgusting this buffet was! Its really too bad because I do like the Luxor, but this buffet fails on every level.nnI was there for the breakfast buffet and though the counter of offerings looks plentiful, most were just repeats. There are no fresh prepared stations, no omelets, no eggs, nothing, everything precooked and none of it looked appetizing. nnI looked for bagels and cream cheese, maybe a coffee? Well the one bagel I found nearly cracked my tooth and the coffee was sewer water. In fact I could argue hat the coffee at dunkin donuts is better. nnWe walked out without eating anything at all."
0,"I tried the banana nutella cupcake. The cake part was banana bread, which was great. However, the frosting on top was way too sweet, tasted strongly of cream cheese, and no nutella flavor was to be found.  I really wanted macaroons, but was told they are only available ThSa. The prices are quite high at nearly  per cupcake. I likely wont visit again."

My wife ordered the house salad and commented that the dressing was a little watery. My caeser was over dressed and came garnished with tomatoes. I felt we both got the cheap end of the lettuce as well. nnEntruees were also disappointing as the ratio of sauce to pasta was either too much or too little and both poorly seasoned. The Italian sausage tasted like a breakfast sausage as well. Good news is that my diet coke was good and my wife enjoyed her Italian soda.
0,"Cafe Mitz gathers a strong Asian crowd and a strong college crowd. Theyre located across Maryland from UNLV, next to the laundromat. nnI think its Japaneseowned and operated. Theres always a genial middleaged man working the counter when I go in. I dont know about back of the house. nnThe menu is Japanese fast food kind of. They do bento boxes, sushi, and bowls don. The prices are decent, for the amount of food you get. Like the Salmon Teriyaki bento  I got last week had a small salmon chunk, a generous serving of rice, three small California roll pieces, edamame, seaweed salad, and a small garden salad. I also got a piping hot green tea for , which is refillable if you dine in. And I got a teriyaki kushi dango skewered mochi for . It was obviously outsourced and there were three skewers in the package. nnThe location is pretty convenient. nnThe ambiance is okay. Its like youre in a fast food restaurant. In Japan. Everything is clean and organized. nnI dont know, theres not much to say here. You get what you pay for. The fare isnt such that you need to go out of your way to check this place out. But its good between classes. There, I said it."
0,"I saw this dentist to have my wisdom teeth out. When I was there first for the consultation I asked the office lady to make sure my insurance was gonna cover it. All was good and I paid only a copay. When I went for the extraction, again I asked her to make sure all was well, and she said yep ur fine. Then I got a bill for . When I called they said Oh, you reached your maximum, which I had never done in my life but that year I got my first crown... When I explained to the staff that I specifically was told by the staff that it would be covered no one helped. So I made an appt with Dr Twesme asking for some leniency, maybe to meet me half way, he was demeaning, annoyed, and told me that you should pay your bills young lady. Thats right, Im young. And your lazy staff didnt obviously contact my insurance and no one is taking responsibility except me. I paid the  over the course of a year. Between them and I, I was the only honorable one.nPS He did ok on the extractions."
0,". Nothing comes with your  membershipn. Aweful costumer service  literally grabbed food from under guest and threw it away.n. Bad experiencennGreat concept for entertainment. However, our group member accidently grabbed food from the buffet in the back, he didnt realize it was for a private party. One of the employees came over and understandably reprimanded him. He apologized for the mistake, offer to pay for it and apologize to party. Although I tried to stop the employee, they took the fresh food from under him and threw it right in the garbage! nnThey ignored our solution and chose an ignorant one. When I reminded the manager that people die from starvation   an animal was slaughtered for the food,  he claimed there was no other way to handle the incident.nn..so the answer was to GRAB THE FOOD FROM UNDER YOUR GUEST AND THROW IT IN THE TRASH??! Riiiiggghhtt...never going there again."
0,"I know it would be wrongheaded to expect a great burrito from a bar and maybe I should not have ordered it.  The burrito was not good.  It was more of a vegetable wrap.  My date didnt take the burrito detour and ordered a wrap directly.  It was a lonely little thing in a plastic basket.  She described it as good, not great.  But these facts alone do not earn this restaurants two stars.  Mortimers gets this rating because they served dinner, on a Friday night, with plastic silverware.  No points awarded for how amazingly close an approximation to real, shiny silverware these plastic forks and knives provided.  nnThe food quality, the cramped quarters, and yes, the plastic silverware all gave me the impression that I was dining on an airplane."
0,Stopped by here with LiLy D to grab a quick bite. nnWe were in a rush so I just got pho tai. The waiter doesnt come by to check to see if Im ready to order. He doesnt come by to check to see how everything is. They charge . for tea...wtf?nnThanks for picking up the check LiLy!
0,"Disappointing. I had found this place ahead of time, and liked the menu so I brought a few friends from a conference we were attending. Im from the East Coast so I was looking forward to some good Mexican food in Arizona. Ha. Ive had better enchiladas in Delaware. nnI ordered the Green Chile Barbacoa Enchiladas, which the waitress gushed about, but also because I had decided to get them ahead of time since they sounded great. Meh. No kick to them at all, but also there was really nothing inside them. They seemed small and empty. They looked real pretty on the plate, Ill give them that, but they were mild in taste. Sort of a tourist version of an enchilada. My friends were equally unenthused about their dishes, though they said they were good. nnOn the plus side, the corn bread they served us was tasty."
0,Local breeze is purgatory for a bar. Doesnt have any direction and has no idea what it wants to be. Food and service are inconsistent along with hours of operation. Has so much potential considering the beautiful patio space. Maybe live music on weekends or some tvs for watching football...? Ok pick something. Food is circling the drain. This local is done with it. Yuk. There are other patio games in town.
0,"The only reason anyone should ever visit the Imperial Palace is because their baby was kidnapped and being held for ransom in one of the rooms.  And even then I would say to think twice.nnThis place suuuuuuuuuuuuucks.  I despise the parking garage that only a psychic with telekinetic powers and a smart car can get through.  I despise the dark, damp, smoky air that looms EVERYWHERE.  I despise the filthy carpets.  I despise the theater.nnWhy does it seem like everyone staying here is checking in for a month?!  Whats with all the luggage?!nnAnd dont get me started on the Dealertainers.  Im pretty sure Michael Jackson was being performed by a white high school basketball player.  For the girls team.nnIt appears as though they are going through some kind of renovation.  I cant imagine what those poor people are pulling up out of the walls and carpet.  nnUnless you like to feel like youre in a giant hostel while smoking three packs of cigarettes in five minutes via second hand smoke, stay away.  Seriously.  Stay.  Away."
0,"I must have been there on a bad night Sunday because there were not actually any people there. Even the free bottle of vodka did not help the situation. It did have a good view of the strip, but that only entertained me for about  minutes. Drank our vodka and then moved on to Lavo...THAT is where the people were."
0,"Dont waste your time! Worst  Panda Ive ever been to. Got there at  pm, the peak dinner time, and I counted  entrees empty! When she asked me what I wanted, I asked her when everything else was coming up and in a very snooty attitude she said in three minutes. So I said I wanted two different entrees, and she asked if I wanted to pay for it now? Ummm no idiot, Ill pay for it when its ready!"
0,"Ugh!nnFirst, a lack of creativityoriginality on the name of the place.  Puhleeze!nnThen, I wasnt sure what to order because none of my colleagues had been here before.  So, I thought Id go safe and order chicken alfredo topped with feta cheese and accompanied with slices of garlic bread.nnStupid me, I should have stopped the minute I had my first bite.  It tasted odd.  I thought it mustve been because of the feta cheese.  I just had my first taste of flamed feta cheese minutes before that a friend ordered as an appetizer.nnImmediately after I had my fill of dinner, my stomach cramped.  blank! blank! blank!nnAs a result, I was up that following morning at am, throwing up...for  hours!  Yep, food poisoning!  To be sick in a strange city is not comforting!nnUgh!  I should have trusted my instinct and dined elsewhere.nnLike I said...ugh!"
0,Stopped in before a Knights game and you could tell the staff was clueless. They had several open tables and a line out the door.  They were advising waiting customers they couldnt seat them for at least  minutes because they didnt want to overwhelm the kitchen.  Im sure it will get better when they get some experienced staff but would recommend avoiding for a while until they work the kinks out.
0,"Worst place ever!!!nnI like their arcade but thats about it.nnIt was my first time staying here and the only reason I decided to stay here was because they were offering a nice discounts on the rooms. nnSo after hanging out at the pool, my friends and I decide to go inside to play at some tables and the arcade. We were having fun and all, then I was walking around and security comes up to me and says that he has to escortkick me out for wearing a bikini in the casino...umm really??? where the fuck is there a sign posted saying no bikinis???nnWith that said...I will NOT stay at this hotel ever again."
0,"Ive only been here on Friday nights and only because a lot of my friends insist on meeting up here. Im guessing it is because there in no cover to get in, but there is a lineand it goes quickly. I really cant stand anything about this place. Everything from the music to the people have a overall lack of class and tact."
0,"Absutely the worst experience! I will never, ever bring another family membern to tbis hospital. The nursing staff for the most part was great, however, the doctors on staff are horrible!  The were all pleasant if the immediate family was present, but very rude to my Mom when she was alone. Just an example of the level of care or lack of care her entire chart was deleted from the system.  A week later they are still trying to input her records. Im only giving  star and thats because of the great nurses. They better cleanup their act or they are going to loose the only good thing they have going for them, their nurses."
0,Some businesses dont care about their customers.  The girls who work there are nice and down to earth so its not that.  Its the old dirty towels and freezing floors in the machines without any mats or at least an extra floor towel in the dressing space.  This place is super basic nothing but average across the board.
0,"Sorry Sammys we did not have a good st and last visit. Food not worth price at all. Should have left but some of the reviews sounded so good, we thought dont judge a book by the cover. Looked busy cause  cars in line had to wait as did we cause only worker was outside by us with his kids  handling a personal problem ok. So we stood there wondering who worked here , then he got off ph and went in to take order. I dont think they have anything not frozen cause he had to run in and out to a back room for bags of frozen item a few times . min and like  bucks in food later we finally had dinner and damn not good. Pastrami was ok but We found a bomb pastramifrenchfry spot down the road week later POPs yum."
0,I place a phone order twice a week from this location and today am told they have never accepted phone order and denied my business. They usually mess up your order anyway. If they dont want my money then I dont think I will be giving them any more of it..
0,"Lemme start by saying if you are capable of slapping a burger on a grill and cooking it then youve got virtually no reason to go here. Unless you have neither a grill or ground beef. nnAt that point though youd be better off going with almost any other place that has burgers. My Double Char Cheese double cheese burger was akin to what I used to get at my high school football games. Lettuce, tomato, pickle, mayo, and caramelized onions only really added color to the over powering taste of dry charred meat. The fries were generic lightly salted deals with nothing special. They do offer sweet potato fries that I did not try.  It wasnt horrible or inedible but I wouldnt go back. InNOut across the street does this classic American meal much better."
0,"To be honest, I find Bagel etc a bit overrated. I remember going there in the past and being satisfied, but when I went last week I was very disappointed. It was pretty busy for a week day so my boyfriend and I were seated in the back, where it was extremely hot. I ordered the eggs benedict, which I do almost everytime I go out for breakfast, and it was bad. Dont get me wrong, I love Fairmount Bagels, but I didnt like the fact that they used bagel instead of english muffins. I know that bagels are their speciality, but some classics really dont need to be reinvented... I also have to mention that the eggs were overdone. My boyfriend got a  eggs   choices of meat special for , which was apparently good. Not that its so hard to make, though. Seriously, the best thing about this place is that you dont have to ask for hot sauce, because there are Sriracha bottles on every table."
0,"Took a cab from Tempe Diablo Stadium to Courtyard Marriott  Sky Harbor. Just a few miles but the driver keyed the wrong hotel and was well passed the hotel when I let him know he was going the wrong way. I had to look up the address and give it to him. When he finally got us there he didnt offer to adjust the fare even though it was his fault. First time, last time with these guys."
0,"My husband had almost everything he needed for our wedding. He had the tie, the shirt, the pants, the belt, and the shoes. We simply needed a vest and told the guy helping us that right up front. He was friendly, which is the only reason this place gets two stars and not one, but he is also the reason this place is getting two stars in the first place. He was pushy and made us feel like my husbands already chosen pieces of attire were not good enough. Those pants are too long, that shirt wont match anything, I think a different tie will look better, etc etc. We were very firm in telling him that we have made up our mind and all we needed was a vest, but he proceeded to sell us the following anyway A shirt, pants, shoes, belt, jacket, tie, socks, and various other items we had no interest in purchasing. We felt so pressured and like he wasnt listening to our needs. We will never come back here, lest we want to spend the day being pressured to buy the entire store."
0,"So everyone who comes to this place is either high, hungry, or insecure.  When I went to Cheba Hut the wanna be hipster behind the counter told me that mayonnaise was almost pure fat. Well thanks for the lesson buddy Im sure it took a lot for your handful of brain cells to remember that but dont pass it on to me. Maybe if I was fat, I would be like Oh hey this kid is watching out for me but Im not fat. In fact I need fat. Have you seen my profile picture for god sakes?nn They charge too much. They. Charge. Too. Much. Next time you go there, look at the ingredients of your food, then look at the value. Now back to me. Youll never value this good in your Cheba Hut burger. But thats ok. The truth is I could live without the group of pot smoking staff they have behind the register. I mean I get it you smoke pot, Ive done it before too. But I dont define my life by it. Cheba Hut is the epitome of my hate. Also, beware of the pretentious guys that talk like half their mouth got a shot of Novocaine."
0,"My friend  I tried this place today for a very late breakfast. I have never been there so I was just a bit confused by the menu. Maybe bc I was just very excited that they offer vegan food as well as organic, I love having great options. When I asked her to explain the menu to me, she did, when I asked another question about the menu which she already went over, she talked to me really slow as if I was retarded. I get it, you already explained it, I asked a question that was answered, but no need to treat me like I have a mental disorder. nnI will say, my order was good, it wasnt great  it definitely wasnt amazing. The presentation of the food was sloppy, which doesnt matter since it doesnt effect the taste, but its thrown in a small box  it was , I definitely was expecting more.nnI would say that I would possibly go back sometime BUT the girls customer service was disgusting  that made my decision not want to go back. My friend stated that there was nothing that impressed her and that she will stick to True Foods.nn star for offering vegan food.n star for offering organic food."
0,"Im shocked at the other reviews that give higher marks... this place is a must skip! I agree, the atmosphere is nice being outside on the water and Im a big fan of Pier  next door... however, it takes a lot more than just the outside atmosphere to make me want to go back to a place. The layout of the place is just awkward we walked through the front door into a big open space that looks like a banquet hall and then one random table inside near the fireplace. Outside there is one section of picnic tables that dont fit in with the style and then around the other side of the building are seating areas and tables and chairs. We sat at a table to order dinner however the tables were very awkward to sit at the bars of the legs and supports got in the way of where your feet go, plus the chairs were really rigid and uncomfortable. Service is meh... some servers looked like they wanted to be there and work, ours did not.... we ordered drinks and queso fundido which took  minutes to come out and was only so so the chorizo was a nice touch but the cheese hardened soon after it arrived to our table and we needed to scrap it with a fork to get some for the chips. For dinner, I ordered the green chilies enchiladas and my boyfriend ordered the burger. Our food took an hour to come out expected if the place was totally busy and slammed with people... not the case here. While waiting we had the great entertainment of the drunks sitting in one of the couch areas next to our table. The ladies were over served and stumbling and screaming while looking for one of their phones making the atmosphere hard to enjoy. Luckily they left half way through our our wait for the food but made the couch area a disaster while looking for the phone funniest part of that is not one staff member fixed the area! The cushions were everywhere and pillows on the ground no one cared to take the minute to clean it up for others to sit at. When our food finally arrived, the music had been turned up and we could barely hold a conversation. The burger my boyfriend got had a bun that was bigger than necessary and he needed to cut away over half of it to fit it in his mouth an additional bonus for him to find out was that the burger was burned. My enchiladas were so incredibly spicy that I couldnt eat them. I used the excess parts of the burgers bun to try and take the burn out of my mouth. I ate about two bites and was done. The server never checked on us to see how things were until our drinks were empty and we had been sitting there for  minutes without touching our food... when I told her that the enchiladas were extremely spicy, she took my side plate and placed it over the dinner plate, picked it up and said ok and walked away to get the bill. Didnt ask if I wanted something else, take it home, or take it off the bill I clearly had hardly touched the food... Over priced food and drinks for crappy food and service. Save your money and mouth by skipping this place go next door to Pier !!"
0,"Went there today for some supplies and they didnt even have pencil cases anywhere! Not even in the home and office section. nnAlways crowded, loud and most of the time it smells like shit. nnAlso if you open the milk case it smells like they killed the cow the milk came from and let it sit in the bottom of the freezer in its own shit. nnI wont ever go here unless I cant find an item anywhere else."
0,"It was all right. My boyfriend had a craving for fish and chips, but we were too lazy to drive anywhere. This place delivered, and it delivered fast about half an hour. The fries were too salty, and the dinner came with three small pieces of fish. I would like to try a pizza off their menu sometime, since those sound good."
0,"Im not a big beauty product person, but I do like to pamper myself once in a while with a manipedi.  Decided to give this place a try since they offered gel polish and had certified technicians on staff, so I made a reservation.  Walking in wasnt too bad, but when they didnt have my reservation on file, when two different staff members tried to check me in, and when the technician didnt realize I had asked for two manis my husband was with me and wanted a clean up, I tried not to worry.  As we sat down, our assigned manicurist, Lori, was extremely chipper and talkative and offered to do both of us at the same time.  After asking for my color in gel, she very casually questioned whether or not that was what I really wanted, said that it might be pretty, but that they had a whole other shelf of polish in the pedicure room.  I wasnt sure what to say, since Ive never been questioned on my choice of nail color...so I went to check out the other colors.  While they have a ton of OPI and China Glaze polishes in lots of colors, I was there for gel, and when they didnt have the color I was hoping for in in gel, I had to go with regular polish.  nnI have nothing against regular polish, but my job is very hands on, and I dont enjoy paying  to get my fingernails painted just to have them chipping in two days.  I ended up having to choose regular polish anyway, and by this time she was almost done with my husbands hands.  Long, painful story short...I found Lori really enjoys talking, cooking, spending time in the kitchen, talking, her children, her grandchildren, making her own food, her freedom in not needing a job  but wanting one, talking, her dutch heritage, and talking.  There was very little focus on the actual manicure, the massage was lackluster with no pressure and a lot of lotion, she never touched our cuticles, didnt clip our nails, gave my husband a file and buffing block to touch up what he wanted, and when she finally painted my fingers, it looked like a threeyear old trying desperately to color inside the lines.  She never even acknowledged the paint all over my skin.  nnRegardless, we paid our  and left having learned a lesson that we will not be returning to Beauty Brands for personal care.  I didnt bother to look at any of the products in the store though it seemed wellstocked and organized, but the sketchy service from what their website touts as professional certified technicians isnt something Id like to deal with again.  There are plenty of smaller, local options that are much more attentive and do a better job for the same price."
0,"Ive been checking out gyms after my  Hour Fitness membership expired. I was reluctant to renew it.nnWith my threeday trial pass on hand, I went to  LA Fitness. It is in a convenient area, smack in Camelback, with a very promising space. nnConvenient is centrally located with ample parking, however, thats not what makes a good gym. Promising is when, at first glance, the workout space extends all the way back like a long bowling alley with lots of machines. Upon closer look, some machines were dirty, others vandalized, most had seen better days.nnAfter a warm up on an elliptical which handle bars were stickier than honey dried in an afternoon sun, I went for chest machines. I did three sets of seated fly only to notice that per visual diagram I did    ATE  FLY. I felt compelled to wash my hands. nnPromising is a locker room, clean and bright, where you can wash off the built up of sweat and grime on your hand. Reality is a wash room that is more like a petri dish for new drug resistant strain of flesheating bacteria just waiting to make the giant leap from dirty floor to human skin. nnIf youre a bacteria, this gym is convenient and promising. Threeday trial pass not required. If youre human, get a pass before joining. Maybe I was there on a bad day.nnAs for the lady working at the front desk? She was staring blankly outside waiting for redemption when her shift is over. I didnt bother to discuss membership options."
0,"Wow. I dont know how this place has  stars. By far the worst experience Ive had anywhere in my whole life.  of us walked in, several tables werent bussed. We set up our own table and waited and waited and I finally just got up and picked up our own menus. After that, the server came by and took the menus because we wanted ayce and ayce was a different menu. After that she gave us  menus and we had to beg her for our waters. Lol. Gosh we should have left  then. So m pass and we only got  orders or shrimp tempra and  orders of albacore. So pissed!  parties walk in and got their rolls and I Asked her, why are they getting their food first?! We were here way before them And she said because they were al la carte. Wtf!!??? I told the kids to get in the car and told her were only paying for what we got. So I walk to the register and saw what she was charging us and she was writing the rolls we didnt get and I told her we never got those rolls and she can check the plates that  were still left on the table. Bill came out to  and I still left  tip. I def dont recommend coming here. Sooooooo stupid!!!"

0,"I have to say, this hotel has been nothing but disappointing, and we still have three nights to go. We came to Vegas for a wedding and stayed here as the bride had booked a block of rooms. The only plus thus far is that its pretty central within the strip. nnThus far Parking is a nightmare. There is construction going on where the usual entrance would be and the only signage is a tiny sign hidden behind trees letting you know to make a Uturn and go around back. Then, the elevators from the parking garage to the lobby are disgusting. They look like death. Not to mention, parts are missing  as in, you look up, you can see the cables. Super reassuring.nnCheck in We arrived at pm on a Wednesday. We were waiting  minutes to check in! I would have to imagine theyre used to crowds, they should really have more than  people checking people in. Yowza. nnRoom The room if you get an updated one is fine. Its big we had two queens, standard room. Problems The bathroom vent fan filter was absolutely filthy. Dust everywhere. The toilet and the shower ran  constant noise. Both the lights in the room didnt work. Walls are very thin, you can hear everyone and everything in the halls and next door. Also, ask if you are going to face the pool area  music blasts until about midnight Which I dont mind so much, but youll want to know. The beds, I will say, are super comfortable. No complaints there.nnWe ordered room service  a movie package which included large popcorn, Red Vines, two sodas and two bottles of water  .. When I called to order the lady put me on hold three times and finally said Ill call you back because apparently this was a new menu item and she couldnt find it. When she did call back, I had to remind her about the sodas. What arrived  minutes later Two bags of microwave popcorn half popped,  Red Vines, two glasses of water, and two minibottles of soda. Excellent. nnOverall, Im not impressed at all. I love the history of this place, and its location, but its so not compensating for the rest of the mess."
0,"Its unfortunate that I write this review.  My husband and I have lived here for just under a year. And in that time there have been three management companies and nothing done about maintenance.  We like to treat our place like we own it and we are sorely disappointed in that so many items have been overlooked and not repaired over a years time.  And now they want to raise our rent.  We already pay top of the line rent for a place that has become more and more in disrepair.  Instead of having mature adults that care about their surroundings they are more interested in young, trashy youth that dont care about whether they vandalize or trash the community The fire pit has been out of commission all winter and now we are heading into summer and they refuse to fix it.  The fitness facility is sorely in need of updating.  The dumb bell collection is incomplete and in disrepair.  They have one remote control for  televisions.  No body wipes down the equipment after use and it is disgusting.  There is litter all over the complex at all times.  The maintenance staff tries to keep up with it, but the complex is full of pigs.  There is continuous speeding and reckless driving throughout the complex at all hours.  Couches and furniture are dumped in the dumpsters almost nightly people move out in the middle of the night leaving trash behind  I am really really disappointed in the new management company and how little they care. We are nickeled and dimed on every aspect of our rent.  So if you think the base rent is what you will end up paying....think again.  Water, more money.  Trash, more money.  Have a pet?  Well even more money.  Sorry Alta RavenwoodRavenwood Heights, you fail. Please note,  my husband and I ARE NOT renewing our lease!!!! And make note....the complex will change names to Ravenwood Heights, so do not be fooled.  PB Bell is no better than Alliance."
0,"I was appalled to learn of these acts of cruelty being performed on  helpless , trusting cats . According to documents obtained by PETA, a cat named Double Trouble had her eyes, ears, and brain operated on. Steel coils were implanted into her eyes and a stainless steel post was screwed into her skull so that her head could be immobilized during experiments. Then, she had holes drilled into her skull so that electrodes could be inserted in her brain. Experimenters then applied atoxic substance to her inner ears to deafen her and electrical implants were placed deep inside both of her ears.nUWs rationale for this torture is to improve the design of hearing aids . In fact , they have been doing this for  years and proud of it.....again....they are proud of animal cruelty.nAnimal testing may help with the groundwork for curing diseases, but it doesnt take away from the fact that animals are still suffering. It is cruel and immoral. There are other ways scientists can gather information to build upon. nI am hearing impaired and wear a hearing aide. Every day I will be reminded of these experiments.nPlease sign CARE  petition asking University of Wisconsin to stop all experiments on cats.nnHorrible practices in this day and age."
0,"Horrible business, went to location on Rancho to get a oil change. Notice upon check out they did not use the correct Manufactor Recommendation w. I asked the guy at the desk to correct the problem. He got the manager, manager said, I will have to charge you for another oil change if that is what you want my comment back was, you need to follow the directions they place on the chaises of the vehicle, and not just use any old oil you have laying around your shop. At this point the manager was yelling at me in front of his customers and I was yelling back because the manager Jesse is not a real manager. I was told to contact the Pecos location by the front desk guy and I did, the manager at this location was just as bad as the location I went toyelling over the phone at me. Needless to say if you are looking for a quality mechanic, try another mechanic and skip Royalty because if they could read they would be using the right parts for the right job."
0,"Delicious sandwich. Disappointing service. Very Disappointing experience.  The ticket was about  more than I mentally added up because of up added charges. Extra  for the  grain bread, extra  for cheese, extra because they charged both sandwiches for Avocado when it was only on one sandwich. There are too many other great restaurant choices for sandwiches. I dont like feeling tricked. Buy local ... Better ideas."
0,"During a time which seems so long ago, this was the it place for movies.  After going tonight, it now seems old and dirty  a sharp contrast to memory.  Tickets are higher in price than Harkins, and large size popcorn and drinks at Harkins get one free refill.  From what I understand, nothing is free at AMC unless you first spend  to purchase some kind of card.  Emphasis on the word spend..  Both the movie and sound quality were good.  The strange thing is the theatre became noticeably warm hot midway through the movie.  The problem was corrected."
0,"Not bad, but not sure that its worth the price tag. For starters, we were totally ripped off on Valentines Day, when we were told that we would be getting the Valentines Day Package. I asked if there were other alternatives, since I had the feeling Chima was trapping us into getting charged extra for this, knowing that every other restaurant in the vicinity was probably booked for Valentines evening. We were told there was none, so with no other choice we just went with it. We ended up paying an extra  for an okay glass of champagne, standard cup of coffee, and a total joke of a brownie ice cream dessert, all the ingredients of which tasted as if they had come out of a box andor storebought mix. Total for the night was close to  per person, after the  fee for the mandatory package, which they totally skimped on, knowing that a lot of people would be coerced into getting it. Not cool.nnEverything else was pretty good. The meat was good, nothing amazing. I wasnt very impressed by the meats I looked forward to trying, such as the filet mignon, but my boyfriend enjoyed his meal a lot. The buffet bar was wonderful though, with lots of gourmet options. The parmesan breads were hands down AMAZING and totally ADDICTIVE.nnOverall, a very mixed experience because Chima clearly knew it was misleading a bunch of people into paying an extra  on Valentines Day. They were not upfront about it at all, and the price was never posted on their website, FB page, etc before we came. Basically, we got there and were told we would be getting it, no other options available. If they ever mention a package for a particular night, definitely call ahead of time and inquire about the price. And chances are, its not worth it."
0,"I obviously had not had as much to drink or smoke as the previous reviewers when I decided to try The Parlor  weeks ago. It has the potentialbones to be a quaint mod place....get rid of the servers, food and shit alcohol selection and it would be better than it is now. I can take the worst parking in the world for an outstanding place. This aint it. Where to start, where to start??? n. The hostess moved like a barnacle as well as the wait staff. They were either all stoned on nonmedical grade weed or were told to look and act aloof, disgusted and put off by the customers. It was bordering on comical. n. I hate when new places open in the neighborhood expect you to pay high prices for food items and then have shit alcohol choices. We arent by ASU. If we can afford your restaurant, we can afford higher end alcohol. Remember you are serving the publics taste, not your own. Do the research on high end, hell I would even take midiocre, alcohol choices and present them. You have such a varied menu, but then no choice of vodka..and no organic. Wine list sucks too! n. It took  minutes to get a server and there were  tables open. I counted. Then she said Ill be right back.. minutes later..then she only took our drink order, after she had to go see what kind of vodka they carried. n. The worst ceasar salad I have ever had. EVER! It tasted like the tangy heel of a cheap shoe. n. The cheese meat platter was a joke. They cut the meat in big slices for you, but not the hard cheeses and they dont label or tell you which is which... or give you a hard cheese slicer. NICE!n. Our server came back after  minutes of getting our food, just in enough time for us to ask fo the check and get the F...out of there. nnWe then proceeded to Hulas Modern Tiki for the rest of our dinner, since we were still starving due to the fact that I was worried, that as slow as the wait staff was, that our dinner would spoil on the walk from the kitchen to our table and we would then have a hospital visit. nIm not real keen on hospital food, but it would be a grade up from here. nnIn conclusion, if you dont understand good design, like less then sub parr food, but believe you need to be seen in the new it place...just cuz...then go for it. nnNow Hulas Modern Tiki on the other hand....reviewing soon."
0,"Worst Thai food ever. I eat Thai food about once every month and i have been to Thailand twice. Vegetable Egg roll had thick raw dough and inside the vegetable had weird taste, fried rice seemed seasoned with only soy sauce and salt and pad Thai was also didnt have any authentic flavor. Service was also slow on Sunday. I will never recommend this place to anybody!!!"
0,Tha atomosphere at the Rainforest is delightful especially for a  year olds birthday. But it is pricey.... . for ice tea or soda.... Sandwhiches average ...but what I thought was really cheesey was the . charge for a birthday cupcake  Really???nCome on.... Definite rip off!!!!!nBut for a special occasion it was worth it
0,Pizza  whats up with the dough? Not a fan of the crust at ALL.nWe ordered two pizzas and got an order of wings.nnWe still have one and a half pizzas leftover.nThe wings were pretty decent though!
0,"A friend was in town recently and wanted a great meal.  Although I had not been there, I suggested Christophers.  When we arrived we decided to eat at the kitchen bar, but after we ordered out drinks we saw a couple seated outside and decided it was a perfect night for it.  We asked the hostess if we could move and she begrudging agreed.  When we walked outside, she wanted to seat us at the table right next to the door I think as punishment for this huge imposition even though there were plenty of other tables available.  We asked to sit at the table farthest from the door to give us some space between the other diner and be in a better position to watch the world go by.  The hostess found this very upsetting and tried to force us to sit next to the door, but after our protestations finally said it would be OK with her if we sat at the other table, but that the server was not going to like it.  She sat us in purgatory as steam escaped from her ears and brought our drinks, but that was the last we saw of any servers.  I did notice the hostess and some servers were having quite a discussion about us and I heard one person say OK, fine, we will let them finish their drinks.  I wasnt exactly sure what that meant, but after  minutes of being left in the cold and while we were finishing our drinks, the bread guy came by and we asked him to ask someone to get our check.  A waiter finally showed up with a check and was bewildered to find out we were leaving.  However, my impression was that they had decided not to serve us dinner and were simply waiting for us to get the message.nnThat is a very large space Christopher is paying rent on and that night the restaurant was almost empty.  I would think in the current economic environment his staff would have the good sense to bend over backwards to accommodate their guests, but we were left with the impression that they felt they were doing us a favor by being open."
0,I went to Michael Kors to  shop the jewelry section for a Christmas gift. The sales clerk named Linda took a sentry stance  front of  of me and the jewelry  case and refused to speak to me. Apparently this sales clerk does not consider an ethnic person such as myself a viable customer. I live in North Scottsdale and Im sure I make more money than a sales clerk.
0,"Horrible service, drove from chandler because we heard this was the best. Picked up our to go order and NO noodles in the chow mein. We called and the said they would deliver the noodle after we told them were we lived they said its too far they are too busy to deal with it and we get a  dollar credit. The dish was around  dollars and the reason to get chow mein is the noodles. After spending time on the phone the lady said the noodles arent even that good and customer dont like why are they on your menu then?  The way they deal with customers is horrible save your coin."
0,"Came here for drinks, food, and to watch a game. Great selection of beers, however service was unacceptable. We waited much longer than the wait time the hostess suggested. The food was terrible. It came out cold and not as described on the menu. When it came to leave our server had to go back  times because she couldnt get the check right. Will not be back or recommend this to anyone unless you just want to drink beer at the bar."
0,"This review is strictly on the Botox injections I received at Voci Spa. I know nothing else about their services like massages and facials so those may be great. My Botox experience has not been pleasant at all. I got in at the last minute with their most seasoned Botox injector. She spent plenty of time w me discussing her credentials and how she does things. I was very clear in my expectations about wanting my crowsfeet taken care of. She suggested we do something like  units on each side including below the eyelid, right on top of my cheek where I have some fine lines as well. I told her I was hesitant bc I had heard it shouldnt be placed there due to lower eyelid swelling which can cause bags and even weaken your cheek a bit which could cause a slight sagging. Ive been told this by other injectors. She assured me that would not be the case and encouraged me to do it. She said they charge by the unit which is what I was told when I initially called. This is not exactly precise. They charge by the Botox syringe or vial. Basically she said I would need  on each side so I had to purchase two syringesvials meaning Id have left over product.nShe said shed find somewhere else to place the extra so I wouldnt waste it but I declined. I told her I wanted to go conservative this first time and maybe later I could come back for more vs using it just to use it. It was a turn off bc I was actually paying per area and not really per unit as I had been told. Anyway, she injected around my eyes including underneath. I bruised badly underneath my right eye which has never happened before and both lower lids immediately swelled which produced bags  extra lines. My concerns had been valid and I shouldve listened to my gut. I respect her many years in the business but that does not mean she is a good injector. A good injector takes into account the potential compensatory muscle movement and or swelling too in this case that can just give you a new problem whilst getting rid of another. The bruise goes away quickly but the bags dont and trust me Botox can cause bags underneath the eyes for sure especially when too much product is used. Dont let anybody tell you differently. The bags may improve as the Botox wheres off but while the fluid is there its just stretching out that delicate skin and I can do nothing about it. The risk of placing it under the eye is just not warranted. Now I just wait for months to see if the bags improve. So frustrating. Listen to your gut people!"
1,"I cant believe this place averages  stars. Whats wrong with people?nnThis is my favorite BBQ spot for many reasons. I know, you might be asking yourself, why then no  stars? Well, theres always a waiting list that takes too long but they have empty tables. It seems that they havent being able to figure out how many waiterswaitresses they need. th of July waiting time  hour. They didnt say that the patio waiting time was  min and that in the bar is first come first serve.nnAnyways, theres nothing not to like of the food. The wings were tasty, the ribs were great, their bbq sauces are full of flavor, and the price is right.nnAll in all, my very favorite bbq joint in AZ."
1,"Didnt get a chance to stay here but I did play here!  Some of the friendliest blackjack dealers I have played with.  Makes a big difference.   blackjack is important to anyone who is series about the game.  Good food choices, friendly service people, clean casino.  Connected to New York New York via walkway.  I will play here again."
1,"Healthy and tasty!nThis is the big difference between them and greens and proteins. For who says they are expensive they make me laugh. The food averages between  and . I dont understand where they go to get a meal for less money  than that, McDonald maybe. They are always very polite. The cappuccino and smoothies are also very good."
1,"Penn Mac is a fun shopping experience. I used to do a lot of my weekly shopping here, but now that I live in the North Hills Ive got that cantcrosstheriver syndrome and I only get there every other week or so. Its miles above a Market District, though, in terms of entertainment value and pricing.nnThe cheese counter is pretty good. Its not the most amazing selection ever, but its great for Pittsburgh. For example, they dont carry a variety of aged cheddars or Stiltons, opting instead to offer one or two basic and many flavored versions with apples, with onions, etc. They do let you sample, which I recommend like another reviewer, Ive gotten overold blue cheese here once or twice. Theyve always enforced the halfpound minimum for me. The fresh mozzarella is great, and I cant resist it when tomatoes are in season. I hate to even mention it, but one time I got home and found... well, a hair in my mozzarella. It put me off for a few weeks but seems to have been a onetime incident and no, I never brought it up to them.nnThe deli has fantastic prices and does proper thin slices, nicely laid out on paper sheets so it doesnt stick together. Daniele prosciutto is amazing, and the domestic is pretty good at a great price. Iberico and Serrano jamon? Yes please.nnService at both the cheese and deli counters can take a pretty long time if you go on a weekend. However, Ive been able to walk right up on weekday afternoons, and the weekend logjam is kind of fun once in a while.nnIn the same room they have the amazing olive bar. I pretty much only buy olives in the Strip. I know the Iggle has an olive bar, but everything Ive ever bought from one tastes off in a way I cant put my finger on. Castleventrano olives a bright, clear light green are amazing buttery and briny and fruity with a firm texture. Cerignola are good, and the various stuffed olives on offer are nice if you dont feel like dealing with pits.nnI havent really bought many of their bulk goods aside from Jordan almonds, to which I am shamelessly addicted. They have a variety of pretty colors, as well as the seconds which arent as shiny but taste great anyway.nnI love the selection of anchovies, tuna and tomato products in the dry goods area. They also have a good variety of hot sauces, though I cant say Ive ever seen Pickapeppa there. Full range I think of Daves Insanity, and lots of other brands as well. Important They do sell Blennd concentrate, which you can also pick up at the Iggle. I have fond childhood memories of drinking Blennd at the KMart cafeteria growing up. I introduced my Michiganborn husband to it and he never visits Pittsburgh without getting Blennd at least once. You can also get it premixed and cold at Wholeys, FYI.nnIn the next room youll find baccala yum, pouryourown olive oils at a reasonable price not a huge selection, but the Spanish is fruity and a good everyday sort of thing at .oz. I pretty much never buy bread here, opting to hit up the double rustic baguettes at Mancinis instead. The anise love knot cookies are great.nnThe last room has produce, normally at a good price but not the best selection. They do have fresh figs in season, thank God. I have to admit Ive never tried the fresh pasta, since thats one of those things I just make at home. I should probably remedy that so I can offer an opinion on it. They sometimes have refrigerated and readytogo San Pelligrino Chinotto, a bitter soda that comes in a pretty bottle you can use as a small vase afterwards.nnCheckout is straightforward and efficient, but you will be in line for a while if you go on a weekend. Its nuts, just like everywhere else in the Strip. If you can, visit all the shops both on a weekday and on a weekend to enjoy two totally different experiences.nnThey do have a small parking area behind the store on Liberty, with which I wish you good luck on a Saturday. Otherwise its street parking, but theres a ton of that, and walking past and through the other shops in the Strip is so much fun it shouldnt matter anyway."
1,"Went here for dinner tonight.  Service was great.  They still bring out the plate of pickles, but now they also brought slices of challah bread and rolls the onion one is awesome.nnI had the Vegetarian Delight Sandwich.  Very tasty.  The vegetable cream cheese on the sandwich was excellent.  Huge portions.  The tomato soup was good as well, but not as good as the soup at Bravi.nnI tasted some of the onion strings.  Delicious.  They had a dipping sauce that was a bit spicy.  It was good too.nnMy husband got Aarons Choice  some kind of pastramicorned beef sandwich.  He liked it, but prefers Miracle Mile.  nnOverall a good dining experience, and I got some bagels to go!"
1,"We decided to come here for our first breakfast in Scottsdale. The atmosphere and decor was very cozy and inviting. For drinks we ordered a pineapple mimosa, grapefruit mimosa and mojo chai. The mimosas were refreshing and the flavor choices were a nice twist to the standard orange juice mimosa. I highly recommend the mojo chai, which is homemade chai, espresso and vanilla. Yum! Marla, our waitress, was friendly and personable. She helped me decide between the chimichurri hash and chorizo eggs Benedict. Chimichurri hash was a great decision and was very tasty. Brandon ordered bananas foster French toast with whiskey sauce. Probably one of the best weve had! Overall it was a great place to stop. Food was delish, service was great and atmosphere was inviting. We would recommend this cafe for anyone looking for a delicious breakfast or brunch."
1,"My friend took me here for lunch.  I had two fish tacos and they were amazing!  The ingredients were fresh, the place was clean, and the people were very very friendly.   I came back here for dinner the same day and took my wife and two other friends.  Everyone agreed the place is amazing."
1,"This place has been around at least as long as I lived in Arizona but never had a chance to try until the other day.  Why did I wait over  years?nnNice upscale ambiance. I like all the decor they had. We went without reservation thinking who would eat Chinese food on Christmas Eve? I was wrong. I was told to wait  mins.  Fortunately wait wasnt too long and we were seated at nice comfy booth.nnService was good. We waited for our food a bit longer than we are used to at any other Chinese restaurants but this place was busy.nnFood was very good. Orange crispy chicken was spicy and good. Fried tofu with brown sauce became really good after I added some hot oil.nnThere are many more items on the menu I wanted to try, so I will be back soon. Next time I wont wait  years."
1,"After cracking a tooth on Monday I called a few places and Dr. Woodbury was able to see me a short  days later.  When I arrived they were able to take me promptly, being on time is very important to me and most places I have been to there has been a wait.  There was some confusion on my part, I thought that I made it clear that I needed the tooth to be fixed asap and they had booked me for and exam only.  But after realizing my dismay of not being able to fix it right away they made the time.  I had taken most of the day off of work and wasnt sure when I would have been able to come back.  I was worried that it might have been a rushed job but my concerns were unwarranted.  nI have always been the nervous type when it comes to going to the dentist, hence I need some major work done now.  I couldnt believe how utterly painless the whole procedure was, even the shot of novocain, I didnt even feel it!  I had a filling a few years ago at another place and the quality of workmanship by Dr. Woodbury really made me realize what a hack that other dentist was.  My tooth feels so smooth!nI already made my next appointment and will be seeing him every month until my smile is perfect.  I also like that even though I was able to pay for everything I needed today, when it comes time for the more expensive work, they will work with me on a payment plan."
1,"I didnt know this place existed despite two Uptown locations. Then my coworker started bringing a sandwich back to the office every day and they looked so good.nI finally went and found the line pretty much out the door. How had I missed out on this?nThe menu, while well organized, actually looked overwhelming because there were so many good looking choices. I just went with the  Parkside and had no regrets. It was delicious! They also use Boars Head meats which are top choice.nNow I get to go back and decide if I want to work my way to some of the other tasty looking choices or stick with the goodness I had. Regardless, Ill be back.nThey also have a punch card and I think after  or  visits you get  off. Not to bad seeing as most places require  punches for a free sandwich  off."
1,"We have been twice. Both times the food has been excellent and tasty, with fresh ingredients. I have had seafood both times and been very pleased with the quality and preparation. cioppino is very good Reasonably friendly staff with decent service. My only complaint was that the waitress this last time really had no knowledge of the wine list and that was really a bummer."
1,"One word... Amazing Went here twice in one weekend and enjoyed it both times. nnst visit we went for dinner. Price was average and the selection of the dishes were great. Presentation for many of the items were too cool. There was even bone marrow! That fatty, buttery goodness. I could barely finish one bone. So good, but sticks with you. There was a shrimp and mussel station where you can choose your flavors from buttery to curry. And they cook it in front of you. Desserts were good as well with some sugar free options.nnnd visit was for lunch. And we really enjoyed this as well. More new dishes to try and it all so good... again. I hardest part it choosing what to get! Our server Hong was very friend and so attentive. Made our visit that much better. We got the unlimited mimosa and champagne for , and he just kept bringing them.. too cool.nnOverall, it was a very nice experience and the food lived up to the hype. The service was good for us as well. We went early both times, and we beat the crowds. Hardly any waiting in line. Score!... Well be back!"
1,"My husband and I come to this Target so often that some of our friends tease us about it. Were usually here at least once a week, sometimes twice.nnIts not as packed with Targety goodness as a Super Target, of course, but its more well stocked than many of the older stores around town. They often cycle through seasonal items on a slightly earlier and faster schedule than other locations. Ever since they added fresh groceries and pretty reasonably priced ones, at that, we often dont need to make any other stops for the weekly shopping.nnThe Starbucks inside this Target is good. I can hardly wait for Pumpkin Spice Latte time every year. This was the Starbucks where I was introduced to the genius concept of fixing up the already delicious PSL with a vanilla shot.nnThis is also where I go for all my pharmacy needs. Its clear that a lot of other people do the same, based on the big lines that form right after work on a weekday, so I try to wait it out until the rush has died down. Thats easy enough to do, since Im in a Target. The pharmacy employees are all helpful and friendly enough in my experience  the same goes for the staff in the rest of the store.nnParking is always stressful in a parking garage for me because people tend to zoom around in them haphazardly, but this deck has enough levels that its possible to find a spot without too much hassle. You just have to be willing to park on another level from the Target entrance. With four levels, it should be a good amount of parking even whenif a business moves into the vacant location under the Target."
1,"I love to dance.  Love it.nnA friend recommended Krave and he got a giant thank you when I returned from Las Vegas.nnI was able to secure a free pass from the folks on the street.  The drinks arent cheap but my Mai Tais were exellent.  The music, crowd and go go dancers were AMAZING.nnI went by myself, had enough family time and I was quickly adopted by some nice fellas.  We danced for hours, and when they left I kept going.nnKrave  you are AWESOME.  Thanks for robbing me of a good night sleep.  My time in Las Vegas was way better because of you.nnXOXO"
1,"This place was a nice stop. I only fill my Mercedes up with Chevron gas. I think it lasts me longer and makes my car run better, so Ill pay a few extra cents for it.nnAnyways, we came in for two Red Bulls and two Double Shot Starbucks Coffees. The lady told us the two tall cans of Red Bull were on sale for  for both and then she let us know that it was cheaper to buy the bigger glass Frappuccinos by Starbucks. But then we let her know that these ones were stronger and light with less calories. She then was like oh, well I dont know about all that stuff..haha! I thought it was hilarious because she was a bigger girl making a joke.nnI like when you can get customer service with people actually helping you and joking around. Great experience for a gas station!"
1,"Awesome little yoga studio with a very friendly staff! The class size was tiny and the instructor was able to give good oneonone coaching. My downward dog still sucks, so I need all the coaching I can get.nnUnfortunately I am not familiar with pricing here, so I am unable to comment on that."
1,"Echo Canyon is no joking matter. Come dressed comfortably, bring plenty of water and if you can, come early to beat the sun. Its a terrible idea to be looking up into blinding sunshine. Finding a place to securely place your hands and feet is already a daunting task. Doing it while somewhat limited in sight? That blows. Wear really good shades.nnWhen they say the parking fills up fast, they mean it here. The parking lot opens at sunrise. It fills up. ASAP. If youre ok with circling around the neighborhood to wait, good for you. Otherwise park nearby and LyftUber over. Its currently six bucks to Uber from th  Camelback. Meet your friends there and carpool. Have some brunch at Flower Child afterwards.nnI absolutely, positively loved this hike. Yes, its hard. But there is limited loose gravel to contend with. Yes, you are often scrambling around on your hands, or scooching on your butt, to get over a rock. A pair of climbing gloves would be awesome. Ascending the steep areas that are lined with a fence andor pole are difficult. People will end up lined up behind. Patient. Kind. Polite. This is Phoenix after all. You need to hold on for dear life.nnBut when you reach the top. Oh yes. You will feel like a Queen. Or a King  The view up here is amazing. Stunning. Dont be silly and attempt to take a selfie. Ask someone for heavens sake. How often do you get to do something so kick butt neat? Selfies are ridiculous.nnAlthough there are plenty of trail markers its not a clear ascent or decent. You will need to use your brain. You will need to judge each step. Do you switch back? Can you stretch that far? Are you strong enough to jump? Should you jump?nnProbably not. Youll either fall down causing a massive slide into other people. Or, just fall down a cliff.nnI completely understand how and why people end up on the news. You need to be careful. If night falls I honestly would just stop moving. I would wait for the morning and see if I had the energy to come down. Otherwise I wold wait. One can easily go off trail here with one step. PFfft! Down a ravine. Dont mess around. nnCome prepared and enjoy the view of a lifetime. Gotta love Phoenix!"
1,"I mean, its a two floor retail cathedral to the No.  soft drink in the world. Fun place with expensive memorabilia. The fun thing to do is on the second floor Tastes of the World  samples of soda around the world! Which was awesome. And Ive joined the Beverly Club youll see.nnFun stop on your walk on the strip. Enjoy the AC, have a Coke and a smile."

1,"What a cool spot for brunch!! Went here on a Sunday, and it was packed. I did get seated right away, thank you to the guy who held the door for me and let me cut him in line The chicken lollipops were VERY good. I cant explain the flavor, you need to try them for yourself! The employees were very friendly, the owner stopped by to make sure everything was going good. The inside doesnt feel like your in Vegas. It is more of a California vibe. Check it out!"
1,"On Dec th my boyfriend and I went to the fabulous Carniveno Italian Steak House located in the Palazzo Hotel. When we arrived we were treated with amazing service. We were seated in the back in the wine gallery, it was very romantic. Our server was very knowledgeable of all the food and wine. We had about six servers around our table who were at our beckon call. If you made eye contact with any of them they would rush to your table and ask if we needed anything. We had the DryAged BoneIn Ribeye for two people. The Ribeye was very large, tender, and flavorful. For our sides we had Sautueed Mixed Mushrooms with Spring Onions and Italian Broccoli with House Smoked Pork, which were both very good. The chief even sent his chief special to our table to try, which was stuffed cheese balls, that were delicious. Overall, my experience was amazing, this is a good restaurant for a special occasion such as anniversary, birthday, proposal etc. It is pricy so expect to dish out some money."
1,"I just finishing eating at Meritage with  of my friends. We also eat there a year ago when we were last in town. nnBoth times, we had the same waitress who was excellent, and both times we were very happy with quality and presentation of the food.nnWe would certainly recommend this restaurant as a steak house."
1,"I had never thought it possible. An actual Dim Sum place that conjures up memories of Chinatown SF? nnNo. I must be dreaming. Theres no way that I can get succulent Shumai, Steamed BBQ pork buns, Lotus wrapped rice, and fried Sesame Bean Curd balls in Phoenix, Arizona.nnLooking back, it did feel like a dream. Everything was right, even the dumpy decor, and ironically enough, a tv playing the PX infomercial in the background.  English was poorly spoken, as it should be, and the items are easily identified by pictures on the menu. nnSome oddities stood out, such as tripe, chicken feet, and shark fin, but I will save those for next time. nnWe got the typical items, including Chinese sausage buns, egg custard, and  cilantrowrapped noodles, and it was all tasty. While not the best Ive ever had, it was still delicious. Cheap too!nnBe adventurous, and go here. I fear that without support, this restaurant will fail due to its absolutely terrible location."
1,"Special combination prices on the menu, get two or three courses for one price. You can order a soup or salad and an entree and if you go for the three course a dessert. nnI ordered the two course with tomato bisque soup and chicken crepes.  I absolutely love the tomato bisque soup! They let you buy it by the quart if you want for an extra .  The crepes were a light and blanketed the grilled chicken and spinach with wonderful flavor.  It also comes with a salad, so the meal was complete for me, no dessert necessary.nnGood service, great food, good deals!"
1,"My sister, husband, and I went in after early dinner. It was completely unplanned but we were attracted to the quaint storefront. We purchased a crispy elephant earlike dessert sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar. It was glorious. I bought a piece of applewalnutcinnamon sugar cake with cream cheese frosting. It was delicious an moist. We also purchased freshly baked chocolate chip cookies. They were absolutely rich and scrumptious. The woman who was there an greeted us seemed like she might be the owner. She was sweet and very helpful. Great disposition. This is probably my favorite small bakery in Pittsburgh. Delightful."
1,"I did a lot of research before choosing to see Dr Sadre.  Her prior military experience and dental training in the Midwest made her the perfect choice, and her personality and professionalism were exactly what I was looking for.  My previous dentist had given me a multiple page printout of all the dental work that I needed to have done and I never did, and Dr Sadre was able to get my work done in  visits onlay and then  fillings so I trust her judgment. I usually am seen in a timely fashion and everyone is very friendly.  My son lost a filling and was able to be squeezed in right away for an urgent visit as well, so they do try to accommodate you.  I am glad to have found this office!"
1,"It gets  stars, only because the waitress did not refill my husbands diet coke.  nnWe arrived on a Sunday morning, a holiday weekend.  Not many choices for breakfast in our area.  We were greeted by a very friendly hostess, and the place was packed.  The staff were buzzing around, and seemed happy.nnWe waited about  minutes to be seated.  Or waitress came over right away, took our drink orders and came right back.  Took our food orders.  AND she is HAPPY!!!!  Very nice.  I ordered the BACADO Omlette  Bacon, Jack, Avocado and tomato omlette  served with potatoes and english muffin.  I ordered a side stack of buttermilk pancakes, to which our waitress suggested I sub the english muffin for the silver dollar pancakes and save the .  which I did.  nExcellent Breakfast.  My husband ordered the California Tuna  tuna salad on a croissant.  Also another tasty meal.  nnWe ordered and they brought it out in about  minutes  hot and fresh.  nnFriendly, fast service.  Good food."
1,"I like this store a lot!nnThis store saved me from having a meltdown. They have a good handful of selection for the current season of clothes. nnStore  clean, spacious, easy flow of getting to the clothes  as the space is already small itself.nnStaff  courteous and friendly. Doesnt badger me with getting anything. nnSelection  a mix of good and some. Every now and then I see something that piqued my interest. Last week, I was desperate for some outfits to wear to Cancun.. And as you can see in the picture, one of which  was all from KLa. I received a lot of compliments. nnPrice  decent! It is not bad for what you get. Although the jewelry is it bit pricey.. So I like to to browse through the sale section. nnHours  Im just happy they open on a Sunday."
1,"The food is good.  The ramen is the best thing on the menu... In my opinion.nnIm a single woman that goes out by myself often so the friendliness of the bartender and staff is really the most important thing to me.  I suspect that chris served me at the bar and he was attentive without being overbearing.  I would have given them  stars had he introduced himself though...nnIt was Josh, he remembered me and introduced himself so I revised to  stars"
1,"Found this seamstress on Yelp and since she wasnt too far from my house and had such great reviews, I decided to give her a try.  I am SO glad I did!!nnValentina has done everything from shorten a dress, take in some pants, repair a rip, reline a dress, etc. for me.  Her prices are incredible, her turn around time is great a few times she has worked hard to get me something I needed repaired right away, and she is extremely friendly.  I wont trust my repairs to anyone else!"
1,"Jake is amazing!!!!!!!! Friendly and trustworthy. Fixed my ac, changed my oil, and changed my spark plugs. He knew what was wrong when other places were giving me the run around!  Fair and reasonable prices. I cant recommend him enough! Im a customer for life!!!"
1,"Ive been here a couple times and I love it. Ive had pizza, salad, and the lasagna and all were amazing. Ive eaten inside but the tables are pretty close so I preferred eating outside. nnThe only reason I dont go here more often is cause its a little on the expensive side."
1,If you havent been to a chipotle you should. And if youre looking for a good one try this one! The staff has always been top notch and the food prepared exactly to specs. The times I have put in online orders they were always on time and the one time that it wasnt they gave me a free drink while I waited! The manager and employees all seem to enjoy their work and that always shows in a meal. Nothing but good things to say about this place!
1,"I have been going to this SAS for over  years.  I have never had a person treat me rudely or with disrespect.  The prices are amazing, and if you have time to dig, you can save lots of money shopping here.  Even notions are a fraction of the price you would pay at a large chain and the fabric is unique as well."
1,"Candy and more candy, not just a chocolate store but truly a Candy Shop with so many sweet smells and flavors.Not sure of what you want? Not to worry because you can sample it and then decide, the only problem then is deciding what not to take with you.nnI love chocolate but there were so many different flavors of taffy I was overwhelmed by them over the chocolate. Parents dont go in with your kids or they will see you acting like them wanting something of everything you remembered as a kid.nnThank you for a wonderful experience and putting another line on my budget for the month."
1,"This place kicks ass.  Im a huge fan of nonhippie vegetarian food.  I hate the idea that you have to just eat veggies all the time.  With the advances we made in soy products, it is nice to see someone really going to town with quality ingredients.nnSo I ordered the buffalo chicken poboy.  SOOO good.  Plus it came with fries.  Cant hate fries.  Its really hard to describe the texture of the sammie but it was exactly what I expected and it was brilliant.  I literally cant wait to go back.  I think I ask my wife every weekend if we can go.  Its so good."
1,"I love to find a great tasting steak and I did...   I ordered the the Porter House and it was well prepared as was our appetizer, salads,  sides.  The front of the house needs to work on service.  Our server was interrupted while at our table on several occasions and we had to wait way too long in between courses.  We were not offered pepper for our salads and when I did ask for pepper, it took forever for our server to find a peppermill because customers were taking them and they didnt have enough.   They need to buy a few peppermills for their servers that customers wont steal !"
1,"Its always great to find a place that will accommodate my wifes vegan diet  even if nothing on the menu comes close. This is such a place. The ever attentive waitress and my wife crafted a wonderful dish from various areas of the menu into a challenge for the chef  a challenge he met with flying colors. Oh, and my smoked salmon Benedict was right off the menu and delicious. A great experience!"
1,"Great subs, friendly service. Just as good as Neds, but Steves has root beer ice cream and you can watch them make the samiches. Never had a better sub than their  hot turkey on white with everything. Kids love their pizza boat too."
1,I love getting the mango chicken salad with a side of chips and guacamole when Im short on cash. When you buy something keep your receipt. There is usually a coupon on the receipt that expires in  days. When I use it my meal only comes out to like .. I also think their guacamole is the best out of all the fast food restaurants also give you a good amount of chips and guacamole.  Its good for about  people with big appetites. The salad is also very filling!
1,"I LOVE O  G. So much in fact, that I wouldnt mind moving in. Yes, its THAT good. nnSo first things first do not expect to arrive and saunter in to the table of your choice because thats not going to happen. O  G is packed all the time, and there is almost always a lineup to get in. That said, I usually go for breaky or lunch, so its possible that late afternoons is quieter but dont count on it. nnEverything is made fresh, daily, from the salads to the baked goods, to the amazing gingerlemon iced tea they really need to offer this in a larger size!. They make a mean latte, and also offer wine I think its organic, but Im not sure. As well, you can buy some of their spicy nuts and jams. The service is OK but not great. It can be very slow and the wait staff dont always think to come and check in once youve been seated so if youre in dire need of coffee, order while youre in line and you can get your fix while waiting for a table. nnMy favorites includenn salad  made with raw veggies, roasted peanuts, shallots, tofu, basil, cilantro and mint, served on rice noodles and accompanied by a lovely sweet and sour dressing. Now, the last time I was there I could swear the noodles were buckwheat but I could be making that up in my head.  Anyway, this salad is fresh and incredibly flavourful and leaves your belly feeling just right read room for dessert. nnThe Gustavo  holy mother of God, this is good. Garlic grainfed chicken, grilled onions, balsamic marinated portobello mushrooms, Havarti cheese and maple dijonnaise sauce. Wow. This sandwich can be pretty filling so you may have to take that dessert to go.  nnCajun Chicken sandwich  this one is also made with grainfed chicken and includes guacamole, cajun spices, tomatoes and mango. Equally as delicious as The Gustavo, but packs less of a punch which is not a bad thing!. Ill eat anything with avocado so this sandwich makes me feel all happy on the inside. nnSadly, since i have been tasked with avoiding wheat recently, I opted for the Viva Las Vegan sandwich on my last visit a great option for all you vegetarians and vegans out there. I loved this one and felt pretty stuffed by the time I was finished. Its got marinated tofu, dill pickles, hummus, caramelized onions, crushed olives, arugula and is served on organic bread. By the way  their breads are like a taste of Heaven, so fluffy and thick. Of course, I ate everything BUT the bread but we dont need to talk about that.nnIf youre a fan of chocolate like me, try their Extraordinary Brownie  or The Attack of the Killer Chocolate cookie triple chocolate, people!. Both are incredible and will satisfy any chocoholic. nnNow, GO!"
1,"I enjoyed my lunch to the max! Yes, the prices are a little steep but its well worth it. The burgers our huge and so tasty. The only complain I have is I asked for my burger well done it there was still some pink in it. It wasnt a big deal, but I prefer my meat done well. The fries are amazing as well! I was surprised by how many I got in an order."
1,The carne asada is excellent as well as the marinated chicken breasts. Always taste amazing and still easy to order even though I dont know any spa is at all. Prices are a little high and that to me is the only drawback. Id definately recommend shopping here for carne asada and other authentic Mexican foods
1,"I went here to get my serpentine belt replaced and a transmission flushed and these guys were friendly and efficient.  They took the time to explain things to me and I felt comfortable that they were making the appropriate recommendations without trying to charge me for things I didnt need.  It was ready in just a few hours as promised so I was able to pick it up same day.  Only complaint is that they left my transmission fluid dipstick out of place under the hood so it was just laying on top, but fortunately it didnt fall down and screw up anything since it was laying flat on the top, but if it had that couldve been a more serious problem.  So I subtracted a star for that since it seemed a bit careless."
1,"aw i feel a bit bad that this nandos seems to have gotten some mediocre reviews.  i, for one, LOVE some nandos!  and this place was perfect when the boyfriend and i were looking for a lateish night bite to eat.  nnit was coming up to pm on a saturday night and we both were starving for dinner!  i was hoping something would be open along george vi bridge and lo and behold, the welcoming lights of Nandos!!  we entered and i was surprised that for pm this place was fairly busy.  however we were shown to a seat quickly and the waiter confirmed that we knew how the ordering system, etc worked.nnat this point i dont even bother to look at the menu as i always order the same thing and i can confirm that the halluomi and portabello pita was just as good as it always is.  in fact it was probably better than usual as i was a bit tipsy and starving!  the coleslaw was tasty and the chips freshly made.  so all in all a really good meal for less than a tenner.  the boyfriend was equally happy with his chicken wrap.nni felt that the service was quick and attentive and honestly i cant think of anything negative to say.  especially as this place was still seating people when we left closer to pm!  yay for a proper late night meal"
1,"Best pizza downtown hands down!! Had it in a drunken night on Fremont, but had to come back on a sober trip to make sure it was as good as I thought it was. It was!! Wish parking was easier though."
1,"I dont like whisky. Usually when I go to a place that has a speciality Im not that fussed about read coffee I find it a bit of an average experience. nnBut the good thing about this place is you dont need to like whisky to appreciate the decor, atmosphere, great food and helpful staff. Walking into the place made me feel like I needed to be in a smoking jacket at the turn of the century. But in a good way!nnThere are tonnes of whiskies to choose from. I didnt have any. But I hear they are excellent and go from cheap to blow your socks off expensive.  So if youre into a wee dram or two this is probably the place to come!"
1,"I stayed here back in December and wish it was warmer outside to be able to enjoy the pool. No worries. Everything about the room was fantastic. The bathroom was huge, the shower was big and the bed was probably the most comfortable bed Ive ever slept on. I liked that they had video craps and roulette. The dinner buffet was excellent. It didnt make me feel over stuffed and tired like other buffets tend to.  for a buffet per person is a little steep, but the food was VERY good. I thought the place was very nice over all and Ill totally go back soon."
1,"Im so glad that everyone here speaks exceptional English. I always have difficulty with most Asianowned salons due to the language barrier but thankfully thats not the case here. I called around  on a Sunday to ask if they have an opening in the next hour or two. They told me to come around . I came earlier than my appt and saw that the two ladies were both working on customers, but in less than  minutes was immediately taken care of. nnI got Kim, who reminded me of those friendly Korean auntie. She was sweet and she understood exactly what I wanted, she even gave advice on how to make the cut compliment my face shape better. nnThe end result looked good, and without even asking she put layers in, which to me was the winning move that will make me come back again. Haircuts start at , I paid  plus tip for mine which is at least  cheaper than the other salons Ive been to. nnYup, I think Ive found my new goto salon"
1,"One of my favorite hang outs with the family! Love the Pides and the salads! Our favorite is the Green Eggs and Ham! Yes, its called that and it is soooo good! The food tastes very fresh and it is definitely one of the best healthy restaurants to eat!"
1,"I met a friend here for brunch on Sunday and Im still telling everyone I know about Cork.  The cashier at the grocery store, check.  The mailman, check.  The toddlers teachers, check.  I swear I must have drank the kool aid because I have to spread the word.  nnFirst of all complimentary mimosas and bellinis.  Decent ones too at that.  Combine that with a tasty breakfast sandwich for my friend she decided on it before we even got there and I settled on the special of the day, a green chili pork tostada.   While her sandwich looked good, I only had eyes for my own.  Three layers of fresh, fried corn tortillas layered with green chili pork, refried beans, fresh salsa, cheese and topped with creamy scrambled eggs.  I swear I could have started thumping my foot on the ground the way a dog does when you rub their stomach just right.  It was that good.  Really.nnWe were first to arrive at  am and left well after .  We never felt rushed or that we were being pushed out.  In fact, the entire time we sat and talked, our waiter kept coming by and topping off our champagne.  Why cant more restaurants expect people to sit around and talk for a while?  In a sense, it was more like a meal in a European restaurant that we could take as long as we wanted.  No one was constantly opening the bill and asking if we wanted change.  We were just left in peace.nnI plan on working Cork into my restaurant repertoire.  The quality, customer service and price arent often seen together.  Its probably a little out of the way it is for me but it is truly worth it."
1,"This review is of the conference facilities only I did not stay in a room. This conference venue is in a very convenient location! There is a lot of parking as well.nnThe interior is fresh, clean, and modern. There are many places to sit and relax in the walkways or outside. In addition, the walkways were very spacious and allowed groups to gather and visit comfortably while still allowing plenty of space for others to move around. nnThe catered lunches were good. They also have a very nice buffet style breakfast in the mornings complimentary for the guests and  to purchase. nnNo free WiFi. Bummer.nnMost important amenity was the womens bathrooms...they were everywhere and plenty of stalls! Always clean and everything by motion sensor. Thank you, Embassy, for making this a priority!"
1,"So bear in mind that this review was for the Friday night at the end of my audition rotation with UNSOMs chair fo surgery, a day of interviewing with each and every faculty on the department, and weeks of busting my ass getting up at  am... I was ready to party up huge and put some cash on the table, and Wisconsin D was visiting from Cali, so you know we were ready to  do it up big. nnGuys, just suck it up and go for bottle service  this is Vegas, and who wants to wait in line? Dave and I picked up a couple bottles and strolled in to our table on the transparent terrace above the dance floor. nnService at our table was great and how gorgeous was the girl taking care of us? Vegas gorgeous, as youd expect for the money youre putting down. The music was fun, dancable, not so loud that we couldnt hold a quiet conversation with the ladies at the next table, and not so poppy as to be annoying. The ratio control was great, so Wisconsin D and I took full advantage of the VIP table, and we ultimately wound up leaving with the ladies with their own table across the terrace...nnOverall, a fun place to dance, chat up some gorgeous ladies, see some beautiful pageantry the HUGE bottles of champagne, the artificial snow showers, etc etc and generally get drunk as hell and get laid. nnhad a great time blowing off steam and partying it up, but you have to come in with the expectation that its cash on the table time  this is a bizarrely classist place, with those getting a table and bottles in one class, and the havenots in another. nnMy previous experiences coming here without a table have actually been alright, although in that case I avoid the super crowded dance floor and beeline for either of the two bars. In this case, if youre looking to meet someone for a hook up as I was on those nights, you will be dependant entirely on looking good and being razorsharp on your game, as the ratio is much less forgiving. nnIf youre a girl, of course, this doesnt matter as youll probably get invited to someones table and escorted to the private area by security. nnIn summary, I would probably not come here without bottle service, as youll just wait in line FOREVER unless youre a hot girl obviously! or know someone and have a hook up  although in this case, while you do avoid the line, youd better be one predatory snake in the grass, because its definitely welcome to the jungle time...."
1,"Great back patio on a sunny day.  Super dog friendly  water bowls, dog treats, and welcoming staff, so our labrador was a comfortable part of our dining party.  Chill atmosphere, very friendly if a tad disjointed service, good beer list, and we really liked our dishes veggie burger and chile verde pork tacos.  Ill come back without a doubt."
1,"Im a big fan of the Signature  MGM Grand.  The Better Half and I spent a few days here and absolutely loved it.  Heres whynn Large whirlpool tubs with jets.  Very relaxing, nice touch.nn Balcony facing the Strip.  There arent too many places in Vegas with a balcony.  We were on the rd floor and had a great view of the Strip.nn Comfortable bed.  We slept well during our entire stay.nn Kitchenette.  We didnt use it, but it is a nice amenity to have.nn Privacy.  These towers are not attached to the MGM Grand.  There is a long walkway that connects it to the property.  Each tower has its own swimming pool and there is a small lounge in the Tower we stayed in, which was the center tower.  There is also a private valet entrance for each tower.nn st class treatment.  We were treated well by every employee.  They helped make our stay pleasant.nnReturn Factor"
1,"These guys fix your botched repair from other shops! If you need a repair on your device, save your time, money   like in my case your device, by coming straight to iFly. They lack all the shady behavior you get from other shops. They open your device in front of you, show you whats wrongneeds replacing,  give you a fair price to do it! In my case, I had a repair done at a shop that is causing my motherboard problems  can only expect it to continue to get worse. So, after getting my sad little budget, they are on the hunt for a new phone for me that theyll warrantee! If I could give these guys  stars, I would. At this rate, Ill NEVER take any of my devices anywhere else. You shouldnt either."
1,"Great service.  Nice ambiance.nnSo glad they have kids meals now.  Last time I was there long time ago they didnt.  So your child can eat for between . and ., including a drink.nnThe happy hour is decent.  I had a coconut lemon drop YUM for , hubby had a large sake for .  Plus I shared the edamamme and tofu potstickers with my girls.  There are three small ones for . but they are GOOD.nnOne child had the lo mein with tofu, one had buhddas feast with tofu.  The buhddas feast was just steamed carrot, broccoli and sugar snap peas.  The rice and sauce she got sweet  sour was on the side.nnMy birthday boy ordered off the gluten free menu and had the mongolian beef.  He scarfed it down.  Hubby had gluten free spicy chicken.  It wasnt hot enough for him so he added more pepper sauce but he did enjoy it.nnI had the vegetarian spicy eggplant.  It was DELICIOUS.  . and I couldnt even finish it.nnFor my sons birthday they brought him a free mini dessert.  He chose triple chocolate mousse.  Usually they are . each.nnTotal bill was ."
1,". rounded to .nnCame here for lunch on a wednesday at . Stood at the counter for a bit looking at the menu. Looks like you order your food and are given a number. You go sit at whatever table is available. They give you a cup for whatever drink you ordered. Water is free of course. You get your drinks yourself.nnI go with the Wild Burger .. A half pound charbroiled Angus Beef Patty topped with Tillamook Cheddar Cheese, Lettuce, Tomato, Signature Slaw, Onions, and Pickle Planks on a Brioche Bun. Comes with a basket of fries.nnI ordered the burger medium rare. When it came out, it was closer to medium which was still ok it was still pretty juicy with every bite. The half pound patty is no joke. Lots of good flavor with all the ingredients mentioned above. As for the fries. It was ok. Nothing to write home about.nnNext time I think I just might order some wings for the guy at the next table ordered what looked like a dozen. Im assuming he got some kind of barbeque flavor for the aroma that filled the air as the server walked by my table temporarily cancelled out the smoke smell coming from the casino.nnSpeaking of smoke, is it too much to ask for the open area leading out to the casino to be sealed somehow? Im pretty sure most if not all people dont want their food to taste like cigarettes. This is a major negative for me. I think maybe next time I will try to sit all the way in the back.nnGood things are that they are  hours, all the condiments that you will ever need are on all the tables, you get your drinks yourself so no waiting for the server, and there are tvs all around so if there is a big game chances are that it is on that channel.nnIn closing, I have been told the other locations have their differences as well like not as smoke heavy as this place so I just might have to check those places out as well. As for this location, I guess eating here occasionally should not be an issue.nnYelp   Review Challenge  If the place was on fire, would you be able to tell from the smoke?"
1,"Went to Canters for a simple meal one evening. You order and pay at the front counter and they bring your food out to you. I had a pastrami sandwich combo that came with fries and a soda. The sandwich was piled high with thinly sliced pastrami on nice fresh rye bread. You have your choice of mustard at the table to use along with other condiments. It tasted quite good and I downed every bite of it. The fries that came with were quite thin and piled high on the plate. I usually like nice thick steak fries the best, but these thin ones were some of the best Ive ever had. You WILL be full if you clean your plate. My wife had the same combo with corned beef that was pretty tasty too. At . for a combo Id say it was a pretty good value for the a big Strip casino too. Ill be back to try some of their other sandwiches."
1,"Although Ive only eaten here a couple of times the only times that Ive experienced shabu shabu and gotten two different dishes, I have thoroughly enjoyed their lunch menu.  The fact that they offer a free beer, soft drink, or tea was pretty enticing.nnThe salad, although simple, was pretty good.  By good, I mean fresh, and that the leaves and tomato slices werent drowning in their dressing.  It helped that the waitress kept coming to our table again and again to ask if we wanted our salad replenished.  nnThe waitress was very helpful and informative in explaining the way that the food was to be cooked, in demonstrating the proper way to cook the food and to clear the pots for cooking, as well as explaining the different uses for each dipping sauce.nnWe didnt order anything other than the usual entrees chicken  chicken, chicken  meat, but they did seem also generous with the amount of vegetablesthe usual bean sprouts, noodles, tofu, etc.  nnSince my dad has a pacemaker and was unable to stay within close proximity of the cooking area, the waitress ended up preparing the food for him. nnWe ended up getting two rounds of vegetables, on top of the two rounds of salads.nnThe only gripe that I have is that there werent bigger portions of the beef or chicken, in comparison to the price that we paid.nnAt least we were given some lunch vouchers for  off our next visit.  nnOverall, great experience each time.  The portions, however, left me wanting more."
1,My husband I have been to Hanks a few times and each time we have loved it. In  we went for our  yr wedding anniversary and again the food and service were excellent. I love there cream corn and steaks. At the end of the meal they brought us a mini cheesecake with a small white chocolate Happy Anniversary on top. It also tasted great. I would definitely recommend this place to friends and family. Thank you Hanks for making our anniversary special.
1,"Love this BAR for my NY Giant games that arent on local TV...food is great, plenty to drink  the BEST are the speakers for the tables so you can listen to your team!nnLadies bring a sweatshirt for the AC...gets really chilly!"
1,"Finding clever gifts are always so tough. This place has the coolest, super odd, quirky things that can please even that weird cousin you have when you just dont know what to get her. I stumbled across this store while killing time, and walked out with an armful of gifts for friends. There are sort of themes around the store. Youve got a section for kids, designy people, geeks, women, the lot. Just find a theme and go with it."
1,"Went here with three friends. We each tried the miso, shoyu and shio ramen. Soooo bomb. Came here hungover and dehydrated hahaha felt like a boss leaving the place.nnFood was amazing. Great staff and environment. The wait time was a little big longer than usual given that we came in pretty late around ish in the afternoon.nnCraving was definitely satisfied although hundred miles away from home!"
1,"What a great little antique store in Phoenix, AZ.  One of the first things that I noticed about this little shop is that IT SMELLS GOOD!!!  The place is clean and well kept  not like many of the typical antique shops.  Kudos to the owner, Gary for maintaining such a pleasurable shop!nnThe shop is filled with tons of goodies  raning from turquoise jewelry, lamps, periodera memorabilia, photos, etc.  While in Phoenix, I visited over  antique shops, and this one took the cake!  Prices are reasonable, and the customer service is outstanding!  Very pleasant to deal with and no pushy salespeople.nnI went in looking for a turquoise cowboy belt buckle, and left with some snazzy Zuni Indian turquoise cufflinks.  SNAZZY!nnHighly recommended!"
1,"LOVE this place!!!!!!!!! My husband and I discovered it while driving through Del Taco on Dysart. A few weeks later, my husband came home with pulled pork bbq, and sweet potato casserole. TO.DIE.FOR. I have since gone back and gotten bbq chicken fantastic, meat fell off the bones, and still tender, and macncheese very homey, breaded crust, pepper, lots of cheese, perfect. Ill be back soon for more sweet potato casserole. The people there were very friendly too!"
1,"Looks scary from the outside, but it is good! I take out way more than I dine in. Every time I order take out, no matter how much I order, it always takes about ten minute nnThe fried rice is the best around, not greasy, just delicious!! I personally like the pork or combo fried rice the best. Huge portion! nnOther faves are happy family, hot and spicy shrimp, and tungting shrimp."
1,"After reading the reviews about the line and wait, we got here at about  on a Saturday morning and were seated right away. The menu is extensive and I was having a hard time choosing what to get. After some thought, I went with the strawberry pancakes and scrambled eggs. Breakfast sausage came with it but that went to my husband. He ordered a breakfast sandwich, after seeing the amazing bread it came on. One thing I liked was that they were really accommodating with making things just the way you want. My husband wanted scrambled eggs on his breakfast sandwich and that wasnt a problem! Service was quick and our food arrived shortly.nnMy pancakes were delicious, however I was disappointed with the strawberriesthey were FROZEN! Well, thawed out but a mushy, prefrozen strawberry mess! I understand this is a diner, but I guess in June I was just expecting some fresh strawberries. The eggs were good, nothing spectacular. My husband enjoyed his breakfast sandwich but said the sausage that came with mine was tough and he didnt eat much of it. We were in and out in less than  minutes.nnOverall, it was a decent breakfast, but I would definitely order something different if I were to return. The service was fast and friendly, but I would have been disappointed if we had waited awhile for that breakfast."
1,"Known for their steakhouses, the Mastro Groups seafood house in upscale Kierland Commons offers an overwhelming choice of seafood dishes...in addition to their extensive menu they had about  specials on the night I ate there.  I opted for the surf and turf...a oz filet and huge alaskan king crab legs.  The filet was to die for one of the best steaks Ive ever eaten and the crab legs were awesome.  They have an excellent wine list and a hoppin bar scene.  The excellent food does come at a high price ."
1,Love the food and its a great price. The food as yet to dissatisfied me! Its always very quick too if youre on a lunch break. Very clean environment and nice outside patio for nice days when you want to sit somewhere clean and non crowded.
1,My family has certain affection for this restaurant. It does a good job serving healthy ThaiAsian dishes. My favorite is the Jungle Curry Dish. It is great for families since its often not busy. Most of their business comes from phoned in orders and pickups which they are very quick on. They expanded the restaurant last year so theres lots of seating. The decor is bland but clean. The staff is friendly and accommodating. Please try this restaurant. Its a diamond in the rough.
1,"Aura has always been a good solid place. Ive never gotten my hair done there, but go for waxingfacialsetc whenever Im home. A solid brazilian for , that was as painless as these go, quick, and with a super nice esthetician? Sign me up."
1,Had outstanding Service. Have never had such a great haircut. Never had anyone give me such great service. Cant wait to come get my color next week. Just the nicest guy. Rodney Gentry surpassed all my expectations.
1,"Came here on a Thursday night during a rush and were seated on the patio our preference within  minutes. We had the pleasure of having Danny as our severhe was fabulous!! Attentive, fun, and charming. Do yourself a favorcome here and enjoy a delicious margarita and live music!"
1,"I was back in Vegas for a trade show. We didnt want to wait an hour for Texas De Brazil, so my boss and a guest asked me about that sushi place you rave about off we went to Oyshi! My boss AND our guest are sushi snobs and all the way there they voiced their concerns. As soon as the appetizers were done and our first rolls served, they were hooked and raved about the great rolls and how they will be back themselves! Thank You Oyshi Sushi for making me a hero!"
1,"This place is pretty much packed all the time. I have tried going on tuesday nights, wednesday nights  you can get a table, usually, but its still really busy. I avoid it completely on friday  saturday nights now. People spend  hours at the bar waiting for their table and by the time dinner comes theyre loaded. Its something you only want to deal with if youre drunk yourself. nnThe sushi is incredibly hit and miss here. Ive been there and had tuna sashimi that was just perfect, and the next time I go back its so awful I cant eat it. So I dont go here for sushi anymore. nnI like the teppanyaki tables where they cook in front of you. Im a huge fan of the sea bass. The kobe beef is also fantastic... when I can afford it! lol  I think the teppanyaki food is very well done and thats what I get when I come here.nnOther great dishes are the kobe burger, and the wasabi shrimp cocktail."
1,I work right down the street from this restaurant and its great everytime.  The staff is alwasy so nice.  The food always tastes freash.  i definitely recommend a visit if youre in the mood for Mexican.
1,"After my first dining experience at Becketts Table I have absolutely NOTHING I could complain about. The food is amazing. They had dishes that were creative yet homey.  The chefowner is extremely talented but also very nice and personable. The servers were very kind, helpfulknowledgable, and on task. The food is a little expensive but its well worth the price. They also have an excellent wine selection!nnI cant wait to go back!!"
1,"Was a little iffy about the place at first soups arent really my thing especially ramen. But was really surprised by how amazing it tasted not your ordinary ramen noodles you live off in college and while sick that I remember. nnNothing really special about the places look. Just a little hole in a place next to Walgreens, but well priced and worth a try. nnHighly recommend the honey garlic chicken appetizer....amazing. Craving it again as I speak."
1,"Its pretty good. nnOne time they did have a sign in the line that said,  minutes from this point, like they were disneyland or something. nnBut the burgers are good, and the fries. and the cheesy sauce is good for dipping."
1,"Hidden in the corner of a strip mall near Food  Less is an unassuming Ethiopian restaurant.  The redyellowgreen signage illuminates the restaurants name and its cuisine.nnWalking in, this was probably one of the nicest Ethiopian restaurants in town.  The modern furniture immediately sets the tone, along with a bar on the right and a small stage area in the back.nnOn a Saturday night, we were the only customers.  We werent concerned though because our previous experiences at other Ethiopian restaurants have always left us in the minority.nnQueen of Shebas menu is very limited  with only  items.  Of course, we knew exactly what we wanted and they definitely had it.nn. Kitfo Lean red chopped beef minced, blended and delicately seasoned in hot spice. .  We made a point of saying we wanted it raw, and again, the eyebrows were raised.  And when it arrived, it was slightly warmed and tasted just divine.  The portion was quite generous and we agreed, this was probably the best kitfo weve had so far! nn. Vegetarian Combo A combination of split lentil peas, cabbage and potatoescarrots and fresh salad. .  It arrived with green and red lentils, yellow beans, steamed cabbage, and string beans.  The waitress asked if we wanted cheese, which we definitely did, and we also asked for the red chili powder.  There wasnt any fresh salad, but we could care less because their red and green lentils were so good here.  They had good spices mixed in, and we were loving it. The yellow beans were really good too.  The string beans and steamed cabbage are okay, as they were the same as the other restaurants.  We agreed that they do their legumes really well here, and probably would just order a plate of the red lentils on its own, or even the green lentils or yellow beans.nnService was fine  one waitress who took care of us the whole time.  She was pleasant, but we had some language barriers about ordering water which eventually worked itself out.  She came by to check on us and brought out more injera when she saw we were getting low.  The bathrooms could use a bit of a cleanup, the mens room smelled like urine and the womens room had graffiti and lacked toilet paper and paper towels.  nnOverall, Queen of Sheba is one of our fave Ethiopian restaurants of the five we tried.  With their limited menu, it may be challenging for newbies.  But they offer the staples we like, and well probably return when we crave raw beef!nnPer their website, they offer live reggae on Friday nights."
1,"Had a couple of dinners at Alex over the last couple of years. Richly appointed  didnt miss the Vegas neon lights  dining room. Lots of space well designed, tall ceilings like I am on the French Riviera, opulent ooops I said it again, but in an old world kinda way. Food was excellent and well paced, fantastic presentation, polished service. nnDefinitely NOT a place to go if you are a fan of  Vegas buffets, or if you think Chanterelle Mushrooms were named after your first girl friend. They take the attire thing seriously, which keeps out the stained tank top crowd although the pricing takes care of that as well. Had a funny encounter the first time at Alex when the hostess not the Maitre de greeted us and looked up and down. My friend was wearing a stunning embroidered silk  Versace outfit with open toe, admittedly kinda sandal like Armani shoes.  Maybe a fashion fopah sp? to wear Versace with Armani, but hey this is Vega, not Milan. These were not  flip flops . Hostess very seriously said, Im sorry but no open toe shoes are allowed at Alex.  My friend very seriously and calmly said, please bring the manager to me. Mr Manager appears and kindly instructed the hostess to go check on something.  Apologizing, saying they are working on the training folks like her. The wait staff  and dining experience are superior."
1,"I came here after a good friend said that I cant leave Arizona without eating here first.   I dragged my boss here during a business trip, and we had the foie gras and soufflue after reading the reviews on Yelp!.  We were so glad we came!  The food was fantastic!  We had such a great experience that my boss kept talking about the food the next day. Its small, but since the weather was nice we were able to sit outside and not worry about being too hot.   Please note if the waiter suggests any wines with the dinner, I suggest you follow his advice.  He really knows his stuff."
1,"My girlfriend and I went to Sushisamba for a late lunch the other day.  I ordered the rio grande churrasco plate and a mojito from the bar.nnThe churrasco was very tasty and its a good portion.  It comes with  different types of meat, rice and beans with some greens and three variations of chimichuri.  nnI would Definatly recommend eating at Sushisamba!"
1,"Ok these people really do it right.  Its a long line on the weekends, but well worth it.  I cant say enough good things about the toasted marshmallow, but just get it!  Love the waffle bowls!  Unique flavors of ice cream!  The vegan chocolate was amazing!  Excellent quality!  Need one in Chandler!"
1,"I originally found this salon on Groupon so I wasnt expecting the best. But I was pleasantly surprised by the friendly staff, great selections and most of all beautiful nail designs! Ive been going to see Cindy for over a year and she is the best. She will do any crazy design I find on Pinterest, she stays late when she knows Im coming from work and she genuinely remembers and cares about all of her clients. Ive never left disappointed and anyone who does, doesnt know how to express their needs. Im very picky and I have no issue speaking up if I dont like color or design. And Cindy is so gracious and will fix anything I dont like. She knows me so well now that I dont even have to tell her what I want. nnThe salon is clean and let me tell you... The BEST pedicures. They use a nice peach scrub to exfoliate your legs and give a fantastic massage and then theyll use a hot wet towel to wipe off the lotion so youre not greasy. nnI highly recommend getting a gel manicure AND gel pedicure. My pedicure lasts  weeks and my manis usually last at least  weeks. nnI get so many compliments on my nails and I can only thank the girls at Harmony Salon for taking pride in their work. They have a forever client with me and Im sure youll feel the same way once you go. nnPrices are reasonable and products are high quality."
1,"If youre seeking some delicious, lowcal treats at SouthPark Mall, Yoforia is your jam. This particular location can get mighty packed on weekends, but the line moves uber fast. nnA few things to be aware of...nn They charge by the ounce, so if youre being all gluttonous, youre going to pay for it, literally. n The toppings are fab. Everything from Butterfinger bits to Captain Crunch to a smattering of fresh fruit. n The employees here are super nice and will always ask if youd like to sample anything. Sweet! nnMy personal favorite combo is a small swirl of dark chocolate, cheesecake and peanut butter topped with chocolate chips and a dusting of Butterfinger bits. Or, perhaps Ill go all healthy with coconut fro yo, coconut shavings and fresh pineapple. I dont know...its a game time decision!"
1,"Handsdown the best hotel experience Ive had in Vegas.nnFrom the moment we stepped in to the hotels Tower  building, we knew that this wasnt a typical Vegas hotel. For starters, the lobby smelled like a Spa with fresh orchids on the front desk.nNo casino. No obnoxious guests milling around with cigarettes and drinks. Just a very peaceful atmosphere. nnEvery single member of staff was friendly and accommodating, but also discreet. The valet guys and women on the front desk were charming. Samples of peach champagne en route to our room.nNo cleaning woman banging on your door at am.nJust perfect.nnThe gym was moderately sized, clean and uncrowded, with modern wellmaintained equipment. Loved the food at the cafe in Tower   really fresh and made with care. Can highly recommend the roast beef sandwich!nnWe absolutely loved our suite on floor . Fantastic views of the Strip. Great jacuzzi bath tub big enough for two, as well as a huge shower and separate toilet room. nOne of comfiest hotel beds Ive stayed in a long time!nnI can pretty much guarantee Ill be staying here again next time I head to Las Vegas..."
1,Craig Road Animal Hospital is the only vet I trust. The professional doctors and trained friendly staff are always prepared and ready for any emergencies. They saved my Piggys life and immediately jumped into action to start treating him. I bring both my pitbulls they love Dr.Daniels. She always makes me feel better too. When we would visit we would get the red carpet entry thru the back so we dont have to disturb other visitors. My dogs are aggressive to other animals and I could not find muzzles to fit them. Craig Road ordered me some so we could safely visit thru the front entrance. They offer all kinds of specials work with u financially and really do care! Thank you Craig Road Animal Hospital!
1,"Ive been to about a dozen different froyo places, and I still use Cocomero as my gold standard. Nothing beats this place! The vast variety of flavors, the great taste, the decor, the price  everything!nnIm dying to head back to Chambana just so I can get a mere spoonful of my peach flavored froyo. You would not believe how difficult it is to find that flavor anywhere else, let alone some of their other ones, such as Kahlua and Baileys Irish Cream. See what I mean by VAST variety of flavors? No one else comes close!"
1,"This place is a very nice destination type resort.  Its about  miles from the Strip but provides complimentary shuttle service to the Strip, shopping and the airport.  The casino is nice, tons of slots and table games.  I did not gamble much but those that did seem to enjoy losing their money.  I remind people that they dont build these places because they lose.  The food is pretty good, with lots of options and the drink prices are reasonable.  For a weekend getaway without the insanity of the strip, this is a good pick."
1,"Buffets are really a must when visiting Vegas. Ive had my share of good, bad and very bad Wynn is good along with a higher pricetag nnWe arrived around pm and was pleasantly surprised  that there wasnt a long line. We waited for about  minutes at most. This buffet was pretty good, but my advice would be to stick to the American food. Their sushi didnt look appealing at all and their asian selection consisted of  dishes only. nnThe prime rib and lamb are a must and so is their dessert section!"
1,I walked into this jeweler at  am and asked if they could remove a link from my watchband.  The man at the counter was able to take care of it immediately and only charged !  Very professional and personable.  I look forward to using this place for all of my jewelry repair issues in the future.
1,"I have become a Windsor addict. I love the complimentary valet but seriously, still leave a tip for the guys! and the decor is effortlessly cool. The atmosphere is hip and trendy, but the true star is still the food. I love their fondue appetizer and their burgers are phenomenal! Their drinks look amazing and Ill be back to try them once Im not pregnant anymore! Windsor is my go to place to take out of town guests, no one has been disappointed yet."
1,"As I was out doing some Christmas shopping, I noticed a new business on Stephanie. It was a Rhapsodielle, which is a store that sells womens clothing, mainly trendy clubwear, at rather low prices. nnThis Rhapsodielle is much larger then the one on Serene, and it makes a world of difference with regard to your shopping experience. The shoe section is fantastic, with many sizes out and ready to be tried on. One of my biggest annoyances with the Serene location was how difficult it was to get an employee to help find sizes for shoes. This location seemed to have more employees working then the other as well... nnThe quality of the clothing hasnt changed, its still not that great... But the items are very inexpensive. I didnt try anything on since I wasnt technically supposed to be shopping for myself... I will definitely be back."
1,"Here on holiday for Thanksgiving with family.   Great to get out of the noise and smoke of casino for an nice breakfast   one that doesnt cater to the masses.   nI came alone and sat at the counter and was able to watch the work of the cooks and the staff. nAll freshhomemade ingredients, uptone setting, wonderful host that walks the tables to make sure everything is okay.  Very very nice staff.  You can tell the ownermanager works hard to make sure it is a great experience.  nIll be back."
1,"My husband took me to Isabelas for my birthday a couple of weeks ago.  It was absolutely perfect.  Though, I would recommend getting reservations in advance.  We did the prix fixe menu and wine flight, which ran us a bit over .  I have to say that it was worth it.  The wait staff is amazing, the food was to die for, and the owner stopped by to take a photo of us.  But, the best part was the view.  It was incredible.  Even if you just stop in for dessert or an appetizer, you should definitely go just to see the amazing view."
1,"I could have sworn I had Rallys before in my lifetime, but after I tried those fries, there is no way that I had it before because I definitely would have remembered it! The fries are THE BEST! The burger wasnt anything special, definitely can settle for burger king since it isnt much of a difference. They really do have a lot to choose from, but I doubt if Ill try, I gag at the thought of a chili cheese burger..eek nnFurthermore, I will be back for more fries!"
1,Adam is a true professional and perfectionist! He was prompt and courteous and took his time on the tint job. You can tell he really knows his stuff. The car came out beautifully and by far the best tint job Ive ever had on a car. He is more than worth his cost.
1,"Went to Caseys for lunch. It was nice enough to sit outside but hey, I love sitting at the bar. At night it is thick with bar flies but around noon, there are some, but you can still find seating. The bar tender, while looking very much in the way of the establishment, would be right at home at a top end hotel with his level of service. Being lunch, I cant drink against company policy but they have great ice tea and the bar keep, keeps it filled  while so many other places let you languish with an empty glass.nnMy friend and I had two of the specials which they write on a board by the side of the bar, the Boss Hog which is, I think, a rib eye fillet on a toasted hoagie with melted blue cheese and a balsalmic reduction. I know, sounds pretty gosh darn fancy and it is as good as it sounds. The other selection was the open faced, pan grilled, meatloaf sandwich with grilled onions and melted cheddar cheese. Frankly, a bit dry, the meatloaf needs to be more moist.nnThe total bill was about  and with tip, came to about  so pretty good for a sit down meal with wait service and endless ice tea. Ive spent many a long night on the patio drinking glass after glass of their various beer selections but sometimes just a noalcohol lunch at the bar is a great thing as well."
1,"We go here for lunch every time we visit my Mom in Arizona.  We always get the same thing because we love it so much.  The Asparagus Soup to start and also a Cesar salad.  Then we get the  cheese pizza and my mom makes her own combo pizza.  It is so good.  It is Italian pizza if you like that style.  It is just hard to find it made like this anywhere.  Cant say much about anything else there, but if you go this route you will be very happy."
1,"Leute... das ist nen Springbrunnen!? Sicher... nen biudfchen auudfergewufhnlich ist er schon aber das man da so abgehen kann?! Vielleicht haut es mich jetzt nicht so vom Hocker, da wir trotz Wufcstengegend schlechtes und kaltes Wetter hatten?!nnn Fufcr alle anderen wenn man am Stripe ist, kann man sich auch die Show anschauen. Aber erwartet nichts, was euch ein Leben lang begleiten wird. Es ist halt doch nur ein paar Wasserfontuenen. Schicke... aber halt nur Wasser."
1,"Holy crap!  Weve eaten burgers all over the country.  Ive never had one as good as this.  I got the one with pepper jack cheese and jalapeufos cant remember name and it was juicy, extremely tasty, and irresistible. The female in our picture got the blue cheese burger and, believe it or not, it was better than mine.  We also got some blue cheese and bacon mac and cheese that was very, very good.  When I get a hamburger craving, Im coming here.nnThere was a mix of people... bikers, college kids, old people, and goodlooking ones like us."
1,"My BFF had her wedding reception here because of the outdoor dining, great prices and reputation and this place didnt fail to deliver. Loved the great  original selections of pescalactoovo menu items. Only complaint was the overrpriced margs but thats Vegas for ya! Would def go again."
1,"Asian buffets are a guilty pleasure of mine. Cheap, pretty tasty and all you can eat. It cant get much better than that. This place gets pretty busy and they still maintain pretty good service and keep the food stations clean."
1,"I highly recommend this dealership. Steve Shannon is a pro. Knowledgeable, patient, with not an ounce of pushiness. I am extremely happy with my new , gorgeous Cadillac XTS . Steve is one in a million. Many thanks to him and Toby in finance. They rocked it."
1,"weve been jonesin for hawaiian food since we got back from maui last month.  new restaurant in town and a coupon and a friday night means a night out.  the place was empty or emptying out which is never a good sign and theres a wait for your food because they cook it fresh!  it was very good.  good portions and it hit the spot.  we were very happy.  nnnow, heres some constructive criticism they need a little more hawaiian flavor there maybe music or surf videos or even beach smelling candles.  hey, maybe they can pull off tiki torches in the parking lot!  nnnow heres my shout out.  WHY is this place empty on a friday night?  i hate seeing good places going unappreciated.  this location is at the corner of thousands of homes and besides mcdonalds and dunkin donuts and a few hole in the wall joints, theres not much dining selection in the area.  i know times are tough, but plenty of you are shelling out money to go get the same old junk food.  you people of pecan creek and taylor ranch and wayne ranch and castlegate and encanterra need to support your local businesses and its good for you!  if this place sucked i wouldnt be saying this, so just remember, if this place goes out of business and you never get a chance to eat there, then youre missing out."
1,"Since my daughters favorite food is sushi, this place has become a regular place for us. Weve been coming here for a couple years now and love it. The staff is nice, and the food is good! The specials are almost always a welcome surprise! nWe can always count on getting a quick bite no matter what time."
1,"Joel came and cleaned our carpets yesterday, and we couldnt be happier.  He was professional and polite, the price was good, and our carpets look great!  They were also dry in just a couple of hours, and with several small children, that was a huge plus!  We will definitely use Riggs Services again."
1,"After waiting way too long to be initially acknowledged and dying for drinks, I wasnt sure how I could be soothed, but...WOW. Unbelievable food. I mean better than Ive had in years. The ambience was sexy, yet casual. The quinoa is beyond expectations and the kale flatbread was also perfect. It was ALL a ten! Excellent!!!!"
1,"This is definitely my kind of hotel modern, hip, great service, great bars and restaurants, and architecturally sexy. nnIts the little details that make this place awesome. Especially their location in the heart of old town."
1,"My wife ate here growing up and when we came back to Arizona for our anniversary vacation she said we absolutely had to come here for our special dinner. It did not disappoint!!!!! We had the delicious spinach artichoke dip for our appetizer, we both had the salad with the Roquefort dressingmade fresh in house  the filet mignon as our entree with grilled vegetables and chipotle Mac n cheese! The steak was super moist with just the right amount of seasoning and charred to perfection. Great food, great service I will definitely be back again!!!! nnP.S Our waitress Tiania H was very knowledgable and attentive! Thanks for being awesome!"
1,This place was a secret little hideaway. There were statues. Inside there were oversized chairs around the fireplace. There were a couple hidden rooms. The balcony provided a nice view. There was a bar. Very quiet and subtle and fun.
1,I love it down there!  Especially on a pretty night.  This is a good place to go whether its day or night.  Even in the winter it is very pretty when it snows.  They hang white lights on everything and it is very pretty.  There is truly something for everyone!  Restaurants range from Eat NPark to fine dining.  The Lowes theater is very impressive.  They even have an IMAX inside!  There are lots of shops to visit and everything is within walking distance of each other.  There are also comedy clubs and bars to visit in the evening.  The whole area is kept very clean and due to the way they have the whole area situated you dont even feel like you are in the city.  You cant even hear the highway traffic!
1,"I was in Vegas with my wife last weekend and heard about this must go, best in country Thai restaurant. I will say that our first impression of this place was not good at all. Its not the unassuming building or the location. Its the buffet lunch that they put out there. DONT try the buffet lunch. Again, DONT get the buffet lunch. Its terrible. We were there around  on a Friday and  the steam table trays were half empty. They also took their time replenishing the food, which was slightly better than mediocre, which is not saying much. Service for the buffet was also terrible. Seems like the wait and kitchen staff were more intent on taking care of the menu customers than the buffet customers. I dont understand why restaurants do this. If you are going to offer a buffet, at least keep it hot and full at all times even if the food is not good. If we didnt know about this place, the buffet experience would have turn us off completely and we would never come back. I am tempted to give this place a  star except that the food off the menu was so much better and a better representation of this place.nnWe came back again with great trepidation to try out the menu. Our buffet experience was so bad that we almost didnt come back. We were glad to give them one more chance. They have a great menu and offered northern dishes that we dont see a lot. Food came out quickly and the wait staff was always attentive unlike the Buffet. Garlic Prawns were fantastic as were the sour rice salad, Khao Soi and the other dishes that we ordered. Their food certainly had more depth to it than what you would find at a typical place.nnUltimately, was this the best Thai restaurant in the nation, probably not. The lunch buffet was a waste of time and money. It shouldnt even be offered for a restaurant like this, where the menu is the gem. However, the menu item were certain unique and good enough that we will come back next time we are in town. for the menu items, NOT the buffet."
1,"True Food indeed! The mixed reviews are telling so I am going to rate this purely from my experience last night. I started out with the hamachi and pomegranate sashimi. Wow, the combination was mouth watering after I ate my first piece. Who would have thought pomegranate with hamachi? nnI ordered the curry and rice noodles with the shrimp. The dish involved more than just that of which it had perfectly cooked vegetables that brought out the flavor. I was pleasantly satisfied with the texture of the crispy vegetables and the soft rice noodles with a hit of curry. It was one of those dishes where in the beginning you question I cant really taste anything but then you take a couple more bites and it comes together. You start understanding why the combination of the celery, chards, cilantro with this type of curry and . . . okay I am just going to stop. Its one dish and it did it for me. We also ordered the caramelized onion tart with Gorgonzola and figs. I was not impressed and would recommend trying a different appetizer because there were many appetizers that sounded delicious . nnThey also offered all these creative healthy juices, which I want to try next time. Overall, we had a great dining experience. Our waitress seemed to be very knowledgeable about the menu and was very helpful in making our choices. This is obvious but I have to give True Food credit for creating yummy dishes using mostly organic, flax, and gluten free. The decor was very open, airy, and Frank Lloyd Wrightish."
1,"We were told to visit this mall because it was a sight to see. It was a very pretty mall. It is  stories of stores, but very short distance from one end to the other. This makes it easy to have many stories. They have a wide variety of shops and a little bit of everything for everyone. Not as much focused on food as other malls are though. Worth going to see for the sights."
1,"Ive been going to Sushi Ko since . Nothing has changed in over  years and thats a good thing, since the food and service has always been excellent. This place first and foremost serves traditional Japanese sushi and it does a GREAT job. If youre looking for Asian Fusion sushi with weird and funky things in it and doofdoof music blaring, while bartenders shake up  cocktails, dont even think about Sushi Ko. nOh and Ive taken Japanese exchange students to Sushi Ko before.  They raved about it and couldnt believe the how awesome the quality and authenticity was."
1,Stopped by here for lunch during our Montreal trip. It wasnt too busy on a Tuesday afternoon thankfully so we got our food quickly and found some open seats. Their seating is limited but there is a park nearby so that wouldnt have been a bad idea to take it to go and eat there. We got the half chicken which came with so much fries. The chicken was seasoned so well and the sauce is very good. I thought the half chicken was more than enough to share between two people.
1,Was welcomed on coming inside the front door. Shown how to use the tablet to order and to customize our order. I went with the breakfast steak bowl with rice amazing. I was only able to finish half. My other half went with a BIT wrap and took out half the stuff. Hes not a health nut but was satisfied. I will be returning!
1,"Great place super cool staff, on the whole Filipina waitress was wonderful went with friends last week on a tip while visiting LV and were delighted with nigiri, sashimi and composed dishes, alike.  The uni fresh from Channel Islands, off Santa Barbara on scallops dish was a particularly great take on a Japanese original.  Service was strong, overall, with one episode of soy sauce spilling on a diners jeans from an overeager, but, sweet, manager.  Two suggestions  Please make sure the hojicha or genmaicha is served in a warmed mug and nearly piping at degF ours was lukewarm and, please consider offering a lighter, more tradional dessert.nnNoto bene to Roman, Franklin, Marissa and other Yelp haters  others who will never get a place like Yonaka  there is a Chinese megabuffet with mountains of cheap sushi near you where you can be as loud and tacky as you like, and, where you can fill up your gut with nonsustainable fish thats likely mismarked, e.g. what you think has been hamachi all this time has actually been something else bait fish, rejected by fishermen, washed in bleach.  You can actually then pass out in the booth at said same establishment once youve had your fill, awaken a few hours later and then hit the buffet, again!!  Such a deal!! They also have unlimited fortune cookies!!  And, vanilla pudding!!  Oooooh, youre such celebrities!!nnOh, and, oenophiles, spare us ALL, please, your whineeee complaints about corkage fees, etc  it is so Junior Varsity to order red with sushi, in the first place it is even more JV to actually bring a big red or, buttery chard with you from your private stash.  In the best Japanese restaurants think Jirosans Michelin star, Sukiyabashi in Ginza, the progression is sake and beer with early courses, progressing to hojicha with later, then, fresh matcha whisked up to accompany sweet course and, not much of that, to finish.  Save that amazing, leggy cab that you simply cannot live without and must carry around in its own, special wine carrier for your philistine buddies and those cornfed, USDA Prime, oz, steroidladen Tbones at the country club where you, as the great Bacchus, god of wine, can lord over lesser beings with your phenomenal ability to actually drink . bottles of wine in public with a straight and, way too serious face...  nnAnd, gentle eaters, kindly stop rubbing your chopsticks together, making soy saucewasabi emulsions, and, dipping the rice portion of the nigiri into the soy sauce, will ya?!nnYonaka works on so many levels, but, it works best for the more experienced, subtle diner whos actually spent time in bigger markets especially Japan and who can appreciate just how good this place really is.  There is a fine, welledited selection of beers, etc., along with really good sakes its World Sake Month, so, good specials, now, and, thoughtfully selected wines, etc., so, appreciate the staff and ask for pairing recommendations.  The measure you give is the measure you receive...  nnAt  .person for sharing the abundant  course omakase wdrinks, we kept wondering where the rest of the check was.  This is one of the great deals out there, folks."
1,"We normally stay at the MGM Signature but got comped a  night stay and I am truly surprised at how nice our stay was. Check in was quick and easy and even though the casino is older, they do a good job of keeping it clean and filtering the air so that the cigarette smell isnt overwhelming.nnThey have redone the rooms and usually this type of room would be an upgrade at different Vegas hotels.  We were on the second floor and didnt have the best view but our room was large, clean, and had a modern, upscale look. The bed was comfortable and had overhead reading lights and the AC worked well and was very quiet.  The flat screen had lots of channels but no HBO.  The bathroom had high end touches and the lighted, magnifying mirror was a nice touch and I also used it as a night light.  What I didnt care for was that the bathroom was very small and the shower pressure was incredibly powerful and almost hurt.  I liked that the closet was spacious and there was a safe.  We never heard anything from other rooms but people were really loud in the hallway even late into the night. There is a fridge in the room but it is stocked with alcohol and snacks.  If you remove any of it youll automatically be charged for it and the prices are so unreasonable that its better to go to the first floor shop for drinks and snacks.  nnThe location is right in the center of the strip.  To one side you are steps away from the Forum shops of Caesars Palace which houses more high fashion designers under one roof than anywhere in the world.  In the other direction you are close to Treasure Island and the Palazzo.  Its easy to walk to all the places.  MGM, Luxor, Excalibur are on the other end of the strip and you may want to take the monorail but thats easy to get to.  From the Mirage, just cross the street and the monorail is located inside of Harrahs.nnThe Mirage has a really great buffet with tons of food options.  We ordered room service one night and the food arrived at the promised time,  minutes, and our pizzas were very good.  There are no upscale shopping choices in the Mirage but thats okay because the Forum Shops are next door!  The pool was large with lots of chairs and youll need your room key to get in.  We had a great stay and will definitely be back."
1,"Ill keep it simple. You are missing out if you dont try this place. It has the best Indian food with amazing service. nnAll I can say is the next time you want to grab food, come here and you will leave happy and stuffed.nnWe cannot wait to go back!"
1,Caught Primus and Gogol Bordello there. Awesome venue! Perfect size and an interesting layout. In between bands we grabbed a booth in the restaurant section. Quick and painless with very attentive service. Devoured a plate of Rock N Roll fries. Delicious! Drinks were priced well for being on the strip but the only negative would be an underwhelming beer selection. Easy to get in and out of the venue with multiple options for parking. Excited for Janes Addiction and Fishbone next weekend!
1,"Were moving up in the gastroworld! We finally have a boutique bakery!!nnTiffanys meets croissants and cupcakes. It would almost be too cute to handle but their pastries are rad, I have confidence that they know what theyre doing with bread which they arent selling yet, but soon, soon and they do egg and cheese in the morning. For cheap.nnPetit Fours would make the most sense, but they also do Fake fig newtons, pop tarts, oreos, that fancy Nabisco thing thats hit bigger towns so hard. The sipsized coffee is nice  sometimes you just want a half cup, ya?nnUnfortunately, this is where they fail a bit. Ive had scorched, Ive had too thin  I have not had a cup that rivaled Julias, Central, or even Smelly Cat. Sadface. Hopefully this will improve  at close to  bucks, you need to show your brew some TLC and appease us snobs.nnDecor is airy, clean, modern, lovely, kind of vast for a bakery, and being able to peep into the back kitchens an awesome touch. Sweetness."
1,"Ive been to this location over  times.  A very good small neighborhood Chinese Restaurant.  Well over a hundred menu options.  Friendly staff, good food, best price.  If you want more options, bigger, fancier, and perhaps the best tasting, go to Benihanas.  This is usually a  or  star experience."
1,"Went here for dinner saturday night with a party of five. We called ahead an got on the wait list they dont do reservations, but you can call ahead and be put on the wait list up to  mins before you arrive we were seated within mins of arriving. We were promptly greeted by the server. Drinks and appetizers also came out quickly. Dinner followed as expected. Service was great, food was also good, everyone was completely satisfied.nnOne item to point out  I had the rib eye, it was cooked fine and completely ok for me,  but they do use a generous amount of seasoning salt, next time I will ask for light seasoning."
1,"I tried this place about a month ago, and have been back at least  times since. So glad to finally find a Chinese food place near my house that I love. When I call in an order for pickup, the food is ready within  minutes and reasonably priced. nnIve never eaten inside the restaurant myself, but it seems nice. There are always a couple waitresses busy keeping the customers happy. Its a small interior, with about  booths and  tables which could be pushed together to accommodate a larger group. nnGreat wall is in the small stripmall just South of Walgreens which is at Williams Field Rd. Also in the stripmall is Sherwin Williams and Little Caesers"
1,so the first step is admitting you have a problem right? I admit I drive by places that are right by my house and then I try them eventually and find out i have been missing out on spectacular food all along. shaking finger at selfnnPHO HOW I LOVE THEE !!!!ngo here.nget pho.nlove it.ngo backnand nrepeatnseveral timesna week.nI do.
1,"I agree completely with the previous reviewer.  This place is not too far to drive and service is always quite fast.  I went to a different place today but was unable to find where they advertised it to be.nnThen, I knew I should have just done what Ive done for a few years.  I headed to Fort Apache, drove right in, and was on my way in about  minutes.nnThe registration process is done."
1,"Yes, please.nnI was in SDale on business and needed to grab a quick lunch. I ducked in to Sandwich Club or is it Sandwichclub? Expecting your usual fast food type sub. No way! This place has character, with a menu to match. A little quirky, as the young man that greeted me seemed to have no other job  but he was very entertaining and nice to chat with. One of the regulars convinced me to have a seat and chat with him, and Im glad I did. We had a great conversation, and his buddy shared some goofy jokes. Sometimes chatting with people you dont know makes your life better.nnI recommend the sandwich named after the gal behind the counter. Its the first one on the menu with brie and peppers in the ingredients. I was a little hesitant at first, but my inner order the special voice got the better of  me. Im glad it did, as it was wonderful! nnIf I give you my address, can you FedEx me a sandwich?"
1,"Play here at least twice a month. Always a pleasure.  Jessica the cart girl is our out and out favorite . nDriving range is grass , way better than playing off the matts. nThe course is well designed and challanging but not to much. The golf pros are enthusiastic. Id go  out of five but you can find better however for the  of  a round during summer hours its True Value ."
1,"Ive heard Sapphire referred to as The Costco of the strip club world. This made me profoundly curious  ponderous, even.  Are there hefty patrons standing idly, blocking entire isles, dumbfound by overwhelming selection? Would I feel like a soulless consumer after  minutes of browsing? Would a bulk quantities approach precipitate reinforced dancing poles and spotters for lap dances? Where would the name tags go? These were questions that tugged at my very core.  nnSo, my lovely coresearcherlove of my lifeseriously naughty temptress A and I packed up the car and headed east to WheretheHELLismymoneytopia. nnAhhh, Vegas. The place that loves to pretend it is a little naughtier than it actually is. Sure there is a multitude of ways to go brokeend up in jailcontract new and interesting diseases, but you really have to look sometimes. In this, Sapphire stands out. Its is huge.  You cant miss it.  Mr. Magoo could find this place half drunk with a bucket on his head. nnWe entered a nicely decorated for a strip club lobby and were greeted by some of the largest, nicest thank you, sir men I have ever seen. n Nice greeters just like at Costco? Check. nFrom there, A and I were directed to the cash register. n Cash registers? Check. Having to pay money to enter membership fee? Check. nnOK, so at this rate, this review is going to be too long and extra special annoying. Lets just drop the Costco jokes. nnI wouldnt say Sapphire is the Costco of the strip club world, but rather the Willy Wonkas Chocolate Factory of strip clubs. It feels like it never ends, you tend to lose sight of reality and there is enough eye candy to make choosing almost impossible. A strip club in a building this big MUST have been built by some poor guy compensating for something Its his little penis. Hes compensating for his teenyweeny weeny. nnFor your floor show enjoyment, Sapphire is equipped with three semiconnected stages that no one really seems to pay much attention to. The room is so large and full, that just getting to and from a stage to tip a dancer would require a ration of water and a compass. The poles arent even attached to anything. Well, they attach to the floor I think stripper technology is still a few years away from the levitating poles, but they only go up  feet  the ceiling is at least . So no pole dancing, but tether ball possibilities GALORE! The poor girls rotate between stages as the songs change from the first micro stage up to the next, totally inaccessible stage that is so high the temptation to spit off of it must be overwhelming for the dancers, back to another comically tiny stage.  All this real estate inside and they have these poor girls dancing on coffee tables.  Let them be free.  Let them run and play and gyrate as God intended!  Free Range Strippers I say!nnThis all sounds bad, right? NO! It is very, very good  just hear me out. There are TONS of girls there slithering a sexy slither, not a creepy, weasely wanna buy a watch slither between the floor seats. They were everywhere. The girls on stage are there because you have to have girls on stage.  But, the real show is happening inclose to your lap fees and restrictions may apply. The view was great, especially when someones butt was blocking it. nSapphire was crowded but I swear there was still a girl for every  customers and not an ugly one in the bunch.  Each entertainer was at least cute and all of them had bodies that can only come from copious amounts of time doing things that require a sports bra. Then there are the servers ours was very nice, cute, and as quick as she could be considering having to cover distances that would make Lance Armstrong wince.   And we cant forget the shot girls nasty shots, nice girls pushing vial drinks see, thats funny because they come in a vial, but they are also vile.  Its funny, damn it.  You just wait.  Youll snicker when you see them.. nnSapphire is expensive, especially if you become smitten as we did. Especially if your girlfriend falls in love, as mine did. It is doubly so if you strongly encourage the ladies to enjoy each others company, as I could not help but do.  Ask for the tour before you pick what you want. Our lovely assistant was very helpful and talked us out of several more expensive options in favor of one that would provide the three of us with the most time and ... freedom.  nnDid I spend the equivalent of a full months rent that night? Yes I did. Do I regret it? Not on your life. Im saving up to do it again as I write this. We knew we were going to go all out. We had been planning Operation Naughty Bits for months.  I will say if we had shown up only planning to spend , we would have not had much fun.  Expensive, but worth every penny!"
1,"I cannot go to Vegas and not have Earl of Sandwich atleast once.. this place is DAMN GOOD!!!!  I dont know what it is, but their sandwiches are fresh, hot and made to order as you like it.. from the first bite you will be in heaven!nnToasted panini sandwiches to die for at a reasonable .... BLT was bomb and so was the Tuna Melt!!! ANDDDD they are open  inside Planet Hollywood. Perfect place to hit up after the barclub!!nnOnly thing Im mad about is that they dont have any locations closer to me in California!"
1,"Of all of the GameStops in the Phoenix Metro area, this is the best to go to. I have been going to this one since the day I bought my house down the road and I would go out of my way to keep shopping here.nnI have a great rapport with Dean, Jason, Kevin, and Todd who do an outstanding job of providing knowledgable information about games and are not afraid to share their opinions on a particular game. If I come in not knowing what I am looking for, the staff are great at finding out what I like to play and recommending an appropriate title I might like.nnIf you want to go to a place where youll get canned responses and foolishly unhelpful staff, go buy from Wal Mart or Best Buy, in many cases you will end up spending more of your money at those places. But if you want honest prices and excellent staff, hit up this GameStop, they are the best."
1,Dont let the unassuming exterior fool you. The food is excellent. The wine selection is superb. The service is outstanding. The owner went out of is way to accommodate our large party  at the last minute. An excellent experience all around. And go on Saturday for the mammas gravy special. Truly authentic Italian.
1,"Short but sweet. nnBring your mac. Ambience is perfect for doing work or facebooking for hours. Yes, its now a verb.nnBlueberry chicken salad. Its the only entree Ive ever tried because it is so darn tasty. I swap the chips for a salad and throw it on the sammy to feel better about life and the two chocolate chip cookies proceeding the bcs. nnWhy not  stars? Where the customer service is terrific the nice man taking orders must also taste test for coffee quality control for as much enthusiasm and zeal pouring out of this guy a to go order takes longer than a bike ride around Lake Mendota, regardless of how busy or slow. Call it in, yelpers, and enjoy."
1,"Everything about this restaurant is perfect. The waitress serving us described Becketts table food as being upscale comfort food which I think captures the essence of this place.nnExtensive wine list, cool decor, interesting and original menu, reasonable prices for fresh, quality food.nnLets stop pretending I care about my health. This is what I ordered the andouille sausage with grits BEST GRITS I HAVE EVER HAD BY FAR. WOW!!, and a side of mashed potatoes. We were a table of six, so we kind of ordered from the whole menu. Other things that were in and around my mouth the FANTASTICCCCCCCCCC mac and chesse, the meatballs, and the cheese board. nnWe also got an amazing bottle of pinot grigio whose name escapes me probably cause I had about the  glasses and Im a cheap drunk.nnTo summarize if you like alcohol, have a hearty appetite, and like to eat things that taste good but are bad for you, come to Becketts table!"
1,"Went to see the lake of course, but decided to stop at the restaurant. Great location, reasonable prices, very friendly service, generous portions ...not at all the settings of a tourist trap. I am local and I  think we ll go back for dinner at sunset  !"
1,"The exact reason why some people dont like this place is precisely why I love it.   They put fries and coleslaw on your sandwich.  Awesome.   They serve everything with cheese.  They have really good beer choices, including their house dark which isnt bad for  a pint, which is ridiculous.  nnPittsburgh is not a healthy town.  The salad craze hasnt made its way here.  And therefore I love it.  Give me a big ass tasty sandwich, with good, cheap beer and you have made me a happy man.  I loved this place.  Id totally come back when Im in town next."
1,"I have been going to fleet feet for about a year now and have received more than just quality products. nFleet feet offers trainings and a community of runners that support your goals. They restored my love for running and all of the staff are runners themselves. They are honest about what gear they like best and you cannot get a better shoe fitting. I have never felt pressured to buy anything. Whether you have been running for years or want to start, fleet feet will make you more confident in your run. Run happy!"
1,"We try to eat here every time we are in Vegas  its that good!  Ive been happy with all my meals here, the latest being a gaucho steak salad, which is a whole bunch of steak strips served on half a head of lettuce with onions and a fabulous dressing, as well as an interesting vegetable that looked like a cross between asparagus and broccoli.  It was all very tasty.  My dh had the chef make a shrimp diablo fajita that he really enjoyed.  Prices are good, service is great, food excellent!"
1,"No  this is not a review of the pasties that women wear to cover up nipples underneath their clothing or instead of bathing suit tops... this is a review for Cornish pasties... and to be honest, I didnt know what they were either, until I read the  reviews that came before mine!nnSo, I finally made my way to Cornish Pasty Company today after months and months of seeing the reviews roll in, and now I know why there are so many CP fans.  This place is great!nnIts kind of a British pub atmosphere inside. Really laid back and comfortable  and mostly men dining... my party balanced it out as the three of us brought some estrogen inside!  The menu consists of a diverse variety of pasties, which are like calzones or English hot pockets.  They are all homemade with fresh ingredients, and many of them sound super yummy i had a hard time deciding what to order... nnI went with the chicken greek pasty while my dining companions went with the carne adovada and the spicy asiago chicken.  I think we were all pretty happy with our respective orders.  I noticed they have large salads on the menu also.  Im thinking perhaps next visit Ill try a salad  maybe even go with someone who has similar tastes to me and split a pasty and a salad?  Any takers?nnEither way, Ill be back  it may have been my first Cornish Pasty experience but it will not be my last!"
1,"I went here alone while my husband played in a poker tournament. I got a nice little table in their patio thing that is right next to the slot machines in the casino so I could people watch. nnI started off with the baked Brie. It was so good. Loved the cherries giving it a nice sweetness. It comes with little sliced baguettes. For dinner I got the shepherds pie.  It comes out in a little bucket which was awesome. This was so so tasty. nI walked a ways to get here after reading the yelp reviews, so I was very happy that the prior positive reviews were right. The staff was super friendly as well. I would definitely recommend this place."
1,"We eat at a lot of different restaurants, of all flavors. This is a great little restaurant for families and folks looking for great service at a great price. All we needed to do was to ask for a change and abracadabra, it was done.nnThis is not a place to take your rich relatives, or especially those that are wannabes, but for a good Chinese meal where your kids are OK, this is a great choice."
1,"I liked the concept of Leos Beanery before I even arrived there. This was for several reasons.nnLeos Beanery is a newish cafe in the New Town, and this is an exciting event. I dont know how many times my finger has frozen due to a complete lack of inspiration when I get a text from someone, asking where we should meet for coffee. Ok, fine, there are a multitude of places round Edinburgh to drink a half decent coffee, but I always try to keep it varied, so that Im not sitting jaded and glassyeyed one day in a coffee shop I used to love, but went to far too much.nnAlso, prior to making my way over to this new and exciting cafe option, I read online that I could expect coffee, tea and coterie. Coterie...coterie? Dont mess with my head here Leos Beanery. A group of people with shared interests and banter? Do you mean that when I get there, therell be other people that used to collect stamps, and who incessantly listen to old school dance, and who circle sentences in magazines that they like the look of? if this is the case, then I fully embrace this coterie business.nnThe day I chose to go was a busy Saturday afternoon. I have no issue with busy places if youre meeting friends, and its almost always a good sign if somewhere is packed to the rafters anyway, but if I was coming along on my own, I would choose a different day. I dont mind sipping away on an Americano and working when other people are around, but it would be nice to experience this place again in its chilled out form.nnMy friends and I sat at a table through the back, near a bookshelf, so if you do get stood up, this is a good place to sit, because it means you can swiftly grab a book and leaf through it casually, hopefully concealing the fact you didnt mean to come in on your own. There is also a pretty awesome sewing machine as part of a table combination going on. I want that table the next time.nnThe cafe has that comfortable, lived in look to it, and has definitely gone down the vintage route, which I like, as Im always a bit suspicious of anywhere too gleaming. For some absurd reason, I wasnt hungry enough to eat anything from the savoury menu, but I will be back to attend to this. There were plenty of sweet choices to select from, so I went for a tasty and lightly sponged lemon cake number, teamed with a sturdy latte. Both good, both worth returning for.nnOh, and theres free WiFi. This instantly reinforces the four stars."
1,"A crucial factor in my decision to live at the MGM Signature is the Las Vegas monorail. I use the monorail daily. It gets me up and down the strip in no time.nnThe monorail is consistently clean, well maintained, and on schedule. The customer service employees and security personnel are friendly, competent, and helpful. Still though, there are some important operational problems that need to be resolved before the monorail can hope to gain mainstream acceptance from locals.nnAsk any Las Vegas resident that lives on or near the strip why they dont use the monorail. The answer will always be the same Purchasing tickets is a major hassle. nnThe  locals only ticket can only be purchased by interacting with a customer service representative, not from one of the automated machines. This isnt ideal. Sometimes the tickets simply cant be purchased because the line is too long. Other times theres no line, but the ticket agent is busy helping tourists with navigational questions. Sometimes the computer isnt working. Other times the computer is working but theyre out of tickets. Sometimes there are plenty of tickets but the dispenser is jammed or just doesnt work properly. Furthermore, each purchase requires an ID check and manual data entry, and to make matters worse, only two tickets i.e. rides can be purchased at a time. This is a significant drawback because as a local, its often necessary to make more than two rides per day.nnLately Ive found myself reverting back to more traditional modes of transportation e.g. cabs in order to avoid the uncertainty, hassle, and purchase restrictions inherent in the monorails ticketing process. The frustrating thing is, most of these operational problems could be resolved quite easily.nnThe obvious question is Why are regular riders forced to use paper tickets at all? This is . All modern, efficient transportation systems allow users to purchase an electronic card that can be swiped at the entry gates. The charge for each ride is automatically billed to a creditdebit card. Scalping is eliminated by disallowing multiple entries at the same gate from a single account holder within any given twenty minute period. nnThe bottom line here is that by forcing locals to engage in a needless, errorprone interaction with a human customer service agent each and every day, the Monorail is virtually guaranteeing that locals will rarely use the service, and those that do like me will use it a lot less frequently than they otherwise would."
1,"I have been going to the location on Scottsdale Road, and the staff has been incredible. Dr Dean is my pcp, and he is very knowledgeable, and was able to correctly identify my issue that most other people were failing to recognize. It was a fast, professional, and pain free experience, and for that Im very grateful."
1,"I cant speak much on their overall security services, but the customer service Ive experienced here has been great so far. Weve been meaning to copy a key at a locksmith Home Depot cant do this particular key, when lo and behold, as we were pulling out of Orchid Gardens on the way to Meadows Mall, we see the locksmith sign. I cant remember the name of the gentleman who helped us, but he copied our key swiftly and for a relatively cheap price. We also inquired about changing the locks of our home and he broke down pricing, possible lock options, and provided us the phone  of the people who handle the planning of the services. He didnt make us feel stupid for asking very basic questions about locks. There were also plenty of other people in the store looking at their large safes. Looks like folks in Vegas have a lot of stuff to lock up"
1,"Review on specialty rolls, not nigirinnCame here twice in the last month so I guess its review time! Both times Ive recently come Ive been lucky and never really had to wait for a table but by the time Im done, its filled up and theres a bit of a wait so I would definitely call ahead for larger parties.

Also, this location is really pretty on the inside, definitely a good choice for date night."
1,"Having just dropped off my better half at Altered Ego an opportunity was presented to try US Egg for breakfast. Sitting here now after having the California Benedict. Its  and the place is pretty busy. Plenty of booths and tables with an outdoor patio. The restaurant is clean, service was fast and friendly. My food was tasty and filling. I would not hesitate to return."
1,"Ask for Ely! Excellent Aveda salon and, Ely truly embodies all that is good about Aveda. I have been going regularly to Aveda salons for the last  months, first in SF now here in Scottsdale. And switching from Brunette to blonde requires a lot of color. Aveda color is the only color that does not damage my hair. Ely does an expert balyage application and is careful to mind the condition of my hair. And my hair is looking fabulous and more healthy each visit due to the conditioning treatments and the TLC from Ely! Thanks for being my day maker!"
1,"I liked this place a lot and visited quite a few times during my recent stay. The bartenders were friendly and knew quite a bit about the variety of beers they had on tap. Happy to let you sample anything youd like. The waitresses were attentive and friendly as well. The menu has just about everything you need, from somewhat daring to basic. All cooked very well.  nnThis pub is situated in a nice spot between the two bustling hotels and offers a nice, quiet respite from the crowded scenes. It can get busy in the evenings, so hit it during the lunchtime hours to relaz and unwind."
1,"I had to review this place right away because it truly is THAT good! I was able to sample their cookies Boozy Chocolate Chip Cookie at a Yelp event and couldnt help but buy their products afterwards. The Drunken Oatmeal Cookie Sandwich is out of this world. Even if you are not an oatmeal person, I still think that you would enjoy this cookie sandwich! That is how amazing it is! The alcohol in it is not too dominant, but makes the product very unique. I also ate the Hop In Lime cupcake, which was very good. The icing is wonderful and the filling inside of the cake was just delicious. It did not have an overly dominant lime taste, so I would recommend this to those of you who are not as adventurous with your taste buds! I cannot wait to introduce my family and friends to this place!!!"
1,A perfect place for a lazy Sunday morning breakfast! I had the Chefs special which was an asparagus and swiss omelet with a red pepper cream sauce. To die for yummy! The little biscuits and homefries served with it were delicious too! nnMy boyfriend had the chicken enchilada and loved it. nnOur only criticism would be for the drinks. He had a Bloody Mary. The drinks were premade so they could not customize. He said there was too much pepper and not enough Worcestershire. nnThey dont serve any pop either. Pop is my caffeine fix of choice so that was a bit of a bummer. nnService was good and it was fun to walk around the property while we waited for our table.
1,"I have never been disappointed with Americas Taco Shop. I love this place... nnThe vegetarian quesadilla, beans, guacamole and salsa are all staples for me. And I just LOVE that they have lardfree refried beans...  At most places,  if you want vegetarian, you have to get whole beans or black beans... nnThe cochata half coffee, half horchata is seriously amazing.... They also have one of the best margaritas Ive had in quite a while, which was surprising to me... Even better that its lowcal and on tap. nnI guess the only thing that would make this  stars is if it were slightly cheaper... but whatever, Im always willing to pay for good food!"
1,"Love this place!nThis place is super cute  service was stellar.

So fresh and yummy!nnPros Atmosphereloved the quirky decorations and laid back feel, food, drinks, service, purse hooks under the bar nnCons Bloody Mary, creepy art upstairs...sorry but that was Creepsville USA up there. Im all for the art gallery upstairs, just not a bunch of deathexecution scenes right before I eat my breakfast. yikes."
1,"I really do love coming here.nThey are attentive and the customer service is spectacular.nThe language barrier seems difficult but I promise you, if you give the employees of this family run business time, they will answer all your questions and treat you exceptionally well.nLike any nail salon, do your research! Know what is on the market and what you want before you arrive IE, types of gel and acrylics. This helps greatly. nnGet the callus remover. Its . more and worth every penny. Tell them which areas you want them to focus on too! Calves, heels, cuticles, etc!nnOnly downfall IMO? Poor reading material... but then again, most of us have modern technology and social networking to keep us distracted!"
1,"We dined here last weekend whilst staying at the Wynn.nWe went for lunch one day and brunch another day.nThe first day my husband had the burger and I had the spinach chicken wrap, both were amazing, and we shared a side of parmesan truffle fries  the name says it all  they were so so good.nBrunch  I had chicken and waffles and my husband had the salad, this time we sat out on the terrace by the pool as the weather was amazing, both meals were amazing again. nThe staff here were super friendly and helpful on both occasions, the second time it was really busy but our food came out in a timely manner and our drinks were always kept topped up or else this would have been an automatic  star removal review!nI really wanted to try the banana split something I havent had since a kid, but each time I was too full  I guess that means I will have to go back there again"
1,"This is a fabulous restaurant, very casual and it gets busy at lunch time but the food is amazing. I highly recommend this place for something a little different, I have been going here for more than  years!"
1,"I was drawn to this place while looking for BFG chicken strips and I saw big red letters that read BOOKS.  Since earlier I was thinking of stopping into Barnes  Nobles to check out some new books, I thought, why not give this place a shot.  Walking in, I felt like I was in a psychic shop filled with books.  Everything seemed so fragile and carefully organized.  Sections were labeled at the top of the shelf by categories. There was a section of extremely old books which I felt compelled to look at but didnt pick any up.  I saw a section of vintage National Geographic magazines, which I have become a collector of, but I didnt catch the prices they were selling them for but Ill have to definitely come back to check them out. nI just came in for a slight browse, but, instead was sucked into buying a meditation book that kept me in the store for  minutes, just breezing through the first chapter.  I also found another great book that I had to get since it coordinated with a current book Ive been reading also.  nOverall, this place is a great place to find old books of wisdom, literature or anything of that matter.  They also have an area where they teach Spanish lessons located in the back and areas to sit if you want to skim through some books.  This place made my day really, and to top it off I went to BFG chicken strips only a few stores away from it and my day was complete with happy taste buds."
1,Great professional customer service ! Thanks Jeff for the quick adjustment on my TREK  and my new Giro helmet ! nThis shop is the top of my list for all other purchases !  ngreat place for Christmas gifts as well !  support Local First !  nric
1,"Great to have this option in Las Vegas.  A very authentic experience.  Had the Kabuto omakase set menu.  The nigiri was excellent.  This is the season for whitefish and they had a great variety of snapper from Southern Japan.  I didnt give it  stars as the grilled items were a let down.  In my visit there is a definite disconnect between the kitchen and sushi bar in terms of quality.  Upon my next visit, I may just double up on the nigiri set."

1,"Because I am the cheapskatiest of cheapskates, I love Groupon, but I have always been wary of buying Groupons for things like haircuts  theyre so personal, and when they go wrong, they can go SO VERY WRONG. nnBut, feeling particularly poor and without having established a favorite hair person here in Pittsburgh, I took a chance and bought a Groupon for Sergios.  I even made an appointment with someone totally unknown  no yelp reviews, no word of mouth approval, no bio on the website, no nothing!  Thats right yall I can be spontaneous.   Good thing I only had highlights  a trim planned...and lucky me, it was fantastic.nnYou can tell that the space has fairly recently transitioned from downhome barbershop to classy salon due to a change of ownership from father to son, apparently.  All of the staff seemed uniformly very young and very hip, but still friendly and accommodating.  The music was all s and s pop and alternative throwbacks that were such a delight.  And my mystery hairstylist was awesome  Dave not only gave me a really great cut and the most thorough highlighting of my life, but he also charmed my pants off  just a genuine, friendly, interesting fellow.nnI highly recommend this little gem  and if youve never been to Dormont, heres your chance! I hear theres karaoke at the Apple on Tuesdays..."
1,"Ive been to Sweet Melindas twice, and both times for special occasions. The first time, my flatmate and I pretended we were married and had continuously loud lovers tiffs. The second time was yesterday and it couldve easily been the subject of a  minute long sitcom.n nI graduated yesterday Yay! This is information you dont need, by the way so, my family decided to take me out to dinner with my flatmates family and my friends family. It was, in few words large loud Brazilian family meets Indian family meets Indian family from London. In small Scottish restaurant. The possibilities for disaster were infinite. Our whole table could have spontaneously combusted, for all I cared. But, everything went smoothly. My family were even effusive about the food. And we didnt even break glasses our knock people unconscious with empty wine bottles. nnSweet Melindas specialises in sea food, and they use mainly local organic produce. This bad vegetarian loves fish. So Sweet Melindas is heaven for me. A  course meal is set at the fixed price of .. As a starter I got squid, chilli, coriander and garlic salad. The main blew my head off, it was so good. It was also a learning experience. You might be more knowledgeable than I am, but I had no idea what samphire was. Now, I know people call it the asparagus of the sea. So, my main was steamed halibut with fresh crab and samphire. And oh my god. The halibut just melted in my mouth. It was buttery and lemony and all good things wrapped in a bite. nnOn my first excursion to Sweet Melindas we shared dessert and it was by far the best sticky toffee pudding Ive ever had in my life. It had dates and walnuts in it, you see. I think thats the secret ingredient. The second time, we were all fat and happy, so we decided not to push our luck.nnThe waiters were smiley and patient with us. And they knew what samphire was! I hear the red meat dishes were also very good, but Id say stick to the fish. They get it from a fishmongers next door called Eddies that specialises in local produce. nnSweet Melindas is kinda pricey but worth every single penny. Go on a special occasion, when youre feeling lavish."
1,"I love IKEA!  I love that you get decent quality items for a low cost.  I love that you can park your butt in the cafe and have a decent or sometimes really good meal for a little money.  I love the furniture and textiles offered.  I love the organizational items.  Heck, I just love every moment that I am there."
1,"I went here with big group of friends for brunch on a Sunday afternoon. The line was out the door, and we had to wait quite a while, but it was understandable since we had more than  people in our group.nnSo after about a  minute wait, we were finally seated. The service was pretty good. The waitress was really nice, and we didnt have to flag her down for water like at most restaurants in Montreal at least the restaurants I went to. nnAfter looking over the the menu, I decided to order the Lac SaintJean which is  eggs, bacon, baked beans, cretons, blueberry pancake, potatoes, toast, and fruit. The portion sizes are HUGE. I could barely finish all my food. The blueberry pancake was about the size of my face, and it was nice and fluffy. The eggs were ordered overeasy and they were cooked to perfection. The bacon was nice and crispy, and the fruit was really good as well.nnOverall, this place is a solid brunch place that will have your tummy doing a happy dance. Its better than your average brunch place. The presentation of the food is cool, and they make sure you leave full and happy. So check this place out when you have a chance."
1,"A year ago, when I was training for my first halfmarathon, the PF Changs one, this was my goto place. Yes, it helped that they live just a minute drive away from me, but everyone was really nice. I never got the sense that anyone was trying to talk me into spending more money. Part of that attitude probably has to do with the fact that they dont get paid for commission. But unlike a Foot Locker or some other mall store, the employees look like they actually run themselves. And they are incredibly patient. Im bummed that the brand of shoes that works best for me, they dont sell. But they still help me whenever I come in and I buy all my other things from them like socks, Gu, etc. nnThe people were pretty supportive in trying to give me advice last year when I had very bad shin splints and I wasnt there to buy anything. One salesman adjusted my shoes for me by putting the insoles of my old pair inside for extra cushioning. It seemed to do the trick. Its definitely a place where you are rarely steered wrong."
1,"If La Fonda Del Sol existed in New York City, there would be a line around the block waiting to get seats. The irony, of course, is that Arizonans consider this to be perfectly passable Mexican food, but a far cry from palatepleasing perfection. I suppose I find myself bitter knowing that such deliciousness could be viewed with such a blasue indifference by Phoenixs elite critics in New York, we still seek out the one true answer to the Mexican food problem, yet in Phoenix, the answer is so abundant it produces disenchantment.nnWell, friends, wed gladly take your La Fonda Del Sol. You get to keep the rest of those Mexican restaurants you love, so its only a minor loss. In exchange, you may have a Rosa Mexicana and a Dos Caminos. Nay, dont thank me.nnSo, La Fonda.... Truly spicy, homemade salsa perfectly crisp chile rellenos bathed in cheese, crusty chimichangas battered in love and ambrosia, huskwrapped tamales that taste homemade huge portions, incredibly low prices. This is what its all about.nnYeah, the tacky pastel Mexican decorations are unnerving and the service is slow and often panicked, but these are minor gripes.nnWhen its all said and done, these idiots forklift themselves into the waiting lines of NYPD Pizza HA! HAHAHA! and Oreganos BAHH! HAHA! while overlooking the real gem that sits in between them. Well, if youre a New Yorker like me, youre not gonna try either of those wrecks anyhow go get some Mexican."
1,"Got a massage and facial with Beth...she was professional and did a great job. The massage especially really relaxed me and worked out my knots. There is some noises here and there from hairdressers talking loud since it is located in a salon, but you are in a private room so its not too bad."
1,"Ive always lived somewhere with a Whole Foods.  Heck, even KANSAS has a Whole Foods, and Charlotte is FINALLY getting one in summer ? Yes, Whole Foods is Whole Paycheck, but its fantastic on all levels.  nnEarth Fare comes close...and youll only need partial paycheck, but its not quite at star status.  Let me eelabohrate. nnThe salad bar has some great options fruits and proteins and several kinds of lettuce. WF features way more dressings and crunchies like chia seeds and flax seeds to sprinkle on your greens. nnTIP  Sign up for their enewsletter. Youll get AWESOME deals, like  a pound chicken breast, or free Irish cheese with any  purchase. nnThe hot bar at EF is good and there are some fun specials, like old fashioned dinner nites when apple pie and sodas for cents.  Nice touch.  The dinners are always flavorful, and offer several different meats or proteins, along with sides. WF has a killer OATMEAL bar too, with steel cut oats, quinoa, and barley and fresh fruits and toppings.  DROOOOL! nnTIP  WATCH OUT FOR THURSDAY NIGHTS WHEN KIDS EAT FREE!  There will be a MOB of children in the prepared foodsburger counter. No matter how many kids you have, as long as the adult buys a burger meal, the kids get free ones.  I ran into one woman with SEVEN children, and all of them ate free. I swear, it took me  minutes to get my burger because of all the children. subtip the sweet potato fries are sometimes soggy as gym socks. Hey, if I had kids, I would DEFINITELY bring them here to eat free on Thursdays! nnSoups station is okay...though not all soups here are created equal.  The chicken dumpling always hits the spot, creamy and rich and full of dumplings.  The curry soups lack seasoning and depth. The vegetable soups can be thin. nnThe produce section is okay though sometimes you can tell when the prices get slashed, the produce isnt as fresh. Just keep your eyes peeled. nnNutrition bars aisle, is comprehensive and lots of the bars go on sale regularly. nnThe seafood and meats counter are good but really do lack some selection WF is famous for. I love how WF has a variety of fat percentages in their ground meats...and several different kinds of salmons.  nnI downright dislike the bakery section.  Ive bought several cake slices on different occasions and theyre not always the freshest.  A bit crumbly, or the frosting waxy.  nnTIP  When you buy  of something, you can usually get a case discount.  WF does this, and I would buy coconut waters or matcha green teas by the case.  At Earth Fare, you need to call ahead and ask for it.   I learned this the hard way when I tried to buy  yerba mate teas and got denied my discount. nnBOTTOM LINE I do love me some Earth Fare.  The people are always nice, and the service is good. There are some killer deals to find. There are good coupon books in the front too.  The selection is solid ...but  they better watch out, because in my book, Whole Foods is just a tad bit better."
1,"We travel often and sometimes stop in Las Vegas between flights to the East Coast or Midwest. I know there will be a longer leg ahead, so I will pick up food to eat on the plane. nnThe options at this airport are limited to fast food or sit down restaurants, so I decided to pick up a salad and sandwich for our dinner on the flight. Healthier options. nnI picked the Italian sandwich on Ciabatta bread with olive tapanade and the butterleaf lettuce salad. Both were great and easy to take and eat later."
1,"So I come here a lot because it is right in the midle between work and home, I usually order to go... i like this place because their prices are fair and ive never had a problem with smelly fish.  I love their hawaiian roll... Ive taking my sister here a couple time for all you can eat. defiently worth it. the best sushi ive had in vegas so far"
1,"I had a really nice experience at  Hair  Nails.  I received a manicure and  pedicure by Tricia.  She is friendly, very nice, and quite knowledgeable.  She has been doing nails a very long time and it shows.  I especially love my Rockstar toes and cant wait to go back for more!"
1,"Too bad you have to categorize. Not Mexican food, more like Mexicanstyle influences and flavors. Had dinner with my man here last night. Didnt know it was here. Free valet parking, so pull up to the hotel The Saguaro. Fun, popart atmosphere. Not a tequila drinker, but the best margarita ever. Super informative waiter on tequila. We tasted two different margaritas, Jef and Naranja Roja ?. They use fresh juices, lime salt and no icky sweetsour mixes. The delicate habanero chili finish on the Roja was so good!  Dont be afraid, not hot. Four,complimentary spicy sweet delicate corn breads about the size of a mans thumb were served next. Perfect blending of flavors. We started with the waiter excellently trained  knowledgeable recommends and shared everything. Ceviche de Kampachi served like sushi. Great textures and presentation. Very tasty. Pulpo al Carbon octopus flavors were great, but Im a texture girl and I just am not a huge fan of tentaclesso probably shouldnt have ordered ate it all though. Next we shared the jumbo grilled prawns with blistered cherry tomatoes. So many flavors playing nice together. Yum. I am super picky about eating lamb. It took me years to get over the nasty mint things restaurants do and just try it again. My favorite is right off the grillpit in the ground, tied up with lemons inside. The chef here does a process that partially cooks the meat in a Sous vide I looked it up and then finishes it on the grill. It is served on homemade chorizo with some lovely sheep crema like goat cheese and pipian verde smoky, mild with a microscopic hint of mint. This huge chop was cooked perfectly. I was surprised that it was on chorizo, which to me is either great or it sucks theirs was great. The food at Distrito is made by someone who really gets flavor and what works together. We ordered dessert because everything else was so good. Ive always wanted to taste dulce le leche and that was part of the dish, so we ordered it. Amazing, delicate orange flavors and this scoop of homemade citrus sherbet. You could build a life around that sherbet. Go here and have fun. They were having taco Tuesday, but we will go back for that."
1,This was my fave place to go after work when I lived in Tempe  worked at Borders and now I miss it so damn much.  Their tacos were just  the tops.n stars as once our server was just not on it.  But that was her fault.
1,"Great show at the Venetian. The YelpFacebook discount can save you some cash that you could use on some of their expensive drinks! The show lasts about an hour and a half and is nonstop. The accompanying band and variety of skits is awesome. There is a lot of audience participation and getting up close to these guys is kinda creepy.  The Blue Man Groups percussion skills is very admirable. nnI highly recommend it as a great night out in Vegas  loud music, strobe lights, and great comic routines. The only drawback was that near the end of the show, rolls of paper come down from the balcony to cover the crowd and it starts at the back of the auditorium and you are supposed to push it up towards the stage. The sheer volume of paper that came down caused our expensive drinks to fall out of the cupholders. If you attend and the paper starts falling, hold on to your drink."
1,"Good store.  I like going here because its NOT part of a mall.  It doesnt seem to be as hectic and busy as a mall Sears would be.  We ordered a product at a Sears in Tucson AZ, and than we picked it up here at Sears in Henderson NV.  The service was great, and the sale price was great too.  I compared the same product other places and this one seemed to be on the lower end compared ot Best Buy and several other electronics places."
1,"This place is stellar Mexican food.  So far I have yet to find a great Mexican spot, but this might be it.  I have had several dishes off of the menu which were all tasty.  nn     However the garlic shrimp was bomb, I love the beans here also.  I had the fried chicken I forgot the name, it was good however if it came with sauce it would be better so I added there chipotle cream which made it right.  Taquitos and imperial shrimp apps are delicious.  You have to order the lemonade agua fresco, so bomb I had about  glasses.  Im not a big Sangria drinker but even that was tasty. Desert the churros are so good, they come with a little cream filling and a banana foster sauce to dip them in.  Flan has a cheesecake like consistency which I like, because I dont care for traditional Flan and the eggy taste.  I will definitely go back. So many good dishes and Chef Paco can custom make dishes to your taste. nn     Some dishes are  and I think they could be a little cheaper however on average dishes are . Its good for groups and even coming in by yourself has a nice open layout and friendly staff.  If you come to Vegas for Mexican food near the strip or just good flavors, try it."
1,This dennys has changed a lot in the past  months. It appears a new manager or corporate finally came to visit and cleaned the place up. No more mad waitresses or  minute waits for  plate of food. Way to go.
1,"Love this place.Best smoothie place . Tons of healthy smoothies and healthy add ins . The meals are pretty good too , usually accompanied by fruit or chips .some tropical smoothies have drive thru and some are even  hours ."
1,"This is the gem of University City. nnIts laid back atmosphere hits you from the parking lot, with acoustic sounds and the tinkling of laughter and wine glasses. At least a dozen tables spill outside the doors, filled with patrons and their cherished pets on any warm evening. Its commonplace to have live music from the patio, but doesnt overpower the conversations or keep the dogs from lounging. The ambiance, especially with the views of the lake and paddle boats, allows you to shift your mind into thinking youre anywhere but a local hangout in the Piedmont of NC. nnThe Vault itself has tiny quarters, but stocks some welltreasured and fresh names, both in wine and brews. Snacks are available, with a varied assortment of cheeses, pretzels and party mix. Its very simple to walk in, make your selections, then take to the register for purchase. The only problem you may find are long lines, so I wouldnt wait until the last minute for a drink or the bathroom. nnIts worth a drive from anywhere in the Charlotte area to see what the UCB has been keeping to itself. This place is equally impressive for the intimate conversation of a first date, relaxing with a group of friends after work, or bringing your dog for some appreciative petting from strangers. If youre single, the last one is especially fun."
1,"Ready to Go Back for Dinner!nnReview is for BAR  LOUNGE areannWent on a Thursday night... it the bar.. not the main dining area which was hopping...was pretty quiet around pm when we walked in and sat down at the bar... the bartenders were busy filling orders but all took time to say Hi and welcome us.nnWe enjoyed a couple drinks and a snack... nnNOTE  all drinks can be tweaked to your discretion per the bartenders... so if the main liquor is gin.... you can sub vodka... or make up your own concoction... they are game therennRamble Tasty  Light  Refreshing  Dangerous because you could drink way too many of these and then when you stand up... BAM... itll hit younI dont remember what all it had in it sorry... but it had muddled raspberries and vodka and shave ice and something else... Yes... its a Girlie Drink... and Im a Girl... so YUM!nnDark  Stormy base is dark rum with ginger and lemon... and I think club soda for a bit of fizz... in any case... it held up to its name... dark with flavor explosions... the ginger really complements the rum in a way I would never have imagined... it is a unique taste.. and you have to like ginger...  unlike the Ramble... I dont think I could drink a bunch of these in one sittingnnTarte Flambee so this was a mistake on the bartender... we wanted the Apple Tart and somehow he heard Tarte Flambee... go figure... but it was a TASTY MISTAKE... Im not complaining...nIts like a flatbread with caramelized onions, ham and cheese...nIn any case... melt in your mouth... my mouth did a little dance of happiness.... It is RICH... so only a few pieces need be enjoyed.nnGotta go back because the main dining area has tables against the window that overlooks LVB.    And they have patio seating too which sounds like loads of fun when the temp heats up to dine outdoors."
1,Some real good food here.  Best Reuben Ive ever had from here. I have loved every appetizer I have tried.  Large selection of beer and whiskey.  If they had a better red wine selection id go  stars.  I love to play trivia here.
1,"When my BFF when on a rave about this olive oil place that she had found, I thought to myself... hmmm sounds interesting, but I certainly wasnt breaking any speed limits to get there. And yet today I barely had one foot in the door when I realized the error of my dismissive ways! It wasnt that I didnt know these things existed. Quite contraire. But until now there was no place on the west side that one could do tastings and pairings. This is essential if you are a little obsessive about cooking.nnI dont even quite know where to begin except to say that I seriously had to control my urge to buy one of each. And as the lovely couple that owns the establishment was packing up my case yes I said case, I decided that this was potentially a dangerous place for me to frequent.nnThey have a selection of both nine plain  which is sort of a misnomer as you can make your selection from mild to robust flavors  and twelve flavored oils. Flavored oils that made the cut today were the all natural buttered which I have already lightly drizzled over steamed veggies and had I not known, would have thought I was being overly sinful. The owner suggested a light sprinkle over pop corn and I am SO there with her on that one! The next up was basil. Fresh and herby  the mix of the crisp OO combined with the sweet smoothness of the basil... well lets just say yum!  Garlic was the third one that made its way in to the box. This EVOO will be a staple in lightly flavoring the pan on anything Mediterranean or Italian that passes  across my stove top. The organic Tuscan herb is the obvious choice for dipping either crudites or crusty bread  this one is so popular they were temporarily out, so I was only able to sample. Trust me  I will be back for this one!  The final oil that came home was the one of the three specialty oils. I chose the toasted almond. This one is a couple of dollars more, but wow! This would be phenomenal for a healthier baking substitute, any kind of salad with a nutty flair, fruit... I swear you could drizzle this on ice cream.nnAnd that leads me to the balsamics. They have  flavored traditional reds,  whites, and  specialties. Today I picked up the strawberry to pair with the basil OO. Sprinkle this combination over some watermelon with mint and no one will be able to resist you! I snagged the white cranberry pear for its tart start with a sweet finish. I cant wait to use this in my fall recipes and have already started working up ideas for holiday meals that will star this little number. The dark chocolate is going to be perfect with strawberries and Im pretty sure when paired with the toasted almond oil will be sublime.nnWhen all was said and done, I had filled up the better part of a case and had a smile from ear to ear. Now looking back at their website I am kicking myself for not having tried at least  other items. I will have to settle for creating my own combinations of flavors until I return to add to the collection.nnThe best part of all of this is that is is actually reasonably priced for the quality, quite a decent value when you consider that you will be using teaspoons or at most a tablespoon to produce huge flavors, and is a vast improvement healthwise as a substitute for more traditional alternatives.nnThey have a punch card program that earns your free products and are open  days a week. I dearly hope people try this place and keep it afloat. It is without a doubt, my new crush!"
1,"Always have since day one going here and always will love this place.nnI was surprised that I have not been here for a while and one of the young ladies there remembered me, the food I eat and how I like my tea.  They have the best black tea I have ever had and for someone to remember you when you are only a customer is amazing.nnI highly recommend this place for food and drink as well as a great place to just hang out."
1,"Freddy from Fox plumbing is a good as they come. Had the best prices, perfect timely  work and is very friendly and nice. Came all the way out to Goodyear from Phoenix. Was in contact with me the whole time he was on his way out to our house and didnt mind all the questions I was asking him while he was working. Stayed on task the whole time and did an amazing job installing out new shower faucet set. I will be referring Freddy to everyone I know and he will be my plumber for LIFE ! ! ! Thank you Freddy........."
1,"The sign out front states that this place was rated one of the top  sports bars in the US by some organization. I totally get why. Hundreds of tvs everywhere and at every angle ensure that there isnt a bad spot in the house. nnThe furniture is perfectlyplaced so that everyone who has a table feels like they have their own private space while surrounded by hundreds. Prices are moderate. It being Vegas, there is a sports book area just below the monstersized main screen."
1,This is one of the best and the most interesting club Ive been to! The shows do run around half an hour and the club is pretty clean comparing to some dirty ones Ive been to. The music is awesome!!! Remember to check their FB page then send them a text to be on the guest list. You still have to wait for a little bit to get in but its totally worth it. Not a big club but definitely a different one!!! Really enjoyed it.
1,"If you want to have one of the best meals of your life, Raku is where you want to go. It is expensive and small portions, however each tiny plate offers more awesome than some restaurants can deliver during an entire dinner service. nnI convinced my boyfriend to let me do the ordering, and he was not disappointed. Everything was delicious, but some of my favorites were the scallop, the lamb chop, and baconwrapped tomatoes. Bacon makes everything better. The house sake was very good quality, reasonably priced and, naturally, made the evening that much more enjoyable. nnWith dinner finished and the sake gone, there was only one logical decision to make we had to have dessert. There were so many delectable options to choose from, but we eventually decided on the Fluffy Cheesecake and the Chocolate Cake. Each were the best of their kind. RIch, creamy, and heavenly are just a few ways to describe them both.nnThe entire meal was well beyond our expectations, making the triple digit check a little easier to pay."
1,"Just redic my friends. Just redic. nnThe service is absolutely stellar and very helpful in helping you decide what youll enjoy based on your appetite, craving and personal taste. nnThe food? What can I possibly say that others on here havent already said? Its fcking amazing! Absolutely incredible culinary creations. Dont skip the foie gras, especially if youre going back home to lessthanfoiefriendly California, OMGOMGOMG, so savory, so decadent.nnTheir desserts, dont leave the MGM without trying at least  of em, wow, just wow.nnWhatever it takes, save your pennies, stay away from those darn penny slots and get your butt in here for dinner, especially if youre lucky enough to have someone special in your life to bring with you! D"
1,"GREAT NORTHWEST PHOENIX POOL CARE AND REPAIR!!! nnI had a breakage problem with my pc pipes and in floor cleaning system. I tried reaching my pool company of  years but they said it would be  days before they could assist me. At the recommendation of a friend, I tried Island Life Pools and Spas. The company looked at the problem that day and the very next day fixed the pipes and the pool runs great. I highly recommend Island Life for their fast service, quick repair, and fantastic pricing! After this amazing experience with the repair, I am going to use them for maintenance in the future."
1,This is the mall I go to when its to hot to visit Town Square or for something different. They have alot of stores I like and the food court is nice. They even have a toddler play area there..which can be handy after a few hours of your little one being in a stroller.nDuring Easter they have a cute bunny for the kids to take pix with but  Xmas the Santa is better  Town Square. He has his own house there.nI still manage to get here every couple of weeks and usually leave with a bag from somewhere..
1,"This atmosphere at Zinc is strangely casual for what many would consider an expensive, upscale restaurant. The walls are busy, the ceiling is jammed with fans and enough lights for you to question why its dim inside. There is a rather tacky eiffel tower in the center, but the cuisine of this place isnt very French at all.nnThe food was good, a bit salty, but good. The spinach and frisee salad was very simple. The egg on top was perfectly poached and the dressing was great. nnThe cheese selection was good, as was the drinks. Some of the meat was improperly served  cuts that should not be sliced, but tender. nnOverall, a good dinner but overpriced IMO. It was not special or delicious enough to warrant the high price tag."
1,This is one of my favorite Burger joint in Vegas the food is really great and fairly priced . The employees are very helpful and attentive ... the dinning area and kitchen are very clean . I would defently eat there again and again .
1,"This was my nd time to visit the show and it exceeded my expectation again. Some acrobats were not as impressive as others, but the stage sets, the music, the costume, the choreography...everything matches and creates the totally magical artistic fair.nnYes, it is expensive, but I would say it is still the best show in LV."
1,"Matt Kazam is so right on with his hysterical observations of being over . Love his comedy, his interaction with audience, his delivery  couldnt have asked for more. I was a bit leery at first because I saw another comedy show at Riviera several years ago and it was pitiful, but we gave it a try and havent stopped talking about it since. Matt is well worth the price of admission. I hope his show takes off like Vinnie Favorito has. Matt deserves a long successful career. A definite Must see when you get to Vegas. Not a fancy showroom, but small and perfect for a fairly prices night of laughter. nOh! One last thing  Matts show is funny for all ages, not just those over . There were a few  somethings in the audience who were laughing out loud also  possibly from the fear of what Matt was talking about. What Matt says is all real kids...brace yourselves!"
1,"Usually love this place, go almost everytime we are in vegas.  Just be sure to check the band before you go.  some are definately better than others.  I love that the waitress who works here always remembers me and my fiance.  and we only go once or twice a year.  I was very impressed by that."
1,"Before Precision Performance, I was a crooked mechanics favorite customer.  Greedy eyes light up when this tiny, young looking, carclueless, girl would walk in to a shop.  Something about me screams Sucker, and Ive literally been told that I needed parts replaced that dont even exist on my car.   Enter Precision PerformancennRecommended by a long time customer, I cringed as usual when I showed up with a brake problem, expecting it would cost hundreds to correct.  I left that day having paid  in labor with brakes that felt like new.  When it was just dust, they didnt pretend it was anything bigger.  That was a delightfully new experience for me.  Since then,  Toyotas later, I hate when I have to take my car elsewhere.  Most recently my transmission looked to be on its way out.  Another mechanic told me hands down, it would need to be replaced, there were no other possibilities.  Precision Performance found a warranty I didnt know I had.  Theyd conferred with someone they trusted at a dealership who was expecting my call to replace a computer.  It solved the problem and saved me thousands.  When more expensive work is unavoidable theyll advise me in what I need to do to drive safely now, and what we can wait to revisit on the next service.  Uneducated as I am, following their advice has kept me off the side of the road and with no need for tow trucks for years.nnOutside of their work and honesty, I like them as people.  Their staff is friendly and always make time to answer my questions.  Its a no frills shop, dont expect anything fancy, but there is good reason that many of these reviews come from customers who have been loyal to Precision Performance for years."
1,"Hard not to give this place a good review. I  saved this spot for a special occasion and couldnt be happier... Maggie made a fresh cocktail at the bar using lemon juice and egg whites.nnChristina offered great suggestions, including the pork belly, the egg plant humus and deviled eggs are you kidding me! and the great wine list. Russian River wines never disappoint.nnEvery dish seemed to have great contrast whether it was sweet and vinegary, crispy and rich, or savory and tart.nnAttention to detail elevated this restaurant. It deserves to be in the Mint museum of art. Northerners and Foodies take notice."
1,"Awesome experience.  Was in with a group of  from New York from Homecoming and this place couldnt have been a more perfect fit.  Went for dinner on Friday night  and then came back during Freakfest.  nnThe food was great.  I had the meatball sandwich but as a group we sampled a bunch of things.  Mac and Cheese side is a must. nnDrinks also really good.  Get the Farley  trust me.  nnThe entire staff couldnt be nicer.  Chef came out and is incredibly passionate about his food.  Doug, the coowner, was incredibly friendly and helpful.  nnThis place is a perfect addition to State Street.  Well be back.nnJason"
1,Had dinner there last week and the food was amazing.  Ordered the three course meal and loved everything.  The bartender mixed up a surprise drink and I was not disappointed.  I would recommend Crudo to anyone who loves great food.
1,"I was left speechless..... What more could you ask for in a  pizza that cooks in a minute AND is perfected in its taste and ingredients. We split two pizzas, the Italian Stallion and the Dolce Diavolo which comes with Sopressata, Calabrian Chiles, Fresh Basil and Honey crazy combo but totally works! nI equally loved both pizzas so much and killed almost two whole ones by myself the other couple that came with us couldnt finish all their and I gladly helped. Like other reviewers, the crust was perfectly charred and the only thing I could compare it to was a marshmallow. When you roast marshmallows and make that perfect one that has that golden brown char on the outside and its cooked just enough on the inside to where its creamy and tender... Thats what this crust is like! Best pizza Ive ever had!"
1,"I just bought a car here on June , . The first time I came here was to check out a  Corolla in June . The salesman told me he had to run my credit before I could even see their stock. I said hell no and walked right back to my car. As I walked to my car, a salesman by the name of Erick came up and spoke to me. I proceeded to test drive the Corolla that day without any pressure to buy. I came back a year later to look for a  Camry with lower miles to replace my  Camry. As I was pulling in, I noticed they had a beautiful black  Accord V Coupe on the used lot, which is my dream car. I came by, test drove it, and bought it two days later. Erick and his sales partner, Eldon told me that the car was going to the auction to clear out their inventory for more used cars after I test drove it. I told them I wouldnt be able to pick it up until  days later, and they worked something out with their used car manager, and  days later I traded in my beloved Camry with k miles for my Accord. They gave me a great price on the Accord at a great rate, and gave me a lot more for my Camry than I was expecting. Scott in finance was great to work with as well, didnt try to force me into buying unnecessary addons or upgrades. I was in and out of there within an hour. If you need a new or used car, see Erick or Eldon."
1,This is a frequent place we order from for work.  I must say that the food is consistently GREAT!  I could probably eat here a couple times a week but for lunch everyday its a little pricy with delivery charge.  On the healthy side I usually get the grilled chicken teriyaki lunch with salad.  The chicken pad thai is amazing.  My boss always orders the beef pad thai.  I think we have tried a little of everything and have always been pleased.  The service is always great and the deliveries are always fast.  Will continue ordering from Satay. Im a big fan.
1,My first FROST experience was yesterday during a mid day shopping experience.  Perfect day to have a refreshing treat to help beat the heat. Im a huge fan of Gelato Spot matter of fact that is the only Gelato I like. Tempted to try something new Im glad I did. The flavoring off all the flavors I sampled were amazing. Tempting to only want to try them all based on all the delightful colors neatly displayed it is hard to resist. I settled on my favorite Raspberry. I was offered a free regular cone topped with a small wafer cookie. It hit the spot. They do also offer freshly made in house waffle cones to purchase.nnThe staff was a great crew. All smiles and friendly the moment you walked through the door. I was even asked if I wanted some water while sitting down enjoying my new favorite treat. You can dine in or outside the establishment.
1,"Pamelas is THE PLACE to go if you love pancakes in the morning! Yes, its cash only and yes, there will be a wait but its SO worth it! I always get the chocolate chip banana hot cakes and I have never had hot cakes so thin and light but so indulgent at the same time. Order the whipped cream on the sideits a a rush of sugary goodness otherwise. But thats not always a bad thing. Their coffee is good too. Service is usually slow and not the friendliest but this is one of those places where the wait is so long they want to get you in and out as quickly as possible. This is also a great place to take out of towners for breakfasteven the Obamas loved it!"
1,"Beer and a buttload of poutine. Im not going to act like a poutine connoisseur, I live in Canada, I eat poutine not regularly but whenever I want, La Banquise is the shit. You go, if youre lucky the line isnt too long, have a beer or two with your small or large poutine. I really like the B.O.M. because I really like Bacon, Onion and Mushrooms. Simple."
1,Probably the first time Ive had a chicken basket that the chicken was not horribly deep fried.   The breading was flaky and perfectly balanced with the moisture of the chicken.nNeedless to say forget the other big name places best chicken basket Ive ever had.
1,The boule is unmatched anywhere in town. It induced a brief and poignant moment of Proustian reverie.  The baguette is also a good facsimile to what I remember in its homeland.  The croissant flies into a million flakes on first bite this is a good thing!. The strip mall is a draw back for any dine in.
1,"Das Hotel ist neu und modern, die Lobby wirkt frisch und freundlich.nAuch die Mitarbeiterin sind sehr hilfsbereit.nAllerdings lungern vor dem Hotel hueufiger Obdachlose, auch der Tiefgaragenbereich wirkt sehr schmuddelig und sehr teuer.  EURTag, wenn man rausfuehrt, wird es noch teurernDie Zimmer sind okay, normale Grufudfe. Das Bad klein, Dunst zieht schlecht ab. Betten empfanden wir als unbequem.nWellnessBereich dafufcr TOP! Sehr schufn. Es fehlt nur noch der SwimmingPool...n... fufcr ein Novotel ist dieses Hotel sehr teuer. Allerdings sieht es echt schufn aus und bietet Service und Qualituet, die ufcber dem Novotel Standard ist."
1,"This is one of my alltime favorite breakfast joints. I dont know why. The food isnt that spectacular. I think its the creativity of the items and large menu selection that sticks me. nnTheres also two vegetarian items that are really good The Veggie Benny vegetarian eggs benedict and the Veggie Croissant with garlic mayo so good, make me wanna slap yo momma. nnTheyre prices are a little steep, being a breakfast place in Summerlin. And they get totally hammered during prime breakfast hours, so Id recommend going sub primetime. They have indoor and uncovered outdoor seating. nnGet the coffee cake. The Kickin Potatoes their spunkedup version of potatas bravas are supposed to be a signature item ... they aight. nn off the strip, noncasino"
1,"We looooooooooove four peaks! They have an awesome selection of food, the atmosphere is fantastic and the service is awesome! This is one of our favourite places in the valley to go to! Not to mention there beer is tasty!!!  goooo now you wont be disappointed!!! And eat the beer stout tiramisu!!! Its heaven!!!! Yummmmm"
1,"Pleased with the faster, free wifi here!nHot outside over  degrees, ac inside!!nXhausted from the weekendnnIm at the airport right now waiting to fly back to SJC! This is a pretty BIG airport! Im glad the free wifi here is MUCH faster!!! Im also grateful to be inside the airport and not outside right now. Ive had enough heat for the year! P Security was quick and painless!nnFYI For pickup there are  locations north, south, and east. So know where you are getting picked up ahead of time!"
1,"Phranks was the best food we had this weekend in Vegas.   FYI, the meal before Phranks was at Mesa Grill....Bobby could learn a lot from Phrank. nnPhrank himself was behind the counter.  Cheerful and genuinely interested in his customers input, Phrank really wants you to enjoy his food.  nnI had a fish taco plate that rocked.  The fish was supercrispy on the outside and perfect on the inside.  The cabbage and creamy cilantro sauce were awesome.  Phrank let us try all his salsas and I would say his regular red was my fave...you must order the roasted jalapenos...he marinates them in some sort of lime concoction so they have a tasty spicy tang to them.nnMy wife had a torta adobada that I would say was a cross of a torta and a pulled pork sammie...different than tortas I have had in the past, but really good."
1,"I love this shop and the owner is wonderful! Brigitte always wants to know what youre working on and is always willing to listen and give advice. My intown family shops here for my birthday and Christmas gifts, and Brigitte uses the opportunity to suggest things Im nervous about   she suggested that one family member get me a gift certificate for the upcoming sock class taught by Bev, who is a great teacher, very patient and helpful, but left it open for me to use it on other things if I preferred I took the class, and Im glad I did, it was great.nnKlose Knit has a great selection of yarn, especially considering how small the store is. Ive found a few that I am totally addicted to now. In addition, when I needed yarn for baby blankets for my cousins, Brigitte pointed me to one kind of yarn and even ordered a few colors for me.nnBrigitte also runs a knitting night on the first Monday of the month at Kaldis inside Schnucks in Urbana."
1,"Crazy good sesame bread, they make it fresh everyday. Lamb kebabs were very good,  came with bread, salad, French fries. We also got hummus, very fresh, and a pide. The place is such a complete dive that my husband wanted to turn around and leave,  but it is worth it. If I lived in Pitts, Id eat that bread all the time.nThey deliver, too, and are super friendly."
1,Fantastic pizza and very nice people!  I was looking for a good thin crust pizza close to my home and decided to try this place out.  The pizza was fantastic and the ingredients were high quality and very fresh.  nnI was so tired of paying Scottsdale type pizza prices and was very happy to find this very affordable and very tasty pizza joint.  The pizza is better than the other nearby pizza competitors and its half the price!  I highly recommend it.
1,"I really dont know why some people have given this place such bad reviews. Picky eaters maybe? I have tried Chinese food in NY, NJ and most places in Charlotte and this is one of the top Chinese places in my book. Fast delivery, food is great. This is more of a takeoutdelivery place so dont expect  star restaurant treatment when you go for dine in. You will get paper plates and plastic utensils. By the way, you have to order the general tsaos wings and they usually have a coupon online."
1,"Excellent rapport qualitueprix pour le Brunch, probablement imbattable ue Montrueal. Cuisine ue la fois inventive et parfaitement maueetrisuee. Service souriant et efficace. Je recommande vivement!"
1,"I am a single mom of   boys and I take them to Hair Mechanix. I am very picky as to how people cut their hair. Every time I go they get a different stylist and I have been impressed every time. I even went once and was pleased with my hair cut. They offer a great price and the their customer service is good as well. The only thing I can probably complain about is the parking, They are located in a very small shopping center but if you go during the week parking is easy to find."
1,"Wow. How have I not gone to this place sooner?!?! My favorite fast food place in the midwest wasis Steak N Shake and this tastes pretty darn similar. The burgers are thin, but cooked to a crispy perfection  the fries are thin and awesome as well. On my first trip, I had the patty melt, which was awesome. On my second trip, I had a burger and it was amazing. And on my third trip, I went for the hot dog and it was outstanding  Have yet to be disappointed by the food at Freddys. nnNext, we have the customer service here, which is top notch. There are a bunch of young kids behind the counter, but they all seem to have an impeccable work ethic and great manners. I dont know how the managers go about their hiring process, but theyre doing a great job. nnLastly, frozen custard... just do it. You wont regret it"
1,Best for takeout... Service has never been stellar for sure but I am in LOVE with their Vientiane Fried Rice wTofu... IMHO the best fried rice in town. Great hangover medicine... large portions and they arent kidding about their spiciness yowza!
1,"As a new knitter, I need as much guidance as I can get.  The store owner started me out knitting a scarf, taught me how to cast on and knit for the first time very patiently, might I add, helped me finish my work, and is continually helping me with new projects.  Shes so gracious and an expert at her craft and her selection is awesome!  I can always find what I needwant.  Very homelike and comfortable!  This place is full service.  I wouldnt go anywhere else."
1,"Finally a new restaurant in the Summerlin Area that looks like its going to make it! I was getting so tired of the same old restaurants. Great food, atmosphere and service! And yes.... have the fried chicken sandwich!!"
1,"While slightly out of the way in the old State building across the street from the Wyndham ie old Hilton, this place is pretty cool.nnFirst, the interior is modern, clean, cool patterned wood ceiling.  Its a relatively small place, with large glass windows in the bottom floor.  The large pizza oven makes up the bulk of the behindthecounter space.nnService was friendly and perfect.nnI ate the Torino sandwich  think Italian deli sandwich on a roll, but toasted.  Wouldnt go so far to call it a hoagie though.....The mix of sauceoils was very tasty..... The sandwich, while better than average, still lacked the certain hoagie punch. More meat maybe? More cheese? I have a tendency to prefer baked hoagies over simply toasting them.......nnThe recommended pizza was a basic Bianca pizza with a light oiltomato sauce, and no cheese.  It was good  although this makes me hungry for more cheesier, meatier options.  The crust was darker  this seems to be a trend  many reviews and pictures have almost burnt crust.  Which I think is borderline acceptable.nnI do like the San Pellegrino Orange available there as well!nnDespite the minor issues, I see great promise here and I think theres a chance I might take another walk at some point and sample some other dishes."
1,"I used to avoid the optometrist like some people avoid the dentist. Nobody seemed to get my Rx right . Dr Wong actually got me into glasses that dont give me headaches. Staff is professional and friendly. nONLY gripe is their referral incentive program. My mom went there per my recommendation and spent about  on exam and  pairs of glasses. Months later at my annual exam, I had to ask the person three times about getting a  coffee shop gift card.  Thank you for making me feel like a cheap a."
1,"Ok, if I lived in the area, THIS is where I would get my car serviced all the time! Hubby and I are visiting from California...woke up this morning, and the Ravioli our RAV wouldnt start. We had this problem a month before and were told by our local Toyota service peeps it was the battery...so they replaced the battery. Fast forward to now, were in Arizona, and Ravi doesnt start. Kind of concerned since we DROVE here  we want to get home safely. Were staying in Phoenix area but the two other Toyota dealerships I called couldnt squeeze us in. Big Two was the last one I called, and by far the friendliest from the moment they answered the phone. I spoke with Ken he said they were all booked up, but once I mentioned we were from California and making the trek back home on Monday, he said he would squeeze us in. Once we got there, we received nothing but excellent, friendly service. Waiting was not an issue since  we expected to have to wait and  the waiting areacafe is beautiful! Complimentary coffee, water, bagels, big screen tv, and jungle gym for the kids...really NICE setup!!! The bathrooms were nice and clean  AND Ken gave us a choice of a complimentary manipedi or a haircut...what?????? Seriously!!! We only had to wait about an hour and a half  if that. They couldnt find a problem with our car but neither could they find a problem a month ago...which wasnt too reassuring, but in terms of customer service  hands down  it was fantastic!!! ...and I love my pedi! One of the best Ive had!!!"
1,"The best cheese steak Ive ever had.  Chopped thin rib eye, caramelized onions, a saucy and flavorful cheese melt  no mystery pieces, no fatty pieces, all meat seasoned perfectly on a delicious sub roll.  Eggplant parm hero  awesome thin breaded eggplant with just the right amount of sauce and cheese on a nice sub roll.  nThe Greek side salad had fresh cucumber, grape tomato, red onion and feta.  All this and they sell lovely Italian grocery items.   nnI will be returning very soon based upon my experience today."
1,"Patricia is the best!  I was feeling really, really sick one Sunday afternoon.  I felt like I was coming down with the flu.  I called Patricia and she told me to come right over.  I firmly believe that her treatment headed off what could have been a really nasty bug.  She has treated me many times since and I am always better for it.  nHer office has always been immaculately clean and Patricia herself has always been caring and concerned about my good health."
1,"This is our favorite Mexican Restaurant in Phoenix! On the main menu, everything is great and consistently great.. My favorite, are the Pork Chops, that have an amazing rub, and cant be beat!! Also, love the happy hour menu.. Price and portions and quality are incredible!! Love their Happy Hour Nachos and Mexican Pizza. . domestic beers!!! nTry Nandos. You wont be disappointed!!"
1,"I was lucky enough to get invited to the BestOfVegas.com party that was located at the SugarCane.  nnIt is a bit hard to find, feels a bit out of the way, but once you are there, it is a rockin good time! nnVery eclectic feeling, and dark.  The bar staff was incredibly efficient, and the gogo dancers were cute, and talkative.nnIt was a really great night, because Kourtney Kardashian and Niky Hilton were there, so that really rocked!nnI will deff be back!"
1,"I was pretty impressed by the buffet at Harrahs  we ended up here after watching the Legends show meh at around pm.  The servers were super nice, and kept us filled with drinks.  I am not usually a huge buffet person, but I gave it the good old college try...nnAnd ended up eating my body weight in shellfish.  Aint no shame in it.nnWoo!nnSeriously though, my dad and I are big fans of crab and shrimp, so we were in heaven.  The Italian food wasnt bad, and my parents really liked the BBQ dishes.  The salad was only okay, but who goes to a buffet for salad anyway?  The desserts were plentiful and they even offered sugarfree versions of cheesecake and mousse perfect for my mom and dad as well as gelato and cotton candy.  If you have a good plan of attack, you will totally enjoy this buffet!"
1,"The fiance had a conversation with his  coworkers about their favorite food spots and this came up a few times. Ive heard of it, but were not around this area often, but decided to head down. Ive been looking for some new Mexican eateries. nnThe food is more Yucatan region judging from some of their menu offerings and the way they cook their staples. Its a bit different from what Im used to, but I liked it. nnI got a combo of chicken tamales and chicken enchiladas which comes with red sauce but I asked for green and the fiance got cheese enchilada and chicken tamale. The tamale was stuffed with chicken and had a tomato sauce over it. I think I prefer a bit more masa, but this was quality. Enchilada also was plentiful with chicken in it and I enjoyed their green sauce. The beans is more pureed than what I do and had a interesting roasty flavor about it. Rice was standard, but good.nnThe service was friendly and good. We both appreciated that we were able to sub minor things in our combo with no problems. We were checked on often and drinks were refilled.We came at not a busy time, and in the areas where people werent sitting, some of the staff were doing some cleaning and prepping before dinner. Definitely appreciate a place that is cleaning daily.nnIll definitely be back. Its not the style of Mexican food I grew up with, but its nice to shake it up sometimes. Ill try something that is more Yucatan like the panuchos next time."
1,"First time here in July with my son and his father. The servers were not grouchy at all. Very helpful and patient in taking our orders, maybe because there was no line  but what the hey. I got double stamps for checking in. nMy son ordered the vanilla shake while his dad the strawberry flavor. They liked their drinks well enough. I had iced green tea. It was a little watered down.nThey have big comfy seats. Free use of board games and books. Clean restroom. nAll in all a nice, cozy place to hang out without the noisy younger crowd at the other coffee shop."
1,"What a great place. I love the idea they have come up with. The servers are all volunteers and so is much of the other staff.  All the profits and tips go to feed people in need.  Cool idea!  Then, the food is also great!  What a peaceful and enjoyable place."
1,"This is a must stop whenever I am in Vegas. Its cheap, fast, yummy. When I say fast... I mean all the hours they are open except between amam when all the clubgoers are getting their hunger fixes. Attempting to grab a pizza during those hours mean  hour wait. AnnYou can grab a slice or a whole pizza. They have some ready to go ranging from pepperoni, cheese, combo, and white slice. Recently they even had a deep dish version of the white slice, looked awesome but a bit much for me. You could also add toppings to all he slices and they will stick it in the oven for you.  nnMy goto slice is simple white slice with roasted tomatoes. The ricotta and white sauce combined with the tangy tomatoes is out of this world. The only thing I would recommend they change would be to add fresh chopped garlic to their menu.  I made the mistake of getting  whole pizzas with extra garlic, only to find they use powered garlic which left an awful aftertaste in my mouth."
1,"My first time at this particular REI, the layout is always pretty much the same.  The employees are about  to helpful and knowledgeable to collage kids working to get by and learning.  I dont have a problem with that because if they dont know they will usually find someone who does.nnWe are members and we had a problem with a sleeping pad we bought about a year ago that started to deflate.  Well, normally you would think geesh a year and youre trying to return?!  You have to understand a sleep pad is only used a few times a year and with proper storage it should last longer then  or  uses so yes we wanted an exchange.  We are members and you have up to a year for a return with a receipt  We know we would have to pay the difference not a problem for us to have a still workable pad.  The woman at the counter was helpful and did everything as far as searching this side of the coast to find a replacement, as we said we would pay the difference for a new one because ours was discontinued but we would prefer equal to slightly higher value.  This was above her knowledge at that point so she called another girl over to help us in this area we started to hunt for a pad that was a good size and comfort in a comparable price, she knew her stuff in this area!  nnThat truly is a reason to buy high end equipment you buy good maybe more expensive and you buy less often, worth the money?  What are you paying for my opinion is here you are paying for great knowledgable service from people who are going to go above and beyond to keep this kind of place open.  They also have tons of specialty gear that is pretty hard to find this quality and selection in other stores.nnMy first time in this location and they lived up to the expectations I had from the other location, good work guys!"
1,"The prices and serving sizes are amazing! Aside from that, the food is COMPLETELY authentic and the family who runs the restaurant are all super friendly. I highly recommend this place, I absolutely love it!"
1,"Major plus for being the closest place to Tempe Mission Palms to sell beer to go.  Literally a half a block away!  nnI also tried their Chicago Dog  fresh tomatoes, sport peppers, relish, pickle, mustard, and celery salt.  All for ..  A"
1,I stopped in randomly for lunch the other day and it was great. there was a longer line but thought it must be worth it.  the line moved pretty fast due to the guy behind the register.  he moved the line along with speed and not at the expense of the customer.  funny guy.  the burrito was perfect and delicious.  I will visit Johnny Burrito often when i buy lunch in town.
1,"I LooooVE this hotel!! The workers are so friendly and helpful. We have stayed there  times. Last time they gave us a super room, I dont even know for how much it was but we paid for a standard room and they gave us a room which was like  sq feet with a Jacuzzi. Actually there were two rooms in one suite. Also they serve the best free drinks...They taste really good, not crappy like in other hotels. OK, its not a fancy hotel but its a really nice and affordable place. Thank you."
1,Mix is actually a restaurant that turns into a lounge club at pm. Its located on the top floor of TheHotel at Mandalay Bay. Since its basically a roof top barrestaurant the view is amazing. You have the option to either sit in our outside on huge comfy couches while taking in the view. The drinks are strong and delicious. They start off around  a piece. Try the Violet. The decor is sophisticated and trendy. The music is the latest and the club is always packed. Mix is a definite must see.
1,". stars.  Theres something weirdly charming about Homme.  Not sure if its the cheap drinks, the crowd, the converted twostory house layout, the Central Phoenix club circuit regulars, or the fact that its constantly evolving  adding DJsnights seemingly all the time.  nnI went here the other night for Fridays relocated French Kiss newwaveindiepunkelectro dance party and have to say it was a blast.  I had been here a few times before  once on a Thursday night with Bonnie, once for Tuesday night karaoke, and even when it was a creepy old fogey gay bar a few years ago.nnThe space is just right for the dance party, and the upstairs DJdancefloor area lends itself well to those who are seeking an added bonus  in this case, deep house.  The decor here is OK, nothing special, really  although it is more brightly lit, and brightly painted than it used to be.  Lots of nooks and crannies here and an intimidating narrow spiral staircase, which is good if you get bored with conventional spaces.nnThe crowd is diverse gay, straight, black, white, brown, whatevs and depending on the night its crawling with hipsters, club kids and electronew waveindietribalhousebreakbeat aficionados.  These are the types of people who go somewhere for the music and could give an eff about anything else.  With the clientele and music selection, Homme has the feel of a more cosmopolitan LASF dance club, but without the attitude.nnHomme will be seeing more of Stevey, no doubt."
1,"I enjoyed my visit to the castle. Note, buy tickets online the night before otherwise you will be in a line for over half an hour on any normal day. There are a lot of noncastlerelated things in here so I would consider it more of a general Edinburghian ? museum.nnMore advice on the website, I failed to buy tickets beforehand and then I tried to use my phone to buy tickets in real time. The site had, predictably, failed. So if you try to be clever like that, it may not work."
1,"Bachi Burger brings together my two favorite things  Asian Flavorings and Burgers. I cant pinpoint which one is my favorite because they are all different lies, its the Miyagi Sans burger but, I didnt want to hurt the others feelings. All I can say is that when you add an egg to a burger, it intensifies the flavors of the burger with the burst of the egg yolk. droolsnI cant say I am a fan of the oxtail fries OR the truffle fries but, the burger is enough to fill you up and doesnt really need extras as its the STAR of the show. nnTry the vietnamese coffee to finish your meal but, order it half way through your burger, as it takes a bit to brew. A nice mix of condensed milk and flavorful coffee."
1,"The chef is to be commended. Considering there are no meal items over  calories, the food is delicious. I had the chile relleno appetizer with goat cheese and pico de gallo. It was perfect! I followed with the pork tenderloin entree and Wow!!!! Another home run. The service was a bit slow, but they were really busy so I guess it was worth the wait. I will definitely be back and I do recommend you try Seasons  for a special dining experience."
1,"This would probably be a  star review, for yep, its a chain store that sells organic dog food and treats, stuff is usually in stock, nothing great nothing really wrong, only the staff here is pretty amazing. We have a ridiculously shy little Corgior rather I should say had. The staff here is all great with dogs, and all apparently have treats in every pocket.nnWe ended up visiting them every  days for about  months, just little  minute, Hey, were gonna go walk through the store, buy you a treat and let you meet people who we know are going to be super gentle and nice with you. And by about trip , Going To Petco is now one of our pups favorite activities. The staff were never put upon by our tiny crying pup, and theyve always been very helpful while we were looking for one product or another. nnThe only complaint I have is that they are often out of Bully Sticks, alas."
1,"I bought a car at Sanderson Volvo back in September, a  Mustang. Wow, did I get a great deal! My sales man, Joe Cavaretta, was possibly the nicest sales guy Ive ever met. He didnt pressure, he didnt call me incessantly, and he got me the best deal possible. He was patient and understanding of my situation, and I would recommend him to anyone looking for a nice car. My only complaint I had to go back to sign paperwork the new finance guy didnt get me to sign, and just today  month after having bought my car the finance guy called me and asked me to sign another two pieces of paper. All in all, however, it was worth it. Im in love with my car, and the low price I paid for my car surely helps!"
1,"Ordered the Diamondback triple pizza, which was delicious. However, the awesome service was the thing that really stood out. Our server Brandon had a ton of tables, but somehow managed to provide better service than Ive seen in a long time."
1,"I have to flip a coin to decide between this place and Chakra , and even  Carrots down the road from Poms. They all are similar in options and prices, but I prefer  Carrots as they  vegan and a quite bit friendlier. Service can be hit or miss, and there is an older lady that growls at us sometimes  and I am not the only one that has imagined this. Shes been out the last several times I have visited, so Im happier about that. Yes, they are pricey, but in line with their competition. Parking can be a PITA during the weekend. Seems to appeal to the ladies brunch crowd, but the estrogen decor is not out of control."
1,"I know this place doesnt have authentic food. I know its not always the friendliest place. I know it looks weird, eating in the middle of a store. But for some reason their combination of a simple Dijon salad dressing and rice and always a decent slow cooked pulled chicken meal makes me enjoy solo lunches with a book. Once in a while you should skip the noisy, crowded, expected Pamelas and try something that tastes homemade."
1,"The food is surprisingly fresh and very very tasty!!  I got the beet salad, couscous with mushroom and truffle vinaigrette, and quinoa with mint and kale. The best I have had. Flavors are absolutely fresh!  The turkey sandwich was delicious as well!  Definitely going back!  A must for healthy eaters and those that want great taste without the bad stuff!!"
1,"Located in Bellagio Hotel Casino on The Las Vegas Strip. Are the drinks cheap? Nope. Will you have to wait in line to get in? You Better Believe It. However once in, this nightclub has one of the most breathtaking views of the Las Vegas Strip. A front row seat for the Fountains Of Bellagio Show. They also have scantly clad cocktail waitress and female bartenders. Thats for those of you who dont like breathtaking views of the Las Vegas Strip. Stop by one night, have a drink or three, and enjoy the view. Live it up, you are in Las Vegas for cryin out loud!"
1,"I think this could be the best bargain for quality hibachi food there is in Vegas! The staff is friendly and fun loving, the food is outstanding, the portions are great, and it is overall my favorite place for this type of dining!"
1,"Die neuerufffnete Mood Lounge im ehemaligen Kaktus ist eine wunderbare location, mitten im Wald im Norden von KA an einer schufnen mit einzelnen Kiefern bewachsenen Lichtung, bei den Sportpluetzen. Das interieur ist stylish, man kann drauudfen sitzen, soweit alles wunderbar.nAls ich dort war, war gut besucht. Leider hatte die Bedienung am Nachbartisch eine Fehlbuchung gemacht und war dann dermaudfen damit beschueftigt und etwas konfus, dass sie sich erst nach einer knappen halben Stunde in der Lage sah, mir die Karte an den Nachbartisch zu bringen. Ich war kurz davor, zu gehen.nNach  Minuten hatte ich dann einen Tequila Sunrise fufcr , EUR auf dem Tisch stehen. In einem Longdrinkglas. Die Zusammensetzung war wohl richtig, aber der Barkeeper verstand wohl kein Englisch und wusste deshalb auch nicht, was es mit dem Sunrise auf sich hat bzw. haben sollte. Oder er hatte zittrige Huende oder einfach keine Lust, sich die Mufche zu machen und den Grenadine zu unterschichten. Jedenfalls enthielt das Glas einige Eiswufcrfel die in einer einheitlich orangen Mischung schwammen. Nicht gut. nnAlso location  Sterne. Service und Cocktail leider nur  Stern."
1,"Very simply, gourmet burgers at above average prices.  It is a sports pub kind of set up so lots of TV all around to keep you distracted which isnt a bad thing if your blind date turns out to be a fuglie or a total tool.  nnThe selection of draft beers was kinda skimpy but, oh well, Ill just get my fix somewhere else.  It is Vegas after all so no shortage of booze anywhere."
1,"If I could add more stars for this review I would. Let me be brief. If you are in Vegas and you have a soul, go to Rollin Smoke and let them satisfy you. Their BBQ is possibly the best Ive ever had. The beef ribs are out of this world. Lord, the Jalapeufo cole slaw?!? and those cream corn poppers?!??...need I say more? Its a hidden gem just off the strip. Plenty of parking and seating inside. The service is great, everyone is friendly. Ive been three times now and the last time I decided to be a hero and take an order back to my family in LA. The waiters carefully packed my meal in a foil carrier and even added dessert as a bonus. Ive had the pleasure of meeting the chef and his wife, they are very passionate about their restaurant and you can taste it in the food. I LOVE THIS PLACE. YOU MUST VISIT....thank me later. I can no longer visit my grandparents in Vegas without stopping here...oh and maybe hitting a slot machine or two"
1,"Who goes hiking on vacation?  Apparently I do!  Several friends that live in the area are always posting pictures of their hiking adventures around the Phoenix area and I wanted to see what desert hiking was all about when I came down for Memorial Day.nnBeing from the Pacific Northwest, hiking generally involves parading through heavily forested trails with occasional rockery and is often made worthwhile with scenic waterfalls and lakes.  I knew not to expect this in Arizona, but what I didnt realize was the different beauty Camelback provided.  Being located in basically the heart of the widespread greater Phoenix area, the panoramic views are unparalleled without being in a plane.  PNW hiking is generally situated far away from any urban areas so it was unique to be able to see an entire city and its surroundings from a hiking vantage point.nnIn hindsight I wish I wouldve brought a map of the Phoenix area rather than looking at my small iPhone screen to get an idea of what I was looking at across the valley.  As a golfer it was fun to see the layouts of the courses Ive played from an aerial view, especially the Phoenician directly below on the south and east sides of the mountain.nnId love to come back for a sunset hike!"
1,I loved this place!Me and my husband popped in here for a drink on the rare opportune moment that we have a spare couple of hours without our son. The first impression is how full the walls are with bits and bobs but i actually loved that. It was very busy and did seem to have an average age of  of the people in there but that really wouldnt put me off going there again. The drinks arent too pricey and the staff were very polite.
1,"This is a small AJs, but really its the closest thing youre going to find in Central Phoenix to a specialty, gourmet market like Dean  DeLuca or another oldschool independent market. nnI wouldnt shop here for staples, but they have an excellent selection of items you cant find elsewhere, plus prepared food, wine, spirits, cheeses, etc.nnPlus, if I drank coffee this looks like a place I would want to sit out front and have a cup on a regular basis."
1,"I love family owned places like this. Okay, So Im not really crazy about pizza. If I do eat it, I prefer it to be a day old at room temp. We came across Uncle Joes while we were waiting for a band. Right outside of it all these people gave it a whole bunch of street cred. That was enough for me to try it. They had this deal  cheese pizzas for  dollars. I usually dont like cheese pizza, but this was something I gave my heart to. It wasnt even about the cheese, but the simple great taste and texture of the dough.nnI came here a second time and tried their wings with a Faygo root beer. The wings were good to me. I just like how everything is classic. Nothing over the top. If anyone knows about taste and quality.. Its Uncle Joe. nnIt sure is in the heart of Freemont street. I usually park at the El Cortez selfparking. Its free and plenty of space."
1,"Awesome hotel, beautiful suites  with bathrooms the size of a typical NYC hotel room, incredible pool deck, great staff, great service, excellent elevators, excellent housekeepingnnFront desk could use quite a few more clerks, and while they are very very nice, it would be helpful if they could be both nice and efficient, it took about  minutes for each check in.nnPool areas are fantastic, heated pools, nice lounge chairs, towels and chair covers, lots of bars they make a lotta  off those  cocktailsnnAs for all the complaints about badinferior rooms, remember you always get what you pay for...if you book the lowest category or lowest priced room when making your reservation and the hotel if full, it is inevetiable that not all of those rooms are going to have a fantastic view of the strip. You can assure yourself of this by paying the upgraded prices for the better view rooms, but if you are paying the cheapest price, or if you bought on priceline, then dont expect to get a room on the th floor with the great view!!nnCasino is very nice, and well lit. Yes, the perfume smell is very annoying at first, but after a while you really forget about it. but gosh darn they sure do pump the place up with it! Paybacks are very skimpy, but no more so than of the other big hotels. If you want good payback head to the riviera, sahara or downtown.nnGrazie club desk could also use more employees, very understaffed, but worth the wait none the less.nnOverall a great hotel, and kudos to the Venetian for being the largest Vegas property NOT owned by Harrahs or MGM. support the underdogs"
1,"Everything was amazing from our starters jalapeufo hummusnacho plate to our shared sampler plate wsmashed potatoes and potato salad. The manager stopped by our table and chatted with us for a bit which was a nice touch. Would love to have a place like this in SoCal to come to all the time! Oh yeah, and the Blue Moon cocktail with the blueberry moonshine on point!"
1,"These guys are great! I needed some flyers printed for my business already had everything in Microsoft Publisher, almost ready to go and I just needed someone to tell me a couple of little things before print  if the border would leak, if the size was standard or I needed to resize it and how much it would cost for  flyers. All those companies online were driving me crazy with design charges and no one could give me an exact quote for what I needed. After wasting a couple of weeks online, I got these guys flyer in the mail. nnI called them up, told them what I needed, emailed them my file, two hours later got a resized copy with a couple of minor things changed to fit the size better and two days later they delivered them right to my door! They didnt nickel and dime me for anything, were very pleasant to deal with and very fast and the flyers turned out great! From now on Ill do all my printing with them and not waste my time online and Id recommend them to anyone who needs any kind of printing done."
1,"I turned the corner and BAM I saw a huge chocolate fountain! So, I thought why not buy some sweets here??nnI had the crepes here and they were pretty amazing...I wish I had it them one more time before put I didnt have time.nnThe croissants here are so good too...I took some home with me I was pretty excited when I pulled them out for breakfast!!"
1,"Open for about three months, I didnt even know about Juans until I saw Mistis review and then my gal pals suggested it for dinner because it was close to Sweet Addictionhah!  See how I pick my friends?  Always thinking about the sugar!  Anyway, we had a solid meal here, going with the flaming fajitas, of course.  I got chicken and my pals shared a chicken and steak combo for two.  Both courses came out in a timely manner, with the flaming presentation for each, literally.  Its cool to see your food on fire.  I enjoyed my chicken fajitas and my pals rated the chicken better than the steak, too.  The chips and salsa were nothing special.  Service is attentive and friendly and the rest of the menu is quite extensive, but for my first visit I had to have the fajitas and not bad at all for ..  Ill come back to try something different next timenice to have an option for Mexican cuisine on this side of town, near Sweet Addiction AND Perfect Scoop ."
1,"Freds did my wedding, and I was so happy with how everything turned out. Renee talked to me about what I wanted, and I wasnt sure what flowers were what, and she was very helpful with everything. I only gave her a few specifics autumn colors and purples, green hydrangeas and red berries for texture and the flowers I didnt want, and she went right at it. The price for my bouquet, plus five bridesmaids bouquets, toss bouquet, two arbor pieces, and corsages and boutonnieres came out to be about average or lower from what I saw by getting estimates online. nnThey turned out awesome, and the woman who brought the flowers stayed to make sure everyones flowers were pinned and placed correctly. Renee also suggested that she bring some vases to have the bridesmaids place their flowers in, so that they could decorate the buffet and guestbook tables instead of getting separate pieces for those. A great idea, especially since that meant they didnt have to deal with the flowers after the ceremony.nnPictures of my bouquet a couple days after the event, you can see the flowers held up really well. sorry for cell phone quality httpslh.googleusercontent.comHjsyPxnXAUniUhUnQXIAAAAAAAACJwwHVsvABAowhnoIMG.jpg"
1,"Great food and service.nnAfter reading some reviews about Lees service, I was shocked because when I came in I had a pleasant experience. I had lunch here, with my brother and his friend. Our waitress was super attentive and made sure our waters were always filled. She even came by every so often to help us cook we didnt expect that at all. We are so used to the traditional KBBQ places where theres hardly any attention from the wait staff, but Lees was an exception. Their AYCE lunch is fairly priced at  something. Its also cleaner than Tofu Hut so Im definitely coming back."
1,"We decided to celebrate our first year anniversary here after getting a great coupon from restaurants.com and reading the other reviews here on yelp. having the menu with prices available online helped us a lot on deciding which coupon amount to get since there stipulations on it, for example pay  for a  gift certificate but spend a minimum of  not including alcohol  an  gratuity charge and this is the deal I got, although I think we should have gotten the  deal because there was only two of us. Their portions are pretty big. My husband had the ribeye, I had the rosemary veal, and for sides we shared the truffle fries, cream corn  Mac  cheese. With these orders plus drinks we did not even reach our required minimum of  yet. The sides were good for  people each order. We both did not finish our main entrees  we hardly made a dent in the sides. Overall the food was pretty good  the portions generous, but what really made this place worth it was the service, the atmosphere  just the experience of it! Our server daunte was awesome, he bent over backwards for us to accommodate our various requests. As what other yelpers wrote, they brought us a complimentary champagne toast and a happy anniversary dessert , the manager also personally came over and delivered a hand written happy anniversary card to us and her  the chef personally greeted us happy anniversary...the added personal touch was just the cherry on top! The staff here at envy really do know how to make you feel special. I did hint though that we were celebrating our anniversary wink, wink so if you are wanting to celebrate a special event, this place is top on my list, nice place, great food, reasonable princess, awesome service, what more could you ask for? I know there are some negative comments, but this is my advice to you, YOU are responsible for making YOUR experience positive or negative, it is all about attitude, do not let the pessimists sway your decisions, am glad I didnt."
1,"I realize we all have individual experiences, but I cant imagine all the bad reviews. I originally went off of a Groupon, which helped to make it an even better deal! I was greeted upon entering and given a tutorial of all they had to offer. I had purchased the Picnic Meal with lbs of meat,  large sides, a medium cobbler, cornbread,  an entire bottle of BBQ sauce!! Claimed to be a meal for , but fed  with a little left over. The meats were cooked well and focused on natural flavors. I cant really compare it with Rudys across the street because they use a lot of seasonings to alter their meats. I wont lie and claim it to be the best, but we had absolutely no complaints and shall definitely be coming back!"
1,"I came here a few weekends ago with a group of  girls for a decadent bachelorette party brunch! This was my second time at Max Brenner and I still cant get over how awesome this place is! You can smell the decadence as soon as you walk into the restaurant!!nnThe restaurant is smack in the middle of The Forum Shops in Cesars Palace. Its located across from the ginormous HM. Its a bit of a trek to get to the restaurants, but trust me its totally worth it!nnWe got a table upstairs right by the balcony as our group was fairly large. Our server was very attentive and sweet. For drinks, I got the dark chocolate mocha....sooooo amazingly good! Ive also had their regular dark hot chocolate before and it definitely doesnt disappoint. Whatever you order, definitely try something from the chocolate drinks menu! My favorite thing besides the delicious chocolatey drinks are the cute and clever cups that the drinks come in. I love their hug mugs as it is made for optimal drinkability and warmth! I even purchased one of the hug mugs so I can repeat the wonderful experience at home!nnFor food, I ordered the Illegal Chocolate Chocolate Chocolate pancakes. OMG!!! If you love chocolate and pancakes, this is the dish for you! The pancakes come with dark chocolate shavings, caramelized bananas, spiced pecans, and more melted white chocolate for drizzling! I was definitely in chocolate heaven after my first bite! I also tried my friends After Party Belgian Waffle. The strawberry honey and melted white chocolate that are on the waffle are to die for! I also highly recommend the Cinnamon Apple  White Chocolate Truffle Cream French Toast. nnIf you are not a chocolate or sweets person, dont worry, they got plenty of savory dishes to choose from as well. This place is a definite must try if you are in Vegas! Go! Dont miss out!"
1,"So, for our anniversary last week, my love told me to get dressed and that she had some surprises for me.  A surprise?? For me?! I thought to myself, Sweet! Actually it turned out to literally be sweet when she told me we were going truffle shopping. Scuse me?! We stopped in and I was overwhelmed by the awesomeness that was before me.  She told me to pick out whatever I wanted, and pick I did! I ordered  kahlua,  roasted raspberry,  rose,  chai which had edible shiny gold stuff on it!! and  salted caramel truffles.  Then we picked out two desserts, a tiramisu with a large white chocolate flower on top and a flourless chocolate cake.  They also had a great variety of cookies and other little desserts.  They had many other flavors and delights and I highly recommend this place if youre in the mood for greatness.  And I really dig the fact that its a local business.  The Bakers Daughter actually is the bakers daughter, btw.  This place shares a wall with Karls bakery owned by the truffle masters parents."
1,"Funny name.  We thought it was a joke, until we figured out what the place was. nnCreative, tasty food.  Duck tongue tacos....lobster...a chinese fusion.  A lot of stuff on the menu that Id like to try, but couldnt in  a short trip.nnSplendid flan for dessert...worth it right there.nnJose Andres is a masterful chef.nnLove the place.  Not cheap, but you wont mind....not for the culinary antiadventurous."
1,"YUM I loved Becketts Table. We were greeted by two friendly hosts, and chose to sit inside, but definitely plan on enjoying the weather on the patio next time. I was referred here by a friend who had went and raved about it.nnOur server was very helpful in recommending his favorites and helping me choose my dinner, the fire roasted green chile pork stew. Amazing! Definitely would order it again. We also split bacon cheddar biscuits which were very good.nnOverall I had a really enjoyable experience with both the service and the food and will absolutely be bringing friends back."
1,"Ive lived in the Paseos for a couple years and have walked past this park quite a few times but this past week I decided to explore it.   Its much larger then it appears from the street.  There is a playground, splash pad, basketball and sand volleyball courts.  There are plenty of benches and tables.  There is a large soccer field and the grass is beautiful.  And I know its a no, no, but early in the morning its hard to resist letting my Lab off leash so I can throw some balls.  From what I can tell the Moms and kids start arriving around  for the playground and splash pad portion."
1,"I had a few  friends come from NY for a week. Went to DW and this place did not dissapoint!nnIts hard to make a group of people all happy with their taste buds especially New Yorkers, but I have to say all of us were so impresed. Not one complaint the food is fresh and tasty. Even the pasta which I even doubted was superb. All of us ordered different dishes and all were GREAT!nnWe went to this place three times in one week! Twice in one day, for brunch and dinner!nnGoes to say that this place is awesome!!!!"
1,"I come from a long line of eaters. My grandparents sailed over for the sole purpose of the buffet. My dad won the pie eating contest in the  Hubby County Fair. Unfortunately I do not have any medals above my bed...YET. This is where I go to train.nnThere is a  dollar fee to train here, well worth it. First I start off with  reps of the king crab legs. Its a great warm up, gets the heart going and the fingers nimble. I follow this up with a few randoms, couple reps of sweet and sour chicken, bourbon chicken, and general tsos.nnAfter this I like to go for a cool down, or what I like to call, the first desert. Maybe some ice cream, banana cream pudding, something like that.nnI like to follow up my first desert with some mercury intake. Sushi does the trick. I dont go too crazy with this, like to keep my figure.nnThen I go big. The mongolian barbecue. This is where I build the stomach muscle. Steak, chicken, shrimp, scallops and I even saw shark here one time. nnAfter my stomach has stretched to new heights I like to finish off with my final cool down, some marshmallows run through the chocolate fountain.nnIs this the best training facility in the world? Probably not. Does it have some good crab legs and mongolian bbq? AbsolutelynnAlso, like other people said, dont leave too much food on your plate or they will charge you extra."
1,"Being a writer, every time I need inspiration for what I need to compose. Id go out and look for something to read that will get me more inspired and able to fill in the blanks of my story. Im lucky that Book Gallery is one of the place where can I found the stuff that suite my emptiness. There are lots of old books that are available in this shop."
1,This place is no joke. Food is prepared right in front of you and its all fresh ingredients.  Atmosphere is great and the employees are engaged to provide service. I had the classic combo with a side of garlic rosemary bred knots. Outstanding.  They even came around with fresh cut prosciutto to sample. Definitely recommend
1,"Theres no way you can go wrong with a GIGANTIC bowl of pho after a rough night out. So, go extra large or go home. nThat magical mixture of saltmsg, soup, and meat just tells your hangover to shut the fuck up.nnI feel like Im stealing food at their prices, so Im coming back no matter what.  nSadly though, the service was horrendous as it took  minutes for  bowls of pho to come out. And they got our appetizer order wrong. nBut yeah, brb next weekend."
1,"Not the best Ive had. Not the worst. I didnt east there so I cant comment on the service, but a far as take out goes, I ready liked that they gave me everything separate not just the basil and sprouts so I could divide it for leftovers.  pho is enough for  people. Price is what youd expect."
1,"I went on Monday night, it was fairly busy, but I was by myself so the hostess suggested sitting at the bar so I did. First off the bartender I forget his name, young cute guy was REALLY great. Super nice, and just sitting there watching him make drink after drink with ease, and answering everyones questions about the large beer selection. I was really impressed with the service. Especially considering how busy this place is and how new it is. They really have their act together.nnI ordered the Farm Burger and the truffle fries. The burger I have to say was just ok. I didnt like the meat, it was a little dry and had sort of a strange taste maybe the fancy wood its grilled on?, I ordered it medium.  Like I wish it was fattier or something... Then considering it had duck bacon and a fried egg and aioli on it all i could taste was the meat. I think I just prefer not grilled burgers to be honest. Or it could just be what I had...nnBut those fries were to die for!! Oh man I swear they must of shaved a whole block of cheese in them, and the truffle aioli was delicious. I cant recommend those highly enough. Ill definitely go back just to have those. I would like to try more burgers. I know burgers are finicky, it may be better next time!nnI didnt think the price was terrible. For those two things it was about  with tax and tip. You would share the fries if you had another person with you.nnOverall, check it out, I think you need to form your own opinion on this place."
1,"A group of friends and I went to this place on Saturday. Cover was  dollars, drinks were  dollars each, the DJ was descent and the staff made a goos effort to keep the atmosphere pumped up. Over all it was a good experience, as with every place like this there were some rowdy people, and as always it is good to ignoreget out of the way of such people. As others have commented there is a huge age spread in this place, from  year olds through , with the median age probably being  year olds."
1,"This is a smaller sized gym but it never feels packed to me. Its a great location for me since I live  min away. I always come during the evening rush between  and I never had to wait for any machines or felt like I didnt have enough space to do my workout. Ive been to bigger  hour gyms in the valley and this one is cleaner and newer looking than some others. The staff is young, but very friendly."
1,"My goodness, the lighting here is so dim you cant help but feel sleepy. But thats my only complaint  everything else was fantastic! nn Toshis Choice Omakasen Fried chicken Blue Ribbon stylen Oxtail fried ricen Bread pudding n Green tea crueme brulee nnIn addition to the above, we ordered a few rolls that I dont know the names of. All of the seafood was fresh, the fried chicken was perfectly salty and spicy, and the bread pudding was phenomenal. There wasnt one thing that I didnt like, and I do believe that warrants  stars! The staff was very kind and attentive, no complaints there. Their green tea is good. Its pricey but worth it, especially in Vegas."
1,"I have been coming to Alamo Car wash for many years. Even before the Walmart on Rainbow was ever built. With any businesses that stay open and successful it just proves that the price and service is one of the better ones in the valley. nnI remember one incident i had just gotten a large drink i took a turn fast and sharp and the drink goes spilling all over the passenger side. The first thing i do is drive myself over to Alamo for a good detailing and they do a fantastic job considering it only cost me  dollars every time i go. nnThey make a chore that would take me a few hours to do only take   minutes. The fact that they have several workers wiping and detailing every crevice of the car. Even the cup holder with all the miscellaneous build up they managed to take car of. I also noticed that they have a supervisor check the work before they call the owner over for pick up. By the way nice touch on referring to us by name. Great customer service. nnThey also have internet, TVs, massage chairs. practically all the conveniences that your home would have. It makes the waiting room feel like your living room and you dont feel like youre waiting at all. nnThey have many incentives such as refer a friend  and get a free wash and even a stamp card that i use."
1,"One of my friends from work introduced me to this random hole in the wall Chinese restaurant behind Fashion Show Mall, and I could not be happier! This is not a place to go to for ambiance. It is essentially attached to a dive bar, which can be accessed via a hallway that connects the two establishments. But it is definitely a diamond in the rough, no pun intended!nnI highly recommend going with a group so you can try as many dishes as possible. My favorites include the Baked Pork Chops in Chefs Sauce a musttry!, Spicy Salty Squid, Orange Beef, Singapore Noodles, and Pork Fried Rice. I have only tried their familystyle dishes and cannot speak to their lunch specials, but Im sure they are delicious as well.nnDiamond Chinese does not have many frills, but what it lacks in ambiance it more than makes up for with delicious food, huge portions and very low prices. Once you find it, youll visit again, I assure you!"
1,"I think the Perch may have the best fries Ive ever had.  I loved, The Egg salad as well.  Our server, Amy was great too.  I love the whole concept of the Container Park and Im so glad we chose to dine at The Perch.  Id definitely return next time Im in Vegas and I recommend it to others."
1,"Took my fiancuees car to the Octopus as little get well present from an untimely mirror vs garage accident.nnAt first you may feel some sticker shock when you see the prices however, you need to have an idea before you pull up if you want either a full service wash or the pricier fast detail service.  Dont worry, the friendly service advisors are not on the hustle. The staff is very honest and even handed me the iPhone I forgot on the seat as I got out of the car.nnThe Diamond Package is your best bet and unless you are have a real messy car, your sure to get a good, through wash.  The staff works endlessly from the time you pull into the wash bay to the time they help with the doors when you get back in to pullout into the street.  They even wipe down the dash and clean the insides of the windows.nnThe only thing I forgot to mention is that the Octopus is kid friendly for all ages myself included. Make sure to let the little ones blast the cars with the sudszilla as they roll  by but, dont be shy about taking a turn yourself"
1,"This place was suggested by a trusted friend...i wasnt disappointed in taste  quantity  quality, however I do think it was a little pricey.  Ill be back FOR SURE, but will spend a little less cash."
1,"Cupcakes and Alcohol coffee. I love like  things and these are on that list!!! FuManChu is the dopiest spot to meet up with friends to catch up over a cup of coffee and Cosy Rose cupcake. Stop a second. French press coffee cupcake with goat cheese frosting and port wine demi graze drizzle. Yeh  a cupcake. I know your mind is blown right now but stay with me. The cup cakes are made fresh daily so if the Cosy Rosy isnt there go for The Big O. Yeah I said that, and the name totally fits. Im going to be honest  I dont know whats in this one but it tastes just like the name. Do this as soon as possible. I never read the ingredients on this one because I ordered it on accident once and I loved it so much that when its in the case I get so excited I never read the description. Sorry not sorry. nnCome with a book, or a group, or your mom even. Hang out in the living room area. Listen to the dope music playing and admire the local art on the walls. Go home with a Tshirt or Tank  they are super soft. Take these treats to a dinner party, birthday or house warming. You will be the coolest kid in the room  for sure! nnSupport local!"
1,"I love love love love The Artisan Lounge!  Hands down the coolest environment that Ive found in Vegas, martinis are expensive but tasty Key Lime Pie is killer, neat looking pool.  Bathrooms are perfect for making out in lol.  They have a live Dj on certain nights, it is very small  intimate so when the Dj is there, its quite loud.nnValet only, no parking.  Which is probably a good thing since its in a less than desirable neighborhood, sharing the street with multiple strip clubs next to Treasures.  So at least you know your car will be wellwatched.nnA lot of locals think its a gay bar, its not, but certainly welcome the gay community nnI recently rented a basic room and honestly with as much as I love the lounge and atmosphere I was deeply disappointed with the room.  It had the same cool affect as the lobby but pictures and mirrors were hung on the wall crooked, the floor felt like it was caving in, it seemed like it had been throw together rather quickly  the front desk staff were dicks, they kept changing the incidental policydeposit on us. The gym is pathetic.  So the room experience wasnt that great.  As for the lounge....AWESOMENESSGONOW!"

1,"My love of dolphins and how close you get to be to them forces me to give this attraction  stars.  You will be within a few feet of the dolphins and the trainers do an excellent job keeping the crowd entertained while working with the dolphins.  I could sit by the pools and watch them all day long.  The pools are filled with crystal clear water and there are least  dolphins spread throughout the large pools.  nnOnce you finish up with the dolphins you can stroll down the path to see the white lion, tigers, panther, and cheetah roaming around.  If you love the zooaquarium experience, this is not to be missed!"
1,"NOTE  stars for a fast food place, not the Phoenician.nnThought this location deserved an updated review, in light of the current ones posted.  nnBeen twice to this location in the last week once eat in with my kids and once drive through.nnBoth time, our orders were accurate.  Everything was very fresh and seemingly prepared moments earlier taco shells crunchy, hot things hot, cold things cold.  Lettuce fresh and crisp, Mexican Pizza bubbling with heat.   nnThe staff on duty this Sunday afternoon were friendly and sharp.  while we ate our lunch, I noticed that on two separate occasions, someone came out to wipe tables and check trash.  No complaints here. nnI have a theory with the Frys Marketplace sharing the same parking lot recently remodeled, there is a huge draw of traffic to this location.  Perhaps the Taco Bell got their act together so as to not lose easy business.  No matter the  reason, they appear to have pulled it together nicely."
1,"We just visited Scottsdale for Baseball Spring Training and have nothing but good things to say about our stay. Staff was extremely friendly, hotel was clean newly remodeled?, a choice of pools and places to eat, able to get a rental car on site... nnWe booked on Priceline, so we didnt get a king room as requested, but nonetheless, the room was nice and I could use the second bed for my clothes  lol. We had a view of the golf course  ok. We hardly spent any time in the room, so no real complaint there. Had we, then maybe Id be a bit unhappy, but it gets busy and so  whatever. Shower was great  the shower head was fantastic and able to get a good temp without burning myself... Maybe I have a bad shower at home, but I took a nice long shower and enjoyed every second of it.nnWhen we got in, we immediately went to check out the pool. The main one was quite busy  a nice social scene. People with coolers for their drinks. A nice bar by the big pool to sit and socialize. We decided to Sangrias to get a bite to eat  something to drink  very good happy hour deals. We took a drink out to the pool, ending up at the round pool  maybe for kids?? Shallow. It was nearing the end of the day so it was nice and quiet. Only a few others were there. We fell asleep in the sun  a nice start to the weekend. nnThere are many nice restaurants just down Scottsdale Blvd., if you want to go out  which we did. Made a reservation for Flemings and took an U B E R ride down there... Cost us maybe  for uber x on the way there, but a bit more by the end of the night due to availability,  round trip... Definitely doable. nnThe next morning we got up and took a car to breakfast. Had I realized they had bikes for rent  I would have done this!! Oh well, next time. nnIt turned out we needed a car  we were going more places than anticipated. I for sure thought I would be stuck paying some overpriced rate due to our location  not able to get a car... Well lucky me, I found out that Hertz will let you book a car on their mobile site and bring it right to you. A concierge member will do the contract  etc. I also had to take this car back to the airport, and was able to with NO issue whatsoever. The valet guy was great at helping us get this all arranged, holding the car  bringing the car for us... The daily rate was only ... nnI should say that the staff is very friendly  constantly attending to you if needed not too pushy  obnoxious, but if you look like you need help  theyll ask. Also, having drinks with my friend at the Sangrias, I returned to my room when we were done. Only to realize after that I had left an entire bag of my belongings including my phone  hello!!. I immediately did find my iphone on my ipad and ran down to the bar. Freaking out asked if someone had turned in a phone, the waitress said no  so I frantically ran outside  looked where we were sitting. A very nice gentleman followed me and asked to look at the find my iphone  looking to see where the phone was... He helped me look for a bit and then checked with security  someone had turned in my entire bag. HELLO. nnVery nice stay overall... I would definitely go back here next time we are in town. Has a lot of amenities and everything in one place. A work conference would be nice here... Maybe not as lux for some when they think vacation... But I enjoyed obviously."
1,"I love country music therefor i loove this place. Ive been here two times and both times the live bands have been wonderful playing country as well as classic rock. very fun the dance on the dance floor. The bartenders are really into it and make drinking even more fun. I have never had the food here but id expect nothing too exciting just bar food. but if youre looking for a fun place to dance, not have to dress up too much and have a good time with fun people i would try this place!"
1,I read the term complex tasting broth in a review for another ramen place and I never got the term till I tried the tonkotsu shoyu ramen here. Best ramen ever! The fried rice is pretty good to but the gyoza is nothing to rave about.
1,"I never thought I could appreciate vegan food, but after trying Fresh Mama, I have to say I was shocked at how tasty it was. I ordered the Verdi Florentine and it was delicious! Though the food rocked my socks, the front counter ladies could use a course on customer service. It was off putting, however one of the cooks brought out another wrap for my friend who had dropped hers and he was so incredibly friendly it made up for the cashiers. Fresh Mama is amazing and I will be back, I just hope that they push friendliness a bit more."
1,"Great classy sports bar with lots of TVs, good food, and long list of beers on draft. I came here on a Monday night to watch the Cardinals game and the layout was great every direction I looked there was a giant TV there. The only downfall was the wait staff they took forever to bring out drinks and food thats the only reason for the lower rating."
1,"A little outside the Strip, but one should definitely come here for breakfast.Food is amazing, service is excellent!!! We had the Spanish omelet n pancakes..pancakes are one of the best I have had...n the staff never lets your coffee cup go empty...a really good place in all!!!"
1,"My sister flew in from St. Louis just in time for lunch.  We arrived at DW Bistro around . pm and the restaurant was full.  Luckily, a table for two opened up.  The decor is light, airy and modern. nWe started with a refreshing carafe of St Germaine elderflower, sparkling wine and club soda.  Perfection!  We each had the DW signature salad.  The combination of the greens, candied nuts and goat cheese form a perfect union topped off with a delicious vinaigrette.  Upon recommendation from our awesome server, we split the jerk chicken sandwich.  They had me at jalapeno bacon  YUM!  Full from our delicious meal, we took a slice of their carrot cake to go.  OMG  the best!  The cake was light and super moist with bits of ginger.  The cream cheese icing was covered in beautiful white chocolate shavings.  nSo happy that our sisters week in Vegas began at DW Bistro!np.s. the Jamaican ginger candy that came with the bill is AWESOME"
1,"The best way to describe my experience at Texas de Brazil can be summarized in two wordsnnMEAT DIMSUMnnUpon the suggestion of one of my friends who has been here before he cautioned us not to fill up on the stuff at the salad bar rather start with the meat first.  Once we flipped our little indicator sign to Green all the meat carvers came to our table shout out what kind of meat they had.  My favorite were the Brazilian garlic roasted sirloin and the lamb shanks.  Both ere super tender and very flavorful.  There was so much variety that I cant even remember what I ate but I do remember that it was damn good.  nnAbout  minutes later, we were all stuffed.  The waitress was super friendly and very helpful in locating any meat we had desired.  If you are on the Atkins diet this is the place to go.  I highly suggest not eating lunch before you come because theres that many different cuts of meat that you can try.nnDefinitely will be back!"
1,"Good cheese. Good wine. Friendly service. Comfortable seating. Good stuff that goes on a cheese plate but is not cheese fruits, nuts, crackers, breads, etc.. They even have a TV with the game on, which is both good and bad. It distracts from the cozy wine bar atmosphere, but I do like to know who wins the FloridaOklahoma game. Either way, it is one of the more comfortable spots in the northwest part of the city."
1,"This place is wonderful, andin my opinionputs so many things I love about Pittsburgh into one tiny location. The ethnic pride. The chaos. The friendliness. The great food.nnIm half Polish, though I didnt really grow up eating too much Polish food or, at least, too much authentic Polish food. My wife and I stopped at a killer, realdeal Polish restaurant in Montreal a few years ago, though, and that started my quest for amazing Polish food. Which quickly led us to SD in the Strip. nnIts a pretty narrow place, and it always seems packed even on weekdays. The space is pretty evenly divided between retail, deli, and a small dining space. You can order food and eat it, and boy is it good. Ive tried about four different dishes there, all incredible. Personal recommendation the pork stew on dumplings is tops. My mouth is watering just thinking about it! This is all authentic stuff, folks, and, the folks in the tiny kitchen whip it up quickly. Theres limited space to eat, though, and even then the tables are wobbly and kind of gross. This might be the only qualm I have with the place, and its really a minor one.nnTherere a lot of Polish and Eastern European household goods jammed into the back of the shop, tooeverything from teas to pottery to chocolate to frozen pierogi. Lots of kitschy Kiss Me, Im Polishstyle shirts adorn the walls, of course, but they also have some lovely glassware and the like. Some of the imported goods are wonderful, too. I picked up a box of Herbapol mint tea once on a whim and now Ill never touch drink anything else.nnThe good folks thereall family, I thinkare super friendly, switch back and forth between English and Polish for effect. Theres always a huge link snaking past the deli meat and cheese display, and customers are always so goodnatured. I love it, and I love this place. Hope you will too!"
1,"I really like the food here! The beer is decent, and the atmosphere is fun. Ambient lighting inside, some seating outside although Ive never eaten outside. Burgers are good, I like the Southwest Burger the best, nice combo of sweet and somewhat spicy. For appetizers, dont skip the spanakopita. Its delicious!"
1,"Love their salad bar, so much to eat, not as much as sweet tomatoes but good nevertheless! Only suggestion would b if they can get the labels on foods, bcs for people like me who dont eat meat its very difficult to figure out that theres tuna in one of their salads without a label! I almost ate it, so I hope they take this into account! My best is the whole boiled eggs though"
1,"The review is for the nightlife there. I love that you can take the monorail from hotel to hotel.nnAlso, we went to the Cat House and my friend and I got in free and got free drinks till midnight. We went on a Wednesday for Wonderland Wednesdays. Get your drinks from the male bartenders because the girls give very little!"
1,This place is so fancy!! Ive only been in the casino part and its really nice. Their parking is easy and they have the best club in town XS. They also have many nice smaller bars which are great for hanging out and just relaxing.
1,"Dear Las Vegas,nnOur first encounter was nothing short of fabulous.  I won almost  off of a penny slot machine in NY NY.  My girlfriends and I were upgraded to the penthouse suite for absolutely no reason besides the receptionist being nice.  No one in my party lost anything, was arrested, hospitalized, got pregnant or married.  I would say overall this was a very successful trip.  It began with drunken shenanigans on our flight which landed at PM Friday night and ended with a terrible hangover and blisters on top of blisters on Monday afternoon.  nnIll be back, friend.  It was nice to meet you."
1,"Small and cozy, this place has a great comfortable atmosphere, excellent service and all of the food just matches as well.  Fried shrimp PoBoy, roast beef debris as well, Gumbo is fantastic, bananna pudding like my mom made, and of course Lola herself to round it out.  GO THERE you wont regret it!"
1,"You come across a place called KoMex fusion....Dazed? Confused? Mystified? Let me clear this up for you, KoMex fusion is Korean, Mexican, Chinese and American food all smashed together. Not clear enough? Well, then it is what everyone says it is, freakin awesome. Its quite a trek from the strip, so be prepared to hop on the freeway, but trust me, you will save much more money on food so the extra gas will be more than paid for. My family of four tried many different dishes, we all ordered drinks and our bill was . Im not even joking. The problems with KoMex is that it is not in the best area and it is super small. There is often a line out the door. I suggest you go at off times, try everything and tip heavy they work their butts off here."
1,"Edited nnNew reviewnnWent back for some gogi, yup.  star. DnnOld reviewnnAny new Korean restaurant in the valley is welcome and always a good sign of the growing community!nnMy gf and I got there a little later than our usual dinner time, but was glad that they were open until pm which is always good. Ive noticed a trend that the Korean restaurants in the west valley are generally open until pm or even later, while the east valley restaurants close no later than pm. nnThe first thing I noticed was the classy decor of the restaurant, but was a little perplexed of the nogrill in the table. Perhaps they bring out a miniburner like Hodori? With the restaurant named meat I would assume that is their specialty, but I will save that for another visit as I did not see any people with the burner  please keep in mind it was pm so I wasnt expecting the restaurant to be packed.nnAnyways, I ordered the maeuntang spicy fish stew and my gf ordered the kimchi tofu soup. The side dishes came out very quickly and we were served kimchi, radish kimchi, pickled radish slices, bean sprouts, spinach, and fish cake stir fry. The radish kimchi was a little bland for my liking but the rest were pretty good.nnThe tofu soup was the first dish to make it out  while it had decent flavor, it didnt really compare to some of the tofuspecialty restaurants in the valley  but thats okay, we really didnt expect blow my mind tofu soup since the restaurants name was Gogi meat. My spicy fish stew came out not long afterwards and was served in a traditional shallow and wide pot. Glad I ordered that  it was pretty delicious. The whitefish was nice and soft and had all of the fixings that it should have had.nnService was pretty good overall Id definitely like to come back and try the meat dishes!"
1,"This is currently my favorite sushi place ever! I have been here a few times since I live out of town, but I make an effort to eat here every time Im in the area! nnOMG rollnMy absolute favorite. This arrives to your table wrapped in tinfoil and set on fire. The waiter or waitress unwraps the tinfoil, setting the fire out. The small fire adds a hint of a smokiness, like a light barbecue. I love this roll, and I think its a steal at ! This type of specialty roll would usually be pricier at other places. One roll is enough to fill me up!nnH rollnThis is also a delicious roll and priced the same as the OMG roll . This was definitely spicier than the OMG roll, so if youre looking for something spicy, this is your roll. While this roll was also good, I prefer the OMG roll because of that delicious smoky flavor.nnServicenWe have always had friendly, attentive waiters. During one visit, Juno treated us to some complimentary green tea mochi ice cream! Last time, we got free miso soup  edamame from the checkin offer, two free pieces of eel, and free ice cream!"
1,"This bar has breathtaking views of Las Vegas. My husband and I stopped here after I nearly died from a heart attack after being talked into going on the big shot. The bartender was completely inundated with large groups of people coming in at once,  but handled it well. The drinks were tasty and the views incomparable, what else do you need?"
1,"La Perla is definitely a safe bet when your in that area. Great salsa and consistent entrees. Oddly I have never tried a margarita there so I cant advise on that. Its a little shabby on the inside but so what, who cares? Thats what I expect from a great mexican restaurant."
1,"This place is incredible!  The line seems neverending, but its well worth the wait.  Their price is really decent, considering I went to Caesars and Wynns buffet for almost the same price and was disappointed in how limited their options were.nnWhen I first got to Rios buffet, I was so confused on where I should first go.  They have dishes from all over the world like all the other casino buffets but the difference is that Rios is gargantuan in space and has an incredibly vexing amount of selections.  Even if I took a very minute morsel from each station, it just wouldnt have been possible to try everything.  A person really has to pick and choose what they want to eat beforehand, because this place will make you dizzy with food.nnTheir dessert selection is just as copious.  It was almost frustrating to try and pick one or two because my stomach couldnt ingest anymore!  I have never been in a place with so many options I feel like I have to come here at least ten times to get the taste of everything.  nnAll in all, the food is delicious and well worth the money."
1,"I have been here on several occasions and really like it. It is a small and intimate place with wonderful servers, great food, and a nice wine list.  It is a bit odd that this nice resturant is tucked away in a corporate park rather than being in a center with a mix of retail and restaurants, but it works nonetheless. nnI love the Shrimp Ooo La La!!! which is flash fried  tossed in a sweet  sour Papaya vinaigrette. And, we also love the Diver Scallops as well as the Sea Bass. Since we both love Crueme Brulee, we usually go for the Trio of Crueme Brulee   delish!! nnThe restaurant is a little pricey but worth the splurge. Also, we have been when they have participated in Restaurant Week  or  when they have offered fixed price specials.  This is a nice way to try Global for the first time, because you get a choice of selected appetizers, entrees, and desserts for a fixed price."
1,"Yep, I see the reviewer before me used the phrase hidden gem. Im a little pissed, since thats the phrase I wanted to use. We went to eat here with friends last night, and I was impressed by the food, the service, and the environment for somewhere that looked like such a holeinthewall. nnI ordered the Szechuan Eggplant, and it was really good. There was plenty on the plate, too, so I took leftovers to work today for lunch. The couple who took us there wanted the spicy green beans, and although the restaurant had sold out of green beans, the manager went to the Harris Teeter around the corner to grab some for us. Even with the little hiccup, the food was ready quick, and it was all delicious.nnMy only complaint is that the vegetarian selection is a little skimpy...there were  or  things on the menu, which isnt bad, but usually a Chinese restaurant will have lots of options."
1,"Nicer than your average PTs as far as ambiance is concerned, its about the same as a Sierra Gold. Friendly, but aloof service, the waitress seemed to disappear for long periods of time . Good happy hour menu. I bought a regular martini here and it was pretty good and well executed, which I am glad for because it would kind of suck if their martinis were bad. This place had a pretty chill atmosphere."
1,"Charming little place  if slightly odd staff! Its an old cellar and has a great feel to it, looks small, feels small but actually has about  covers.nnThey have it has to be said a great wee wine list very reasonably priced  nice cote du rhone for less that ua! You wont get that in many places in Edinburgh.nnFor the meal I went for the Duck speciality  seared duck served on pak choi in a soy sauce served with jasmin rice. Great flavour  nice pink duck  fantastic meal for a Wednesday evening!!nn main meals   side dishes and a bottle of win for ua is a massive winner in my book!!nnHighly recommend for a munch!! Happy JD!!!"
1,"Our new favorite local sushi, great quality dish and a great chef in a very casual setting, and their own unique wasabi sauce that is just delicious. The rolls are usually not my thing but I took a chance and was really pleased, superstar roll was off the hook! Highly recommended, youd never stop in there if you didnt know what it was, very small strip plaza, but if your reading reviews on Yelp and your nearby, go here!!!!"
1,"Went with a friend early on a Sat. pm for dinner.  Im glad we went a little early because the place filled up fast.nnWait staffservice  Welcomed by a staff member actually opening the door for me nice touch.  Promptly seated.  Our waitress was very knowledgeable of the wine list and menu.  The waitress was also perfect in her timing...checked in enough to make sure we were happy, but not too much as to make you feel rushed.nnFoodDrinks  My friend had the house Pinot Grigio and I had a Negroni Nuovo these things could be dangerous...a great drink for a summer day.  We split Antipasti bread  cheese...this was yummy, although the name could be improved and Insalate Italian...also a boring menu name, but was tasty as well.  We both had pasta for our main course...Tagliatelle and Ricotta Gnocchi.  Both of us thought the pasta was delicious...perfectly cooked and very flavorful.nnDessert  We split the Salted Carmel Budino.  It was so good, I almost ordered one to go.  Rich as Budino should be, but light enough so as not to put you in an after dinner coma.nnPrice  If you want to try the traditional multicourse Italian meal, the prices can add up.  Our meal for  came to  including  drink each and the tip.  For a casual dining atmosphere, some may consider this too pricey.nnOther comments  I read other comments about a problem with flies.  This must have been overcome, because we didnt notice any.  This is a restaurant I will visit again to sample some of the other menu items."
1,"When flying in to Madison or just passing on the way somewhere in Madison I have wanted to try Ale Asylum.nnSo last evening our family who live here are making me dizzy discussing the crazy traffic and the Friday Fish Fry madness both on the roads and in the cafes quite breathlessly I must say when I whisper how about ale asylum...really softly under my breath...nnClose to the house, no Fish Fry panicked early arrival needed, and a simple menu while sitting outdoors. Boom. Im golden.nnI had the Mad City Nutbrown and a Pantheon. Very nice! Our Madisonites order and swill so fast I have no idea what they drank. Oh well. They must fortify for summer before the beer pipes freeze and they are stuck with wine club deliveries for  months I guess. I have no idea being from the West Coast.nnThe meat pizza and the special Hawaiian with horseradish mustard sauce were pretty nice.nnService was attentive and I liked the friendly nature of the place.nnThis place must be something special for they have their own zippy important looking driveway en route to the airport a little tricky to leave but easy to get in.nnBig parking lot sufficient to be able to skirt the beer stunned Madisonians wandering out clueless into the cars...nnPrices are reasonable once again you can take a bazillion Madisonites out to brunch or lunch or drinks or dinner for under  when the same services in LA would run you ....nnSecret for LA folks flying out here plus fooddrink bills is so economical dont let your Madisonians travel to LA promise you will meet them here and you can still afford to eat.  Just keep emphasizing that this lovely city has all one could ever need and it should work.nnNo seriously my husband still tells the story from  of a Madison bar tab we had of just . for drinks for  people and he gesticulates and his eyes bug out.nI love Madison when not sleeping in my boots under a dog or two."
1,"Dr. Insera and his staff have been a light at the end of a dark tunnel. If anyone knows what neck and migraine pain are then youll know what I mean. I have been going to see dr. Jason since . My migraines are induced by physical activity in the cervical region. I have a very physical career and I dont wait for anyones help when it comes to getting it done. Many moms know what I mean. So because of my life and career, I have suffered. nI know that for a fact, that without dr. Jason and his ability to manipulate my body back to the correct positions, I might have not been able to deal with the pain through the years. Dr. Sean is a new addition to the Ideal family and we have all been adjusted by him, he is a great listener and honestly wants to know exactly where it hurts and how can he make it better. Both of the docs are very friendly and the staff are super nice. Jerry has always been very helpful in squeezing me in when I cant take the pain anymore. They take most insurance and the cash pay prices are really accommodating. Easy access location and in the same space since opening day."
1,"Hooray for yelp!  I would never have never found this restaurant without the awesome recommendations of my fellow yelpers.nnThe decor is chicelegant and sports a very nice full service bar.  nnThe mussels were nothing short of spectacular with a delicious currycoconut sauce that was reminiscent of a delicious Tom Kha Kai Soup. You will want to drink it when the mussels are gone... trust me.nnThe Moroccan Spiced Chicken Confit was also amazing.  The dish is served in a miniature Tagine and the tender and delicious chicken with a wonderfully crispy skin is served on top of a delicious bed of chick peas, apricots, and candied lemon zest. nnI cant wait to get back to Charlotte to try some of the other dishes here!"
1,"My sister and I come here a few times a week if not more. I will have to say that mostly the only reason i keep coming is for one of the workers here .. Mercedes ALWAYS makes my drink PERFECT. If  not for her, none of the other girls make my caramel machiatto right at all. But Mercedes is so very friendly, she remembered my name from the getgo and not too long after memorized my drink which is pretty detailed and specific This Starbucks is always packed good for them. There are a few workers here who are not friendly at all and really need to take a few customer service classes but i have found this is the came with most Starbucks. But this is definitely my favorite Starbucks"
1,"in vegas working for CES and broke a nail in the middle of the day. didnt have time to fix until after my event, which was pm. thank god this place was open because i could not have gone longer with this poor looking nail. i have long pointy cat claws and the lady shaped it perfectly to match the others, it looks even better than the other ones. she was also really quick and it was only  dollars to fix the nail. i dont think they are actually open , they closed at midnight when i went."
1,"Hidden Gem of a restaurant!!! nnI came to dinner not expecting much because the restaurant is located within the lobby of the Days Inn. I was hungry and just wanted someplace to eat. nnWhen I call this place a hidden gem, I am referring to not being able to find this place unless I was looking for it! This traditional Italian restaurant has the best pizza I have ever eaten. and has been voted The Best of Phoenix seven times. The richness and texture of the crust make this pizza to die for. nnPleased with my dinner, I came back for a fettuccine Alfredo with shrimp dinner in an attempt to truly gauge the authenticity of the Italian food. The Alfredo sauce was rich, thick, and full of flavor. The possibility of adding vegetables I am a vegetarian made the choices plentiful. One can choose from shrimp, vegetable, and chicken as toppings. nnThe flat screens allowed me to enjoy the baseball game while enjoying  beer. The bar area allows for friendly, quiet conversation or just a getaway from trendy and crowded bars. The friendliness and prompt service provided a world class style of service. I felt pampered and catered and not hurried to decide on what to have for dinner. nnIf you live in Phoenix, or happen to be in Phoenix, go eat at Raimondos!!!!"
1,"Visiting the area I was so pleased to find this spot. Not only was my hair fantastic, I able to book an appointment online on the same day. I was treated upon arrival to delicious infused water, fresh coffee and chocolates. Cute, clean and efficient this spot even gives you a complimentary umbrella so you can preserve your doo on the way to your car."
1,"A view of the water works at the Bellagio hotel alone is reason enough to dine here. However, the dining experience is first rate. As a wine addict I was impressed by the depth and diversity of Picassos wine list. The sommeliers are knowledgeable  including a Master Sommelier and they make good recommendations. I had the tasting menu quail salad, red shrimp with shashito pepper juice, and lamb chops. The cooking was superb and the presentation of dishes was very creative. The menu changes daily."
1,"I am what some may consider a froyo connoisseur. This is one of my new favorites. The toppings are pretty standard but they have tasty and unique flavors. New favorites are Nilla Wafer, Kona Coffee Blend, and Key Lime Bars. YUMMM! Its never too crowded and is always clean and toppings are always well stocked. Yogurtland is definitely worth a try the next time youre looking for a cool treat!"
1,"I am such a sucker for this place.  Dont let my checkin count fool you  I used to be here at least once a week, usually more.  I just didnt have the Yelp app shame on me.nnOld Navy, HM, Sephora, Juicy Couture, MAC, Victorias Secret, Teavana... oh man, the reasons to hang out at this place for hours at a time.nnYardhouse is a great little spot to eat and drink, the movie theater is now owned by AMC I believe I hated Rave, so this is a huge bonus, Kabuki serves up some stellar sushi and there is even a little boba tea place tucked away by the bridge in the middle.nnThe atmosphere here is always happy and energetic, so sometimes I just like to walk around aimlessly and soak that in.  Coffee Bean  Tea Leaf can assist in your caffeinated fix to do so, too!nnThey hold several events here throughout the year Ive been to a few and they really give a sense of community.nnI almost always make my outoftown friends come here because damnit, its awesome.nnTalking about it makes me want to go...but I certainly know better to NOT go on Christmas Eve...ha!"
1,"Brunch time!  My wife and I were definitely a fan of the Square Cafe.  This review has been a long time coming since I almost forgot I had eaten here.  FOR SHAME!nWe really enjoyed sitting outside on the sidewalk in the cozy little neighborhood of Regent Square while sipping Squares quality coffee and having a nice brunch.  The service was great and friendly and our food was almost very very good.  I had the Square Protein breakfast with eggs that were oozing that yolky goodness.  And my better half had an omelete with spinach and feta, she didnt speak much during the meal, so thats a plus.  LOL.  nI would highly recommend spending a nice late morningearly afternoon meal outside of Square.nI also heard they have tons of vegan and vegetarian options, but why?!"
1,"The only bad thing about this place really, their always so freaking busy, but because they are so freaking good! So what I was thinking...call in the order and bring it home  They have the BEST Mexican Food.  I recommend their Cahuamanta  Birria or Cabesa.  This is a MUST try!"
1,"After reading the reviews I cant wait to try it. Its my first time, the employees were very helpful and courteous. The place is clean.... Im very impressed with the Steak  Cheese and will definitely et it again. My husband had the Thai Chili Pork, he said it was satisfactory"
1,"I have been a customer of this location for some time and the food has always been great. The thing I want to mention here is how they handle things when something is wrong. Recently I went through the drive through and ordered two steaknTostada salads, my moms favorite,  when I got home I discovered that they had been made as chicken tostada salads, I called back and spoke with the Manager,Francisco, and he was very apologetic and took my name and told me to stop in whenever I wanted and he would buy my mother and I replacement salads at no charge.  A week went by and I went in and could not get over how pleasant The manager was and how he really cared that a mistake had been made and that he wanted to correct it.  this place is great and they really do care that their customers are Happy, something i think is valuable in this modern world.  I will continue to go here knowing that if a mistake is made i will be taken care of by a staff that makes me feel like I matter."
1,"By far my favorite book store in Phoenix.nnEvery time I go in there I never leave without a book or two.  Their selection is constantly changing, and all of the books are in good shape and come at a great price most are under .  They also have a large selection of DVDs and other misc items.  The staff is always friendly and helped me out by special ordering the GRE Princeton Review  book.  nnThe inside is charming, and is literally covered floor to ceiling in books.  Youre sure to find something in there to meet your interests."
1,"My first Vegas show and I thought it wasnt bad. Its got a good mix of old school and current music. Though this night we didnt get Lady Gaga. That would have been nice. nnThe show started out with Sister Act as Whoopi Goldberg was singing. The nuns...are guys, but whatever. It wasnt bad at all though I think Whoopi is a little bigger.nnThe most disapointing of the show I thought, and many might not agree with me was the Michael Jackson one. The singing wasnt up to par but the dancing was great. He does a better little Michael than a grown up Michael. nnI thought the guy who played Bobby Darin was good. He was strong. I had no idea Bobby Darin was the singer that sang Splish Splash. For some reason I was thinking Chubby Checker. In fact I think he was the star of the entire show.nnElvis show wasnt to shabby at all. I was really hoping he sing Viva Las Vegas. So when his set finished and he didnt sing it I was so disapointed that I was going to rate this lower, but at the end he did sing it while they were doing the credits portion of the concert, so I was not disapointed.nnWe sat in the back, but for what we paid it was alright. No wait staff to get your drink."
1,"This place has a great selection of tools and supplies. Most of which I dont even know. The best thing about this place is the service. Both times I have been here, the staff was very knowledgeable and took the time to explain what I needed. They also provide woodworking classes which I am planning on taking when I find the time. I have said it a million times and will continue Customer service is where its at. I am so willing to pay more for a product when it comes with great service and support."
1,"Wings are the thing here!!  Yes, they also sell strips which are always tender and fresh. We get them occasionally.  Or a mix of the wings and strips.  But the wings are our favorites.  We order them extra crispy and prefer the hot, garlic parmesan sauces.  Flipn hot is also good but a bit too much heat for the others in my family.  We like pretty much all the flavors but tend to stay with hot and garlic parm, and occasionally honey barbecue as well.  nnFries are top notch and there are always plenty!!  Their bread is made fresh daily and you can tell.  Soft, buttery and a hint of garlic.  Its the perfect complement to the wings!!  nnThey always greet us with a smile and make sure we have everything we need whether we are dining in or taking home."
1,"Im hesitant to write a review on Bianco because no matter what I say, im going to sound like a broken record.  I mean, what can i possibly say that hasnt already been said a million times.  Yes, you have to wait a long time to get seated, and just when you think its your turn, you wait some more.  Yes, the pizza is amazing, especially that crust.  Yes, Chris is a genius working that oven.  I almost want to give this place  stars because its in Phoenix and not in LA.  Why?????????????"
1,"Small but quirky place has lots of character and good pizza. nThe interior is tiny but cozy, and the bar area is nice.nnWe sat outside, and while the patio is fairly spacious, it is quite close to the road and intersection.nWhile we were outside, seven police cruisers stormed by, sirens wailing.nKind of indicative of an area that is still in transition maybe.nnThe pizza and beer were good, and the service was friendly and prompt.nnI would definitely visit again."
1,"Great Service, we were offered water as soon as we got to the hotel. Such a nice touch. Modern decor, very nice hotel for the price. Beds were comfortable, rooms were very nice. Pool was great especially for the weather. Breakfast was good, came with bacon, sausage, eggs, waffles, cereal, etc. buffet style Overall I would definitely reccomend this hotel to anyone. Everything went smoothly."
1,"A very cute breakfast  spot that has something for everyone. You may have to wait a little to get seated but its worth it. Ive had their regular  eggs and meat breakfast  which comes with yummy fresh baguette bread if you want. This morning I chose the chocobanana crepes where simply delicious and are available in half portions for those who have smaller appetites. All the servers are nice but it took a long time to get our bill, although we didnt mind having some extra time to chat."
1,Have been getting my hair color and highlights done by Marinella for over a year. I always get compliments on it. I dont cut my hair often but when I do I get compliments on that too. My hair looks healthy now. She also takes care of my hair. Crazy I know but whatever it is its working. My family  friends go to her now.
1,"Stayed here over the Fourth of July weekend and although very busy, the staff did a fantastic job of making us feel welcome and special. We stayed in a corner casita that overlooked the pond, very romantic at night. They did forget our champagne that was preordered to be waiting in our room upon arrival it was meant to be a surprise for me...oops but they came about half an hour later tondeliver this once we called. They gave us a birthday card instead of an anniversary card but we decided to laugh it off. Everything was too wonderful to be upset about something so small. They threw in some chocolate covered strawberries too which was a nice touch!  There was entertainment each night we were there, an Independence Day air show in the early evening, live music, and fireworks later in the night. The restaurants on property are great too. I gave Bourbon Steak a separate review on yelp. We loved the pool minus all the screaming kiddos and the drinks and food. We think her name was Vivian, the girl who served us at the pool area...she was very attentive and just great to us! We bumped into her working a separate bar area later that night and she was just as energetic and prompt. We really, really appreciated the wonderful service from ALL of the staff members but especially that from Vivian. Thank you, Fairmont Princess for a magical weekend staycation! We plan to come back!"
1,"This hotel smells bomb... Everywhere. The Palazzo is absolutely beautiful all around. There are so many reviews about this place i dont even have to say everything I need to say.. but we did have  wonderful service here and they have good food!nWe had a great time nThe Chinese New Year tiger was humongo and almost looked real!nnI also forgot to add that we stayed in the Bella suite, which accomodated me and my four lovely ladies. The couch is big with a pull out bed. There is a vanity as well as a double sink with a lot of lighting and mirrors. nPalazzo has ALOT of restaurants to choose from so if you are staying here i suggest you definitely try out one of the Mario Batali restaurants,  and check out the shops.. one word ZARA."
1,"My husband just finished watching some history special on Frank Lloyd Wright before making the visit to Arizona. Once we heard that there was a museum, we had to visit. nnThe price per ticket is  for a minute tour. Its a bit pricey! Its not a typical museum it is a working architectural school. You go on a guided tour in a large group that starts approximately at the top of the hour or so. The tour guide was entertaining, smart, and a previous student. It was a fantastic learning experience! nnIf you are looking for something to do and you have the money to spend, you should make a visit here. Its not a place I would visit again, but it is worth going once. We were impressed!"
1,"Now, Ive made the mistake of reviewing before completion of services See Showcase Honda, but, like my dogs, I just dont learn and am a big fat smooshy dumb head face who chewed up mommys expensive shoes this morning and drives mommy CRAAZY.nnAnyway.nnHere it is Yeah, the salesgirl who helped me out was a big time Valley Girl and her name was Chanel and her makeup was quite possibly airbrushed, but she was really freaking cool.nnShe understood and commiserated with me on the following topicsnnbeing miserably and uncomfortably blindnthe overthetop prices of these silly designersnhaving to work weekendsnthe silliness of our respective boyfriends not getting that we have to SEE, dammit, as in the necessity of rent pales in comparison to the obvious importance of me being able to accurately but silently judge those around me based on how I can SEE their personal appearancennSo, that said, the place is overpriced, but its at the Waterfront, so whaddya want? Also, my insurance gives me some good discounts for going here, so well see. I have an appointment with the good doc today to tell me just how blind I am, which, if it goes to hell, youll hear about it."
1,It was my first time at Royal Thai Grill. As we walk in the owner greet us right away. My favorite Thai dish is Kra Proa Kai so I had to try it here. I am HAPPY to say it was EXCEPTIONAL! We also order Papaya salad and it was GREAT! We went there around  and we were the only customer there. So we got the best service and full attention from the owner. Really GREAT guy. Its a bit far for me to travel but I definately be back soon!
1,"This is such a great restaurant!  I frequent this restaurant about once a week.  The food is fabulous.  I love the soups, they are made daily and are are wonderful.  The Caesar salad is excellent with just the perfect amount of dressing.  The Dover sole is delicious and I truly enjoy the chicken on a skewer with basmati rice pilaf.  Everything I have ordered has been very tasty.  The owners and staff are very welcoming and friendly.  I love  the way they have decorated too.  This restaurant has great ambiance.  I definitely recommend.  The bar is fun and inviting as well. A must try!"
1,"Super bonne premiuere expuerience! Jy suis alluee gruece ue la soiruee organisuee par ucrik M, et juetais vraiment contente de faire la duecouverte dun bon resto ue fondue. Je trouve que cest souvent meilleure de faire une fondue ue la maison, mais pour se sauver du trouble dorganiser le tout et de faire la vaisselle uea en vaut vraiment la peine. Jai pris lassiette de La Premiuere qui a un peu de tout et cest une bonne iduee pour voir ce que lon aime le plus, ou quand on a de la difficultue ue faire un choix. Quoi? Moi? Pas capable de choisir?   Le service est super chaleureux et notre serveur uetait bien attentif. Cest un bon resto pour un rendezvous ue deux, un souper de famille ou une sortie relaxe entre amis."
1,We had a wonderful time at the taco festival. We got there around  and it we were swept right in. No lines and parking was easy. The organizers of the festival were very organized because getting in was so quick. nnMy favorite tacos were the sausage tacos from the French Cowboy. I need to find that shop because I cant get them off of my mind. nnMy only complaint is I wish there were more vendors that had drinks and tacos. I would like to not have to walk around looking for drinks. But overall and excellent and super fun Saturday.
1,"Stars for the crab legs and shrimp cocktail. nnI havent had this buffet in years, so I was pleasantly surprised to find that what I loved about them before  the crab legs  is as good as ever.nnIm sure other items were delicious, too, but I honestly cant remember. My friend and I were having a crazy huge craving for crab legs and had a less than satisfying crab legs experience the night before, so getting them here so fresh! AND finding plump, perfectly cooked shrimp cocktail, was pure gastronomical joy.nnThe service was excellent, too  everyone smiley and happy  even though we made a big mess. Yes, I cant believe I became one of those Asians that had plates of crab legs in the middle of their table to share. I swore I would never do that till I was at least in the my eighties...but thats how good those legs were...nnA must go again.nnFYI We also had the breakfast buffet here the next morning  the food was fine, but the morning service was lacking."
1,"Great new addition to Roosevelt Row!  We stopped in last night on our way home from the airport and had a great experience.  Nice space, friendly staff and super tasty food.  We tried the rock shrimp, carnitas, tinga and carne asada tacos with rice and beans  flavorful, fresh and just plain tasty!  Good neighborhood place to enjoy some good food on the patio or in the bar while watching the game!"
1,"Tried PJ for the first time during a biz trip, will eat here upon every return. The food is fresh, healthy and delicious. The wait staff is relaxed and appropriately engaging.nLOVE IT  a bright spot!"
1,"Honestly I wasnt really expecting to find anything special in Las Vegas but was taken here at the recommendation of a friend who lived here. Let me just say that the flour tortillas I had were some of the best I have ever had and thats also compared to when I lived in Tucson. They hand make their tortillas in the restaurant and I definitely could taste the freshness. The chips and salsa were okay but on the plus side they made the guacamole from scratch at the table.  However, be warned, the hot salsa is HOT. I think they may use habanero peppers because it had a  really slow intense burn that just lasted and had me tearing up a bit.. nnFor my meal I got the pollo patron which had an unique flavor being that it was marinated in a variety of chiles and other spices. The portion was huge and definitely worth the price. When I do return to Las Vegas and want good Mexican food, Ill make sure to stop here. One caveat my friend shared with me. If youre looking for Americanized Mexican food, there are other places that are better but this is the place to go to for the more authentic plates that you cant get at Chiles or some other place like that."
1,Friend invited me here for lunch one afternoon. Being a science majornerd Id never wandered over to the side of campus Sacks is on mistake  on my part. Mistake  not knowing about this place sooner! When we went they were having some trivia question game going on where you get a free drink if you got the answer right I bet you can guess who got a free soda THIS GIRL!nnOrdered the Sacks Van Gogh so tasty!
1,"Just ate at Pita Pit on Mill Ave for the first time the other night  loved it. They do it Subway style where you pick all of your toppings from a large assortment of veggies  dressings. nThe Pita bread is soft  chewy, the veggies were fresh, the hummus was delicious. And the cherry on top was the super friendly service. There were  girls working  they couldnt have been nicer. nI see a lot of Falafels in my future."
1,"Any independant videogame retailer will always get my  stars simply by default, which is lucky for Chips as Im not  sure theyve earned it.nnIll start with the good. They do retro games, and have more floor space devote to this niche market of the gaming public than pretty much any other such shop Ive seen, including the mighty G Force.nnNow the bad, they dont do import games, meaning that unless somethings been officially released in the UK which many arent you wont be getting it here. This is a massive missed opportunity, especially for me as I cant find a shop anywhere in Edinburgh selling import games."
1,"Yum yum and more yum. We ate here last year and it was great so thought wed try it again this year and definitely not disappointed. I had the vegan veggie burger Im not even a vegan which was grilled eggplant, capsicum I think you call them red peppers here zucchini, on a mushroom cap bun no bread and it was delicious and super filling!! My partner had the All American Classic which he loved as well. nThe service was fabulous despite being packed and even allowed me to change my skinny fries to sweet potato fries a few minutes after I ordered without a hiccup. They had a great service where instead of just waiting they just messaged us when our table was free and we were seated  minutes after we put our names down. nWill we come back here? Definitely!!"
1,"Both times, we had to wait  to  minutes to be seated, but the wait was well worth it. Their entrees are generous and delicious. Im not a pancake eater, but their red velvet pancakes are the best pancakes Ive ever had. Their wait service is great, attentive, fast, friendly, and courteous. Sorry IHOP, BabyStacks got you beat in all categories."
1,"What a great find! Nestled in a downtown building bustling with creative types is a comfy spa that offers all the services you find in a huge spa for much less. You get super personalized service and Andrea, the owner, is awesome, patient and always makes sure that the customer is satisfied. Dont expect the massage to come with anything inappropriate, just expect it to be great. Well worth a trip from the strip, we came all the way from NYC to go here!"
1,"My group had just finished a round of golf and needed some beers and burgers but didnt want to go to a chain....we found this place on Yelp, great place, great food!  As the song that was playing on the jukebox I love this bar  Toby KeithnnWell be back again."
1,"I ate dinner here alone last night at the bar.  When they first opened a former BF and I ate here in the dinning room.  Although the food was amazing the first time, I think the dinning room is not configured well for romance.  Tables are close, like cafeteria kind of close.  In addition the service was just a disconnect...  But lets discuss this visit.  nAmazing.  Sat at the bar and got phenomenal treatment from the bartender.  As all the parties paraded by or waited for the tables, the bar staff not only took care of those folks but some how made me feel i was not eating my dinner in a waiting area.  I started with the roasted Scallops YUMMMMMMM.  Then I had the most magnificent piece of red meat that has ever passed between these lips...  Kobe Rib Cap.  Oh glorious rib cap.  Never have I had entire plate of rib cap,  In fact I had to Google it to know what it was.  Worth the effort to research and read up on it.  LOVE LOVE LOVE.nnSo amazing service, great cocktails, nice wine selection and the best steak I have ever eaten.nnMy new favorite."
1,"An all you can eat sushi extravaganza. The sushi is good quality and for every ten all you can eats you get one free. I guess people go there a lot. The price is typical for Las Vegas Sushi joints. Almost all are All you can eat due to competition. This place always comes up with new things which is nice cause every time you go, you can get something new. The only problem that I have ever had was the wait. So, you know that it gets busy. Great place to try . Even my mom loves it."
1,"My BFF turned  this past Sunday. Her only request was recognizable food  an excellent cocktail list. Nan  Byrons in South End came highly recommended by friends  local media, and they did not disappoint.nnWe started with the Train Wreck Fries. These were amazing. The delicious fries were covered in chili, poblano cheese, sriracha ranch, scallions. We completely killed this platter of fries. We didnt finish them, but we made a pretty significant dent in them.nnBefore our dinners came out, we also enjoyed our cocktails. I had the Farmhouse Lemonade which was Bacardi Limon, Strawberry Vodka, Limoncello, citrus juices, muddled fresh strawberries and lemon. Our table wasnt quite outside, but we were close enough that it was pretty hot. This is was super delicious and so refreshing.nnBrittany had the Nightshade Martini, which was Pearl Pomegranate Vodka, POM Pomegranate Juice, muddled mint and fresh cucumber. I didnt have any of hers, but she loved it. Her only change would have been that the cucumbers should have been soaked in the cocktail.nnWe both LOVED our dinners. I typically go for seafood, but everyone raved about their red meat entrees. They were in the process of changing their menu, so the prime rib I had planned to get wasnt an option. So, I went for the Delmonico. It was  oz. spice rubbed and served with crushed Yukon potatoes, crispy onions, and a red wine sauce. This was absolutely delicious. The meat was tender and full of flavor, and the potatoes had a really cool texture. Different from mashed potatoes and smashed potatoes, and very tasty. The cloves of garlic that came with it were also a perfect little flavor surprise.nnBritt had the meatloaf. It came with sriracha ketchup, but she wasnt sure if shed like it, so she asked for it on the side. I didnt try any of this, but she loved it. I couldnt get over the size of the portion. It was a HUGE serving of meatloaf, veggies and potatoes.nnUnfortunately we both finished our meals, so neither of us had any desire for dessert. Well, there was a desire, but there was no room. At all. But our meal was worth it. Everything was delicious and our server was wonderful! Ill definitely be back on a future Charlotte visit. so"
1,"Not sure where to post about the Hard Rock Hotel  Casino Pool Complex when youre not actually talking specifically about Rehab, which is what you hear about the most so Ill post this here and on the page for the hotel.  But, the coolest thing about the Hard Rock Hotel Pool Complex is that during the week, you can use the pools for FREE!  Yup, I said free!nnWhen we walked in there wasnt anyone around to direct us or check us or anything, so we just grabbed some towels and started wandering to see where we wanted to hang out.  The first thing we saw was the Rehab pool area and there was a DJ booth set up, the big pool and then a bar and swim up gaming that was not being used while we were there.  The pool continued on the other side and around the bar and on that side, there was a water slide.  I was happy about that as I love waterslides!  We wandered until we found a spot that had a little sun, but plenty of shade, too as the husband likes to stay in the shade.  We got settled in and after a little while decided it was time to take a dip. OH HELL NO!  The pool was so freaking cold I could not stay in it... we headed to the Jacuzzi to warm up and I knew there was no way I was hitting THAT waterslide.  The water was like ice water.  That would explain why so few people were in it.  I was pretty bummed, but we went back toour lounge chairs and did some reading.  Oh, by the way, near the DJ side of the pool there are VERY few chairs... if you want to sit, you need to rent the daybeds, etc. that are available, but as you head to the other side, you will find some chairs, but not many!nnAfter wed been there a couple of hours, we decided to go try the little pool near the top of the waterslide to see if it was warmer it wasnt and then we saw a sign for another pool, so started exploring.  What we found were more cabanas that are above the DJ area and another pool, Breathe.  Unfortunately, Breathe was closed so we couldnt even see it, but then we noticed just around another corner was the Nirvana pool and thank you, this one was warm enough to swim in and there was a pool near the bar that was seriously warm.  We picked up our gear and headed over to Nirvana, aptly named at this point.nnNirvana has a sandy beach on one side and the other side is your standard tile pool.  It is also surrounded by cabanas and there is a bar with some bar games and it looks like they do swim up gaming when they are busier.nnIts unfortunate that the other pools are so freezing, but its nice to know that there was still a pool that is swimmable.  I just wish wed discovered it earlier in the day!nnI loved the layout and the landscaping of the Hard Rock pools.  The option for nonguests to visit for free during the week is AWESOME, but I think they make up for it with the outrageous drink prices, so we stuck to the free ice water they set out.  I just cant drop  on a oz drink.  YIKES!nnI definitely recommend you check this out when youre pool hopping Vegas like we do in the summer and we will totally be back if they do this next summer!"
1,"The strawberry tart here is to die for. It is the perfect size for one person and tastes very upscale. I love that it wasnt too sweet! I picked one up at about  PM to store in my hotel mini fridge as a snack to eat after a night of partying. This was the perfect bedtime snack if you ask me!nnOh by the way, I wrote this review right as I was enjoying the tart after a night of partying so I think I did a good job."
1,"I read that the guy who owns GoDaddy shot an elephant...at night...using spotlights...Im thinking his fully tumescent manhood must be the size and color of a  year old raisin...I cant imagine what he thought he was proving by felling one of these magnificent creatures with high poweredlaser sighted rifle from  yards away, while it stood transfixed by the spotlights glare.nnThere was a word that we used for poachers that did the same thing while hunting deer, when I was a kid back in Oregon...Asshole.nnHe did prove to me that I will need to move any and all business I can away from GoDaddy...vote with your feet...but I guess thats another review.nnThe Beautiful Carin and I were in Scottsdale on business this past week and we take these opportunities to spend time with those near and dear to us!nnAt the very tippy top of the near and dear list is our lovely daughter, Whitney.nnWhit is a Vegan...with a capital Vege...and she was distraught by the wanton slaughter of an African elephant by some dot bomb misogynist.nnSo she was thrilled that her meat lovin daddy was going to take her to Green for dinner...an experience so very alien to me that I made Carin pick up a pound of fully cooked bacon and bring it to dinner in her purse for me...just in case!nnI am not a Vegan...I was born and raised on a cattle ranch...I do love a good medium rare ribeye...I dont think it hurts Elsie the Cow to have a teat twiddled so I can have cream in  my coffee or cheese on my burger...and yet, the elephant deal brought a tear to my daughters eye and touched my black flinty excuse for a heart!nnI checked Yelp and saw that while my Vegan friends on yelp love this place, my decidedly carnivorous Yelpy friends were also nearly unanimous in their agreement that Green is foodgasm inducing!nnWe ordered way too much food...Chili Fries, Egg Rolls, a Green Burger, the Secret BBQ Chicken Sandwich, No Harm Chicken Parm...I barely had room to choke down a couple of Tsoynamis and an oatmeal cookie sandwich!nnEven after we were stuffed, Whitney took home enough leftovers for a week!nnThe big question about Green is why didnt I ever eat here, when I lived here...Why?nnI dont know...but I will be putting on my hemp cargo shorts, a tie dye tshirt and growing a neck beard...and I will be eating here again.nnI like to fit in.nnThe menu is fairly extensive...the portions are plenty big...the flavors are bright and well defined and the textures and aromas always a big deal for me are both exotic and welcoming.nnI didnt have to break out the bacon although I should have taken my flask...no cocktails at Green for Donald...oh well, agave sugar cola was a delightful departure from the ordinary.nnI really could eat this way on a regular basis...its that good...I probably wont, but its nice to know I could!nnI imagine that Karma will have its own way of dealing with a selfjustifying, trigger happy technotard...for me, the occasional dinner at Green nicely balances the Karmic forces at work in my life...and tastes good, too!"
1,"The Baristas here always gets it right! Eventhough the location is weird and no drive thru, we love coming here cause the drinks are made correctly! Drinks taste perfect! We love this location and the Barristas are quick!"
1,"A hidden treasure!nnWe try to make it to this place once a week, a great place for a quick lunch or a nice dinner, often times dinner comes with live jazz.  You will not run out of wine or liquor choices here.nnMust trys includenCrab Wontons  Best in town!!!!nMost of their dishes are great and can be had with rice or noodles."
1,"In spirit, this place reminds me of many village bistros in France, having lived in Provence for two years.  The garden setting is a good example of this cafes charm.  nnThe cooking is original.  I loved the wild mushroom soup and my wife rated the pork sandwich as excellent.  Reasonable prices too.  Our bill was  for two starters, two luncheon entrees and iced tea.  nnTip. No liquor license. So BYO.  This makes the place a truly excellent value."
1,"Yum yum yum. Never had a bad meal here  food always delicious and comes out fast.  Love the Pad Thai, Pad Kee Mao, Panang, and of course the Tom Yung Goong. The service has always been good.  Great for dine in or take out.  Still my favorite Thai restaurant in Las Vegas."
1,"Without a doubt the cleanest and best stocked WalMart in the area and for the most part the one with the least vagrants outside asking for money.  Certainly not high standing achievements to offer the very basics of safety and cleanliness, but compared to the two on Charleston and one on Spring Mountain a definite step up."
1,"Good sub joint!  You can get them hot or cold.  Situated in the cool downtown Chandler area ir is good for lunches!nnI would recommend a little wider chip selection. nAs far as a sub it is definitely a step, or three, above Subway or Quiznos."
1,"Pork Rinds and Fried Chicken ? YES PLEASE ! The New Brooklyn Bowl in Vegas is quickly gaining popularity because of its concerts and location at the Linq entertainment area. However, you do not want to miss out on the food because it may be the best part of Brooklyn Bowl and if you time it correctly you can still see and hear the music for free and skip the price of a ticket. Simone and I timed our dinner just right so we got to hear the nights Band rehearsing their set before the concert that night and although it was loud it was still pretty awesome. While taking in the sounds we drank a very good Drunken Palmer drink which was basically Sweet Tea, Lemonade and lots of booze. After starting those, our appetizers of Potato Knishes and House Fried Pork Rinds arrived.  The Potato Knishes were good and reminded me of fried mashed potatoes but with a lot more onion flavor. They were served with sour cream and mustard and were enjoyable but nothing compared to the Pork Rinds. The Pork Rinds are all kinds of fabulous and fabulous is a word I try not to use often. Man, these things were crispy and salty and crispy and salty, and did I mention how crispy they were? They were like bacon on steroids. They were topped with crumbled red onion and Queso Fresco Cheese and had the consistency of a cheese doodle.  They were  light and airy so they were not overly filling and by the time the entruee arrived they were just about gone.  For the entruee, we had Fried Chicken and Ill be damned, it was just as good as the Pork Rinds.  These guys in the kitchen know how to fry themselves up some good eats. The chicken was not heavily breaded and was coated with Matzo meal and then fried, so it didnt seemed as greasy or dense as the well known KFC chicken we have come to love or hate.  We ordered a mix of Dark and White meat and both were equally good in flavor and moistness that sounded really dirty.  I think they were eight pieces of chicken and we were able to finish half of them. The rest were great as leftovers for breakfast a few mornings of our vacation.  The waiter suggested that we dip our chicken in honey and habanero oil that is house made. We took him up on the suggestion and sure enough the combination was delicious.  What a great meal. We skipped dessert after gorging ourselves on fried food but maybe next time.  I would definitely recommend Brooklyn Bowl for some great food and great music."
1,This is where my husband and I go when neither of us want to cook and we want good food.  I love their la italliana pizza and my husband loves the meaty ones.  Their antipasto salad is also delish.  I love the service here too  a small town local kind of place tucked in a little shopping center.  We mostly get takeout here but weve eaten in a few times and the dining atmosphere is great.  Always very pleasant people here in great moods because the food is incredible.  I dont know what they put in their sauce but there must be some sort of crack in it because its super addicting.  We always come back for more!
1,I have been going here for several years now and I love it. They are very clean never had any issues with that. Their pricing is right on not over charging by any means. The pedicure could be way more than they charge  its easily worth . My nails always look amazing. I can never choose what I want to do so I always say whatever you want and they have done awesome art work on them.
1,"Ive had my fair share of Cirque du Soleil performances and while this isnt one of them, I think out of all the ones Ive seen this was the only one that I actually got to SEE. The entire theater was built rather intimately, smaller than most Ive been to, but that means all the viewers are closer to the performers and stage. With the way its built like a coliseum as another Yelper has mentioned, there are no bad seats in the house. I actually got to see the entire performance, unlike most times at Cirque du Soliel shows I have to use binoculars to get a simple glimpse at the show. For the price of , it quite spectacular.nnThe costumes all the performers donned on were beautiful and their makeup and props were also so meticulously put together. There were roaring flames, flying acrobats, water flying, feathers, and much much more. The show is about  minutes long and it was a great  minutes! nnHeres a great tip Go to the restroom beforehand! Moving out of the seats is a pain in the ass."
1,"Was looking for a place that delivers Pizza and found this joint on Yelp.  I ordered a small Pepperoni  Sausage Pizza wJalapenos on  . plus . for each topping.nnThe Pizza was delivered pretty quickly.nhttpwww.yelp.combizphotoswEcJENYQrRnGjGrqw?selectYteHpHLJEpwGZXNAnhttpwww.yelp.combizphotoswEcJENYQrRnGjGrqw?selectHlzLdQthIfPZAgRuwnhttpwww.yelp.combizphotoswEcJENYQrRnGjGrqw?selectecQVJPSRaWlsKLsTbIQnnI took one bite out of a slice and instantly became a fan!  The Sausage had a nice balance of flavors...slightly sweet, but very good.  The Jalapenos are on the spicy side, which is how I like it.....for some people, it may be too much.nnOverall, it was a solid Pizza.nnReturn Factor"
1,"My sister told me to check this place out because she heard they had a really good steak special  . for a  oz steak. She said it was off the beaten path and more of a locals, lowend kind of place. It might have some of the old school Vegas charm left in it. Im happy to say that it did. nnThe place looks like it hasnt been redecorated in a good  or more years. Cement floors, red vinyl seats, lots of wood paneling, cheap drinks  and the . special! The special is not on the menu, so you have to ask for it. Practically everyone who was dining there was eating it. They start you off with a basic green salad which is iceberg lettuce and tomatoes. Then they serve your steak with a choice of potato I had mashed and their vegetable. I was a little disappointed by the steak. I ordered mine medium rare and instead it was more like medium welldone. But for the price, I cant complain. The special also includes a beer since Ellis Island is also a microbrewery. You have your choice of lager, amber, or stout. The mashed potatoes were decent and the vegetables also. Definitely good cheap Vegas eats! Im a fan and I would return here."
1,"Elizabeth Creamery serves up a great variety of ice cream flavors. Im partial to bananaflavored desserts, so I tend to get the banana ice cream. But theyve got tons of interesting flavors to try. My only complaint would be that they really need outdoor seating for the summer months. The shop is in a great row of restaurants and businesses on Elizabeth Avenue. Theres a lot of construction there right now, which can be frustrating, but dont let it deter you from an ice cream fix."
1,"The Golden Nugget seems to be the Wynn of downtown.  It seems to be a little more elegant, a little cleaner, a little nicer, and a little more upscale than most of the others on Fremont.  Its also very crowded, the traffic aisles through the casino are very narrow, and you can get claustrophobic in a hurry.  nnThe last time I was there, the reason for stopping in was to see a show, Defending the Caveman.  The theater was large and had comfortable seating, and I enjoyed the show.nnIve been wanting to try a couple of the restaurants here, but had already eaten dinner at Triple  Brew Pub at Main Street prior to the show.  Will put dinner at Golden Nugget on my list for next trip.nnIts a nice place, and I had a good time at the show."
1,I went here with low expectations because of the few poor reviews. I was so wrong. I love this place! Vikki was amazing and helped me pick out the perfect polishglitter combo! Everyone there was so nice. I just had a mani to try them out. Ill be making an appt for a pedi this weekend!
1,I have to say even with its few minor faults  nI absolutely LOVE this hotel!!!! nnMy boyfriend and I stayed in a lovely big suite for my birthday last August we even brought our dogs!! n the room was AMAZING !!!! nSo fun!!! nnDown side beingnThe food isnt exceptional they dont really cater to my food allergies and over all the bar staff drinks are just meh ok !! nnThe location is great close to old town etcnnThe decor style ambiance of the hotel is my favorite!! ...nnI kind of feel like I am in an episode of Mad Men lol !!! nnRecommend !!!

It is right across the street from UNLV so easy peesy.nFood was very tasty, I had a chicken salad in a tortilla of course, yummy!nThe restaurant dining area was clean and the staff was helpful and nice. The tea was empty, all of the teas were empty  so I had a soda, not a fan of soda.. Anywho, really yummy food here, I recommend it..."
1,"Okay, first of all lets talk about the atmosphere!  Really bright colors, fun decor and a super feel of the Spanish culture to it.  nnWe were visiting from out of town and turned once again to Yelp to help us out.  We were anything but let down!  We got there about an hour before they closed on a Friday night, so the place was pretty dead.  Our server was helpful and friendly.  nnI tried the Brava Burro with the Baja sauce a suggestion by our server.  My wife went with Chicken Pablano with beans and rice.  The food portion sizes were huge, but it matched the price.  We ordered some extra spicy salsa that was really good and spicy.  The chips and salsa they have is some of the best Ive ever had!  Really fresh tasting and the right amount of spice.  nnI asked some of locals about this place and most of them say its their favorite.  We left painfully stuffed, but it was so good not to finish it all!  Also a huge variety of margaritas that were oz, nice and strong and good flavor!   An easy  star place... dont believe me, go and try it for yourself!"
1,"I placed an order for pickup at this restaurant and I had to write a review about what I just ate. I asked for a chicken Kebob with a house salad  which was on the plate instead of on the side and white rice and everything was delicious!! The chicken was tender and it had a great grilled flavor, the salad had a wonderful house vinaigrette with some pickled onions with lime juice and basil and even the plain white rice tasted awesome! I also got some kind of ciabatta bread which I ate it with some olive oil and parmesan, I enjoyed every bite of this dish, it was exactly what I was craving for and more, I would definitely order again from this restaurant. The only reason I gave them  stars was the service I received, a big, bald man came to meet me at front and he was kind of rude to me."
1,"Stunning hotel and resort. We enjoyed the Sunday brunch buffet and were sat in the garden. The variety and quality of food was awe inspiring. In particular I enjoyed the smoked salmon pizza, coffee, fresh oj,dessert offerings, and gelato the most."
1,"First time here. We found the place a good place for a quick meal. Place is well staffed with plenty of seats. We were there on Sunday at mid morning and although busy, there was not more than a few minutes wait. nnService was excellent from everyone. Orders taken quickly, coffee and waters kept filled, and all our orders came out together and in a timely manner. nnMenu selection was excellent, breakfast is served all day. Prices are reasonable for a strip location. We all liked our food. nnWe would return."
1,"What can I say? Flancers is excellent. I have yet to have a bad dish there. If I were to have one complaint about Flancers it would be its popularity. It is completely common to pull into the parking lot and see all walks of life sitting outside waiting for their name to be called. Its not a large establishment!nnI ordered the Chili Verde Birdie sandwich which rocked the ole taste buds! The pizzas are also not to be missed! Service is great and the ambiance is quite upbeat!nnFunny story, I was FBing with a friend and I had mentioned I was on my way to Flancers for my first visit. Upon getting there, the manager Jimmy asked if I was the guy on Facebook chatting them up. Ultimately, Jimmy gave me a card for  off my next visit as a thank you! Now thats service!"
1,"Great new place off the beaten path.nI had lunch here for the prefix price of .nIt came with appetizer, main course and cappuccino nThe food is awesome and so is the atmosphere. nDinner is usually busier so try lunch here if you can.nAll the dishes are seasoned perfectly and no minor details are missed here in the food."
1,"It is refreshing to see a restaurant make use of the small things to make a big impact.   Fiesta Mexicana has a large varied menu with above average food, great salsa but more important an atmosphere full of color and life.  The wait staff look sharp in their uniform attire, and our waiter was professional and attentive.  The surroundings were very clean, pleasing being artfully colorful and bright, without going overboard.  Music was pleasant without being too loud so we could also enjoy conversing with one another at the table.  My wife said her margarita was fantastic.  The food looked great and even the plates were nice!  Prices were maybe a bit higher than average, but when you want quality food, service and atmosphere you at least get more than you pay for at La Fiesta."
1,"K, Its acutally a . but we ll round it up to .nDont really know what the hype is all about. This was argualbly one of the most expensive meals I ve had, however, Cant really say that it was my favourite. As a matter of fact, Gf would give it a , and I would give it a , so here we are at !nWe went for the tasting menu like others and to be honest, the best part was getting to watch the chef making and preparing the food. Food was tasty, however, I cant say that it was worth the money that I paid for it. nIf you wanna impress your significant other, by all means go to this place, however If you are not from Vegas, chances are for the money you are spending here, u can get alot better stuff back home."
1,"FE is great! I love that its small  has much of what I need. I like not having to walk a mile through the parking lot, through the store just to get some milk like you have to do in the other grocery stores especially Target. The only thing I dont like is that they have taken away slowly name brand products and replaced them with FE generics that arent as good."
1,"One of my favorite places to go. The staff is very friendly and always making great recommendations for the perfect dish. The food itself is truly delicious, and there are so many options to try for a low cost."
1,"As conveniently located in Las Vegas MGM Grand as the real life Shibuya district is to Tokyo, this place surprised me immenselywe had a very strong, authentic meal at the sushi bar that would rival any sushi bar nationally, if not in Shibuya itself. nnStandouts included a superb big eye tuna which was so fresh we needed to order a second helping, a tiny and shiny Japanese Mackerel fish, a terrific hot scallop special, and great Sapporo draft beer on tap, too. nnA true find in the MGM, Shibuya is the real deal."
1,"Very good dim sum. Not truly exemplary but it was flavorful and filling without being overly salty or anything. The price was good but the selection was kinda so so I have been told its better on weekends, we went around noon on a Monday and the service was alright. There were only two carts going so it was pretty slow. One of the ladies was also pretty mean.nnDecent dim sum though!"
1,"Our new thai food favorite. The owner has been here every time and is just so cheery, pleasant and hospitable.  The food is delicious and more than fairly priced. My recommendation would be their pan ang curry, which is just the right amount of sweet. To top it all off the thai teas here come with free refills."
1,Great food and reasonably priced. Its Vegas so everything comes off as plasticy but the food was great as was the service... hold for the sommelier who was just a pompous ass. Other than that the only downside was the dessert I chose... basically like  chocolates on a plate. No bueno.
1,"I had visited Yogurtland near Chanfler Fashion Centre opposite to Forever  from far road. Its so yummy, I took some friends there they loved it too. I usually like Red Velvet Cupcake , Madagascar Vanilla, Cocunut,Cheesecake. nnI went to tempe location and Yash was very nice and polite in greeting. Its . for  Oz and you can get your points added to your account too."
1,"Best Sloppy Joes known to man!!!nnWe discovered Society Cafe for the first time last December during our first stay at the Encore.  It was an odd hour and was pretty much empty...perfect for our hangovers!!!  We plopped down at the bar and ordered some drinks and requested menus.  In my hungover state all that I could see on the menu was Sloppy Joes.  They come in sliders and in a burger form.  I ordered the Sloppy Joe sliders.  They were so good that I actually finger licked my plate clean of all Sloppy Joe juice...totally disgusted my husband.  Once the headaches began to lift we began talking to the two bartenders working...Robert and Eric.  Freaking HILARIOUS!!!!  We had so much fun sitting with them that we returned every day for lunch for the rest of our stay.  I had a Sloppy Joe every single day for lunch!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!nnWe have been frequenting Vegas this past year and everytime we are in town we eat lunch at Society Cafe and sit at the bar so we can be entertained by our favorite Vegas bartenders.  I ALWAYS order the Sloppy Joe sandwich more Sloppy Joe meat than the sliders and am ALWAYS satisfied.  My husband has tried some other things on the menu and has thought everything was good, but he LOVES the sweet potato fries.  I am not a fan of sweet potatoes, but he raves about these..nnI highly recommend Society Cafe to any Sloppy Joe fans!!!  However, I do recommend sitting at the bar as the restaurant tends to have a bit of a stuffyquiet vibe to it!!!"
1,"I have a huge sweet tooth. This place is like heaven for me. They always have coupons and if you get a stamp card you get a free  pound after you buy five. They have all the candies you used to love as a kid. They also have chocolate, PEZ, salt water taffy, and pretty much any other candy you could think of. This place is a guilty pleasure of mine, and I will continue going back when Im strolling Mill Avenue."
1,"The cactus garden is beautiful, but what we really came for was chocolate.  These are highquality, attention to detail chocolates, and are totally worth every penny.  nnTheres a selfguided tour inside where you can view the workers actually making the candies using the old copper pots....it is quite interesting.  At the end of the tour, youre led into temptation as delightful goodies abound all around.  Youre given a choice of a sample of their dark, milk, or white chocolate we chose dark.nnI decided upon a box of  handselected candies  mostly the raspberry cremes because those are my sons favorites.  He was flying into McCarran from his army base in Louisiana on a week leave and I wanted to surprise him.   Alas, the box of candy was stolen when we inadvertently left it in a restaurant across the street from the airport after we picked him up.  I suspect one of the employees enjoyed the added perk in addition to the tip I left.nnAnyhow, these candies are higly recommended.  Next time Im in the area, Ill definitely have to stop by."
1,"This Target is one of my favorite stores in all of Charlotte.  It is in an area with tons of places to eat and shop.  This store has an optical with a very friendly staff to help you purchase contacts, glasses, or sunglasses.  They can even do eye exams on you if you need a new prescription.  Beside of the optical station is the Target clinic where you can visit for minor, nonemergency issues like sinus infections or strep throat.  They are very quick and ready to help get you better ASAP.  The selection if merchandise at Northlake Target is even better than the Midtown Target.  They even have people who give food samples on certain days.  nnIf you go to Optical at Northlake, ask for Sierra.  She is AWESOME!   If you go to Pharmacy, Jenice is super friendly and will give you a flu shot or fill your script quickly.  nnThe store is very clean and filled with team members who are ready to help you with a positive shopping experience."
1,"I have been looking on yelp for new places to go and eat, being that we are fairly new to the area. I seen the pictures of all the different pancakes and had to come and try for myself! AMAZING! I had steak and eggs and banana cream pie shirt stack Great food friendly staff and decent prices ! We will definitely return"
1,"Recently found this gem on the the hippy Willy St. Being able to venture out of the UW campus and seeing a different scenery is just what I needed! The coffee shop has great ambiance I love the maps and the globes in the shop as well as other post WWII decors. As for coffee, lattes are decent. Im here more for the ambiance than the coffee. Tables are slightly smaller if you are the type that like to spread out. Oh, another plus, plenty parking available."
1,"Oh Iruna you have captured my heart!  To start my friend and I had the tortilla espanola which had thinly sliced potatoes held together with a mixture of onion, paprika, and egg.  A lemon aioli was drizzled over the thick slice and it was a really great way to start our tapas feast.  The rest of the meal consisted of lovely mild potatospinach cheese puffs served with a romesco sauce, chicken served is a spicy oil with a creamy sauce towards the center and topped with pickled onions  drool , shrimp coated in spices and garlic, and ,of course, a pitcher of red sangria.  nOur waitress was super sweet and very attentive.  Anytime our glasses were getting low shed swing by our table to refill them.  With such good food and service Ill definitely be going back to Iruna soon."
1,"You come to Edinburgh and dont come here if you are a tourist? If you grew up here you probably came here once when you were a kid avoided the place because it is full of tourist.  But since I was visiting as a tourist I came to check this place out.nnThe Castle dominates the surrounding area with great views of the city, it is a little pricey to get in but I think it has a number of well curated museums if you are into history and in particular military history.  There are the rolls for a number of warsbattles for the fallen, and each of the Scottish Military Regiments have their Regimental museums here too.nnThe are aplenty so bring a camera with lots of memory, a jacket and a bottle of water."
1,"What is a veg doing reviewing Outback, you wonder? well. . .nI like to give cred where I see fit. It wasnt my choice of restaurant of course, but my friend Angie gave me that doeeyed look when I suggested that our dinner spot could be her choice. nnI will admit that upon arriving I assumed Id be stuck with an option of salad and....salad. Much to my delight I had some options to choose from and this is what I indulged innnComplimentary breadnComp bread is just that... youre stuck w what you get, but surprisingly it was fluffy and not rock solid when taking a bite and the waitress didnt mind bringing multiple refills to enjoy w our entrees. nnCaesar Salad nSalad was fresh and made perfectly as requested with NO dressing and blue cheese crumbles added on top. nnNo Rules parmesan pastanI loved this. They have an actual pasta listing where I can ADD meat if I want to or just get the pasta independently. Also, the waitress was good about asking me how spicy I want my noodles and made sure I was aware that they use cayenne pepper to add spice which I appreciated knowing.nnStrawberry Peach SangrianLight floral notes w floating strawberries on top. Delicious to say the least and something refreshing I could sip throughout dinner.nnNot my first, second, or third choice to eat as a vegetarian, but as far as being accomodating to my diet, Id say above average."
1,"I dont know how InNOut manages to consistently hire the nicest, friendliest and most attentive employees and yet somehow they manage to do so. I wish they could bottle up their greatness and pass it on to other fast food chains.... but I cant imagine how that would ever help their business model. Completely delicious and supremely fresh eats plus exceptionally friendly service!"
1,"Dave  Busters is a fun place that my boyfriend and I have been going to for many years, back when it was Jillians and always have a good time. The games are fun, the bowling alley is cool, the drinks are good I mean whats not to like. I will admit the food is not the best but its a game place so who really goes there to eat? They change the games every so often to keep up to date  I love the casino feeling games where you win tickets when you push tokens over the edge. How funny it is to sit and watch grown adults so into games!  Its even fun to take the kids with us sometimes shhh dont tell them we go by ourselves on  price game day! our yr old is at the age where he really gets into some of the games. We take family here when they come in town for a fun night as well. nDave  Busters gets  stars in my book, really no complaints here."
1,I have visited this location twice. The employees are always friendly and my drinks always come out great!nnI had a coupon for a free drink once and the barista gave me the largest one I could get. It was nice of him to recommend it.
1,"Yummy times ten. Great meal, great service!nnI booked on Open Table and arrived to find that the place was barely a quarter filled. Nice. We were immediately seated at a table towards the back, near the very filled wine racks. Sadly, my wife and I arent wine drinkers but if you are then youll be pleased. I chose a Catawba draft instead.nnThe taste of four starter is the way to begin here. Scoops of hummus, tzatziki sauce, red pepper and eggplant with a nice serving of slices whole wheat pitas. Probably too much for two to start with because there was a lot there and we were uh, what? when our main courses arrived.nnMy wife chose the lobster ravioli. A very large portion with plenty to bring home, especially after we filled up on the starter. Tasty, creamy, seafoody is seafoody a word? and easy to eat. Delish.nnI had the quarter chicken which was served with potatoes and other veggies. A very big portion, there was a lot of flavor and texture in here, with the perfectly al dente potatoes.nnDessert? Well, I guess we can try. We split a piece of baclava which came topped with some sort of lightly peachflavored ice creamyogurt. Delish.nnSTUFFED with a delicious meal. Well be back."
1,"We had a great time here. I love that you can completely customize your burgers and salads to your liking.nnThe sweet potato fries were awesome. So good. I had a burger with mozzarella, tomato and a wheat bun while my husband had a chili burger. Super good place for burgers!nnOur service was really good too. It was late on a Thursday night, so they werent busy, but our waiter was friendly and nice. She brought us a few beers to taste and our sweet potato fries out quickly extra points because we were incredibly hungry.nnId never heard of this place before, though I think its a chain? The inside is classic sports barish with fun decor and good music."
1,"During summer, in town square, it is so hot. Everytime i pass by the lollicup, i cant resist to go and wait in line and get a boba milk tea. I ask them to put less sugar everytime and they did. it was a perfect and quick fix when you are thirsty and hot in townsquare las vegas!!!"
1,"I was referred to Ling by two friends and let me tell you all the rave reviews are real!  Ling is an amazing soul who makes you feel happy and comfortable just being in her presence.  She helped me tremendously understand the issues Ive been having for almost all my life.  Walking out of her place, I felt like ,, brand new dollars    I cannot express more kind words towards this woman and what shes doing to help us get back on our path.  Thank you SO much Ling and I cannot wait for our next conversation!!"
1,"I love this airport, because it is my entry portal into the city of sin. Kinda sad that I can instantly start losing my money on the slots as soon as I step off of my plane. You can totally tell who has been partying hard and ready to go home on return flights Im definitely that chick who waits for her returning flight with a huge water bottle and my sunglasses on, because Im hating life. It is also pretty sweet that there are tons of shops that sell unique things such as that one lingerie store that sells rave furries. Security is never a hassle so bonus for that. Until we meet again Vegas!"
1,"Restaurant reviewnSimply delicious. Yelp was spot on that this location has likely the freshest high quality mexican food that may top the best in the US. It was so busy  minutes into opening that we had to take our food to go. There is a wide selection of authentic mexican dishes. I ended up with a selection of tacos steak, pork, and carnitas. Although they were soggy by the time I got home, the ingredients were so fresh and the flavor was perfect. Not too salty and rich in flavor. The prices are perfect a lot cheaper than Rick Bayless Xoco. I just wish it was easier to find parking or even space to eat in. You get chips and  types of salsa for free as well even if you are getting carry out. I was surprised I only got  bag even with four entrees. I will have to make sure I ask for more next time. Overall this is probably the best mexican restaurant I have ever been tonnPro delicious mexican authentic and fresh nnCons very small parking lot and equally small dining areannHidden gemnFree salsa and chips"
1,"Coffee is great, but we always end there around lunch. My kids get sandwiches and cookies and the last time I had their southwestern egg wrap with egg whites. Yum yum!! I love living up in this area and love having a small mom and pop place to go to."
1,I have been to this ugrent care a couple times and the staff is always friendly. I really feel comfortable with Dr. Sloan and would recommend this urgent care to anyone that needs to be treated in a timely manner or after doctor office hours.
1,"Great lobster risotto. Dover sole only so so. Excellent service, great dessert. nnShows in the little grottolake were amusing, whimsical, and not overwhelming or annoying. Just the right touch.nnThis is a great option to go enjoy the Wynn and their service if you are not up for the steak house experience.  I would for sure go back."
1,"Yay for Sourdough!  This is East Mesa folks, not exactly a culinary destination.  But this is good pizza!  Its local and been around forever, so its not exactly trendy.  Please dont take your first date here unless you are an octogenarian on a day pass from the assisted living facility.nNo thin crust to be found on this menu.  But pile whatever toppings you can fit on the pizza and enjoy a hearty slice.  They have a decent drink selection, and lots of other italian items on the menu that Ive never tried because the pizza is so good.  Its a popular destination for the winter snowbirds, if you go a little later in the evenings, you can avoid the rush.  But three generations of my family have loved this place and the next time you are crusin Apache Junction, you should check it out!"
1,"When I came here w my friends I think Rok was still a relatively new nightclub I could be mistaken though so we hadnt heard much about it. We were staying at the New York New York Hotel and had gone out to another club the night before so we thought why not try the one actually at our hotel.  It was awesome because when our feet got tired we ran upstairs to get flip flops then came back to keep dancing.nnThe drinks here were pretty good, the dance floor was big and crowded but thats expected, the table in the middle w a stripper pole looked like fun but Im too chicken to get up and do that haha.  A couple girls I was w decided to get up there and dance and had a great time!  nnThe inside is nice and big and the bathrooms were clean from what I remember. My friends and I had a great time at Rok and Im definitely down to come back and party here again!"
1,"Really enjoyed our meal at Olive  Ivy. We tried the sangria, which was good but not great. Id definitely try something else if I went again but it was totally drinkable. Bacon wrapped dates were amazing...so good. The breadpesto dip is as good as everyone else on Yelp says. I had the sea bass which was delish, and my husbands scallops were great too  his corn mixture under the scallops was the best part I think! To finish we had the ice cream bar dessert...how can you go wrong with caramel ice cream, marshmallow, peanut butter and magic shell topping??? So tasty. The atmosphere was great, very classy and hip but casual at the same time. Our server was great, fabulous sense of humor and made us feel very welcome there. Overall a great experience!"
1,"omg DROOL. the dessert bar, you have to eat everything.... which is quite a challenge after eating the main food. I wish they had more seafood but they have tons of other yummy stuff to fill you up. like yes, the dessert bar.nnwe went for lunch there so i believe it was around . the cab ride there from the main strip is pretty far though, but its worth it! if you like the wynn buffet, then come here first!"
1,"Colleens is a store like no other. They have a huge selection of new and used pieces but the highlight is the uniqueness you can find there. I have shopped Colleens for  years and almost everything in my house if from there!nHeres a tip  you must visit the stores often, merchandise turns over really quickly so one day you might see nothing then next week you can find lots.nEach store has different items and everything I have seen at the other big stores Colleens has always had lower price.nOn new merchandise always ask if that is the best price sometimes they can work with you. Consignment is only discounted with the sellers approval after it has been on the floor for a certain number of days.nBest advice If you see something you love buy it or it will be gone when you go back. I have had that happen twice...while I was still in the store!!!!"
1,"Freeds is one of our guilty pleasures whenever we find ourselves in the Henderson area. Our favorites are the Parisian chocolate mousse and black forest cakes . per slice. The cake layers are moist and soft while the buttercream is light and yummy.nnThey are well known for designing custom wedding cakes, even ones that strike a remarkable resemblance to a Coach purse with jewels and all. They also have a selection of naughty erotic cakes for bachelor and bachelorette parties that you can view online. The bachelorette cakes are decidedly more racy, and lets just say, anatomically and physiologically correct, ahem. Eating cake has never been more fun, no doubt."
1,"Years ago I spent  days in Napoli, Italy.  The little pizza restaurant next to my hotel made the BEST thin crust pizza I ever tasted.    Years later I end up in Montreal, and heard there were TWO restaurants that did very good woodfireNapoli style Pizza.  Bottega and Magpie.      I tried both, and found Bottega to be the best.   The service was prompt and efficient.   I did not have a reservation, but was seated, with the advisory that I had about  minutes.    I ordered the Margherita pizza  which was quickly delivered.  The crust was perfection  the sauce simple and slightly sweet  not too acidic. the taste of the Basil came through perfectly balanced.   The Wood Fire Oven is in the back of the restaurant  but visible and cool to watch.  The vibe of the restaurant is modern, active and a bit on the noisy side.  Its full always  and a bit loud with a lot of conversation, but it was bearable.   I tried Magpie  but the service was not great, while the crust was good  I prefer that of Bottega.   My Goto Napoli style pizza in Montreal is now Bottega!  Bravo!   Value for Money    out of .  A bit on the pricey side about same as Magpie ."
1,". stars. The Johnny Johnny roll stands outmild spicy soft shell crab inside, tuna, avocado and special sauce outside. They will serve half rolls during all you can eat. The rice is exceptionala little more sweet than I am used to, but exceptional. Stellar cuts of fish for the nigiri! My husbands favorite was probably the Cajun Lover. nnI will definitely return."
1,"Great facility. I came here since , and still a member.nnThe only bad thing is people working out there. No one ever heard of a deodorant. Although, the time to avoid this gym is at the peak hours do not come around  PM to  PM. The benches are always full, and the gym is crowded with people.nnThe location is great since it is in the heart of downtown. Staff is very friendly and approachable. Lots of classes and lessons. They have a gym for sports they have a schedule for that.nnYouth center is another plus. It allows young people  and under to gather up and they can relax in the room that has several couches, a pool table, and a foosball table. The youth staff volunteer I presume are super friendly, and they promote education and prevention of drugsviolence."
1,"This is the most ginormous spa ever. I dont remember the stats exactly but they have over a hundred masseuses on call. The waiting lounge was beautiful, I almost fell asleep there. I was a little disappointed at the massage, it was only mediocre, perhaps I was just unlucky. I loved the anti gravity chair. It doesnt make you float but it certainly helps you relax. Would definitely go again and spend a few hours there next time I visit Vegas."
1,"Let me start by saying this place has serious  star potential in fact, I may be going back next week, so I will update. nnThe husband and I came here for happy hour and it was ridiculously awesome. I had been here when it was Mabels, and not much has changed here in the way of decor. Additionally, I think they kept some of the same or similar menu items. Anyway, we sat at the bar and the bartender Meagan I think... was awesome. She was just the right amount of friendly and attentive without being invasive. I tried their punch of the day  on HH which was a ginger beer, hibiscus, vodka, and lemon concoction that was absolutely incredibly delicious. I also tried a drink off their regular menu  on HH that was pimms, ginger beer, and some other ingredients, which was good, but not as good as the punch. The drinks were full sized, so it was a pretty smokin deal. The husband got the magic hat beer... so good... it was like a mix between a pale ale and a hef. We also shared the mac and cheese  on HH. This thing was legit delicious. It was a huge bowl for  and was garlicky... almost like an alfredo. I would love to eat this again. I will definitely be back!!"
1,Steak was ok...DoubleBaked Potato with Truffle Cream was wonderful. nnOur waiter was nice and bought truffles out to us to show how it looked liked.  He also brought us ice cream sandwiches that I loved.
1,"Heard some nice things about this place, so decided to check it out for a saturday lunch buffet. It closes at  PM on weekends and I was pretty impressed that were ready to serve folks who came in after  PM and did not turn them away.nnThe spread was pretty vast. I tried onion pakoda and gobi  which were pretty good. Veg biryani and Pasta were decent. Non veg spread was amazing, they really are multi cuisine and had Chicken Majestic and Kungpao chicken both delicious. Tandoori chicken was great and not like the typical lunch buffet tandoori chicken read stale and fresh from the fridge reheated you get in most indian restaurants. Two rounds of the appetizers and I had no space left for chicken biryani which is usually my go to item in buffets.nnThe price of . is way below what I expected, but Im not complaining. The service was good for most parts but it could go up a notch. I dont get the negative review and totally think it is definitely on par if not above spice cafe and spice . Go check it out today!!nnP.S. Im looking forward to dinner there to try the hyderabadi biryani and haleem."
1,"I am a big fan. I have been to all the big gyms in the Phoenix area and this location has the biggest emphasis on safety. The same price as the other gyms but they have ladies night Wednesdays! It is about half off for females which makes it much more affordable without a monthly membership. They have a lot of great deals. There is lead, self belay climbing, and a good selection of bouldering. I really enjoyed it! Previously I noticed a lot of mobile problems and there was one incomplete route I saw but overall I really enjoyed it. Cant wait to get back!"
1,"Thanks YELP! again!  I really like this place and would have never found it if it wasnt for YELP!nnIve eaten there several times now, both for lunch and dinner, excellent Mexican seafood  very authentic.  Great flavor, great salsa in a very casual environment that gives a lot of the local hispanic flavor of Guadalupe!  The music on the jukebox is often traditional Mexican Mariachis and everyone speaks Spanish  a great meal and great bargain!"
1,"This place is yummy. The lunch specials are awesome, and even dinner is very reasonable. The panang curry and larb salad are my favorites. Ill definitely be adding this to my list of Thai restaurants."
1,"Had this buffet for dinner about  weeks ago. It was spectacular. I have never seen so much food in my life. And just about everything I added to my plate was good. I think we paid around . per person and I thought it was worth every penny. Get there early, though we arrived at pm and there was no line  minutes later, it was unbelievable!! Make sure to try a little of everything. Otherwise youll feel deprived. Enjoy!"
1,"Cheap eats in Vegas short drive from the strip. nnMust try, their chicken wings!  OMG, the salt and pepper chicken wings are so delicious and the meat is super tender.  Got a great flavor and its made to order. nnWe also got some stir fried bok choy that was really tasty and  of their congee.  nnI love the preserved egg congee and pork.  Their fish congee was just ok, the fish smelled and tasted slightly fishy....  The congee is the thick style and its like  for a big bowl.  nnIn the midst of all the pricy places to eat in Vegas, this place is a nice break on your pocketbook if you want something simple and tasty."
1,"Loved this place!!! I ventured here, because it is quite a distance from my abode. I was not disappointed in the least and plan on making the trek regularly in the future. The combination of rolls and appetizers on their AYCE menu is vast. They have the cooked rolls with mayo and crab and crunch that my sister loves and they also have the poke and Cajun albacore that I adore. Service was impeccable and the lunch price at  is totally worth it. My nephew ate for  AYCE. This is definitely one of my fave AYCE places in town!"
1,"We stayed here with Marriott Rewards with only about  hours notice the Friday night between Christmas and New Years.  I was surprised that there was availability.  nnIve been here before for drinks, but not as a guest.  nnThe layout of the hotel is a little tough.  We got lost got tofrom our room a few times...the elevators arent marked well enough.  nnThe room is a good size, considering Im used to staying in DC and NYC.  The bathroom was big and super shiny and clean.  Lots of towels and a good hair dryer.  nnThe linens were great on the beds and the pillows were nice too.  I think that all of the rooms have a balcony, which is a bonus.  We had a nice room overlooking the pools, which would be great in warmer weather.nnId definitely use points to stay here again."
1,"Only place for a long platter and the best corn beef on rye.. . This is an every Friday morning treat for us.  Great service great deli counter cooks. . What more to say,  oh,  yes,  the bagels. Tuesdays bagel special . dozen"
1,"Great prices, assuming  You have the time to dismantle a wrecked or dead car and  You know exactly what you are getting intonnI got into a major fender bender a few weeks ago. Not wanting to deal with overpriced shipping costs for new parts from the internet hint Online stores almost double the amount of money you are paying!, one of my friends told me about this place which I never heard of.nnOn my first day and one and a half hour trying to locate a dead  Corolla to salvage for parts, I pulled out a used hood latch that I needed from a  Camry. I already knew off the top of my head that it is going to fit, basing it on the diagrams I googled for a new one online. nnI thought it was difficult to locate the cars though. After  minutes of walking around the Toyota Section, whatever  Corolla that remained must have been picked clean. There was no paint markers on the dirt, or signs sticking out that would label the correct lane that the Corolla was supposed to be sitting in. Also I noticed some car hoods were held up solely by the dismantled valve covers left behind from other customers who went through it.nnI also found it interesting to examine how many different ways a car can end up inoperable. There was this one particular dead Toyota that looked like from the smashed windshield it ran someone over. Something heavy mashed the right part of the windshield and bounced off in some sort of accident. If anyone wanted to start off as a automotive technician, they should be a regular paying customer of PicAPart. They only charged me a  cover to walk through the gates.nnSince it took me two hours to get through multiple traffic jams today, I plan on returning soon to look for a compatible hood, radiator support, left headlight assembly, and left turn signal lamp, since I only paid  dollars plus tax for a fully functional hood latch. That is already one steal of a deal! Online stores attempted to charge me as much as  before shipping and tax."
1,"From the last few reviews, it sounds like The Kitchen is exactly like the former tenant Dish. Well Ive never been to Dish, but I like The Kitchen just fine. The Kitchen looks like a Bristol Farms or Whole Foods Deli minus the market. While there are some packaged foods such as pastas, wine, cheeses, and beverages, the real appeal is the deli, rotisserie, bakery and cold case. nnI came here twice in one day. For lunch, I had the prime rib sandwich with dip ready au jus and pasta salad. Dinner was a mini baguette and a wedge of Humboldt Fog goat cheese. Thats the appeal of The Kitchen. You can have a heavy meal with all the trimmings or you can pick out a few things here and there and have yourself a picnic. nnSince Im working close by, I know Ill be back several more times before I leave Scottsdale. But for anyone looking for a great lunch spot, the variety alone is worth the trip."
1,"My inlaws and mom was in town so I decided to take them and my wife to Le Reve.nnI just love going to the Wynn.  It is so elegant and one of the most beautiful and classy hotels on the strip.nnAnyways, Le Reve is one of the most impressive shows on the strip.  The theater environment is amazing.  Honestly, not a bad seat in the house.  The story and the water show were excellentl.  I have to say that all your senses will be lit up yes... smell, taste, touch, sight, and hearing...  Trust me, we sat pretty close and had a few light sprinkles nnCompared to the Cirque du Soleil acts on the strip  O and Mystere, I honestly think Steve Wynns vision of Dream was much better.  It was much more elaborate, exciting, and original.  Overall, I think Le Reve is one of the best in Vegas thus far, our favorites have been Phantom, Jersey Boys, and now Le Reve.nnAlso, btw, I like the fact that they allow you to take pictures at the END of the show. nnI definitely would recommend this show."
1,"I just love their Southwestern egg rolls and their appetizer sampler is always a good thing to try if you want to variety of appetizers which could also turn into a meal for three people if you so chose! I know my sister and I with my niece could not finish this platter without eating even a main entruee! Its around  and well worth it for fried food which I only eat every now and again, and their fried food is the best!!"
1,"Take your time to browse and be open to new possibilties.  I purchased many used books at this shop, and plenty of sheet music, all for killer deals.  Its always a required stop on my downtown Urbana excursions.  Many used stores dont survive with high rents and chain competition, so please patronize your local used bookstore."
1,"Located in Ocean Terminal this is a rather large branch of Clinton Cards with a fabulous range of cards, wrapping paper, stationary and gifts. I spent a lot longer than I should have done in here and picked up a few bargains along the way.nnAs an animal lover, I was delighted that they had a range of little compact mirrors, pencils, pens and key rings with animals on them. Everything in the very cute range was reduced to p so I snapped up a few of the little compacts.nnI was hysterical when I noticed the most bizarre gift ever in the wedding section. It was a box saying Congratulations on your Wedding Day and inside was the cheapest looking bobble head black cat wearing a diamante collar and earrings. What? I dont know much about weddings and am not sure if this is some kind of tradition but Ive certainly never heard of it before and it really was the most bizarre thing Ive ever seen. I would love to see the look on the happy couples face when they open that up. Dont count on getting an invite to the Golden Anniversary party if you turn up to the wedding with such a gift. I urge everyone to go in to see it  its hilarious!nnAside their odd choice of wedding gifts, this branch of Clinton Cards is well stocked, very well organised and the staff are friendly too."
1,"Weve stayed at Wynn and Palazzo, regularly stay at Bellagio, and we knew this place was ultra modern but wow!  Had an Aria one bedroom Sky Suite which includes airport transportation to and from property and access to the private lounge Bellagios remains the best, offering wine and spirits to Arias Wine.  nnRoom was very well appointed, nice view they call it City view, facing their pools easy to get to and very easy to enjoy.  Mini fridge with ice maker was very nice touch, so too are the options on television, including many music channels. nnThe Staff here is exceptionally attentive and courteous.  To say i would stay here again is almost a nobrainer."
1,"Yes, this place is pretty darn pricey but my wife came up with a great plan that saved us a bunch of money.  The main courses range in price from  or so and for two people to eat with an appetizer and a few drinks and the bill can get in the  or more range.  Instead of ordering two meals, we ordered  appetizers which were reasonably priced and more than enough food for the two of us.  It was a fantastic meal and we got to try a number of dishes without breaking the bank.  Sure, we probably missed out on an incredibly steak but we left happy.nnOnly reason for not giving  stars was the ambience.  The restaurant has all windows around the exterior and is right next to the sports book.  It was very distracting with  giant screens of horse racing behind my wife while we were talking."
1,"One lovely morning, I had a wonderful breakfast on the patio here.  It was about  for two OJs, one coffee, an omelet and pancakes.  A little much but the food was wonderful.nnI always enjoy when the servers let you linger a little on a Saturday morning after youre done eating so you can sip your coffee and enjoy the day...and they definitely did that here."
1,"As a treat my husband took me to Taberna for a Christmas weekend night out.  Walking through the door the colors were warm and inviting, there was someone who came to seat us right away. They asked several times if we had a reservation, we did not.  Any size group can dine here, inside or out, great tables, chairs even sofas to sit with friends and have a drink and a small plate. They provide complimentary chips and salsa. I had the Carne Asada Rib Eye and he had the Chicken and mushroom quesadilla. We shared the plablano potatoes and I enjoyed their lusious sangria. Topping it all of with the tres leches cake,with a nice flambe marshmallow topping the cake sealed the deal we will be back."
1,"I ate at Eight!  Cool decor, great sushi, and a good location if your headed to the music factory.  All that, and its not extremely pricey.nnAs others had mentioned, the service was a little spotty.  There were only a couple people in the place and most of the staff was kind of sitting around looking bored.  I think there was some confusion on who was supposed to seat us as well.  After that though, we were promptly seated.  We were a little slow to order as most of the specialty rolls were a little different than any place around here.  It was free so, no harm done, but our waiter wasnt timely on bringing the edamame hummus and shrimp chips that other tables received as soon as they were seated.  As per the food, Ill elaborate below.nnMost of the specialty rolls had a well thought out theme to them.  The Hamachi shiso maki had yellowtail, shaved serrano peppers for heat, a little cucumber for crunch, and a shiso pesto on top.  All that with a little avocado to bring it together.  Very light flavors, but well balanced.nnThe poke roll was awesome, but it seemed more like a play on poke.  It did have some chunks of tuna on top and Im not complaining about the fact.  It also had some macadamia nuts and avocado, which is relevant.  The cherry tomatoes were a great addition as well.  But, I didnt see any green onion, nor did I even taste a hint of seasame oil or soy sauce.  Then the big ole tempura shrimp threw me way off.  The flavor of poke that I am used to just wasnt there.  All that said, it really was one of the best things I had and honestly, it would be easy to overpower the dish with sesame oil, so no harm done.nnWe ordered other things as well, the green papaya and mango salad.  I like mine a little more made for gringos.  I thought the fish sauce was overpowering and I really didnt get much mango flavor either.  We tried the QC roll too.  Good, but in no way the highlight of the evening.  All in all though it was a pretty good meal.nnOn a downside I will mention that our waiter wasnt the most pleasant and personable person Ive ever met.  I wouldnt be happy working with a place that is pretty much empty this close to the holidays either though.  The demeanor was nothing close to what some people have said in some of the bad reviews though.  I did go without water for a little while, but he was pretty attentive in general.nnBottom line is, I liked the food and Ill be back.  However, I just dont know that Charlottes downtown or all the foodies on the south side will really travel to this area for dinner unless they have other plans at the music factory as well."
1,"I love love love Stitched.nnThis little mens clothing boutique in the Cosmo hotel is very unassuming, especially when compared to the nightclublike AllSaints next door.  nnIts also very elegant, with decor reminiscent of an upscale bachelor pad, complete with leather couches and liquor cabinet.nnThe clothing selection is excellent.  Their inhouse brand offers up wonderfully tailored shirts and suits.  I adore the accessories, especially the collection of colorful silk ties that seems to go on forever.  And the hats?  To die for.nnI wasnt planning on buying clothing in Vegas, but I fell in love with the selection of Hudson jeans and couldnt say no to them.  And the prices at Stiched are actually reasonable compared to some of the other overheated Strip shops.  nnThe real highlight is the staff.  Ryan B. was infinitely helpful and patient with me while I tried on various items and acted like my typical, obnoxiously indecisive self.nnId be back to give Stitched my business anytime."
1,"This restaurant came as a breath of fresh air after my last few disappointing outings as I explore my new town.  The menu offered creative, wellprepared, and beautifully presented fare.  The ambience was excellent.  Our waitress was friendly and our food was served promptly.  nnHighly recommend for a lunch or dinner with a friend, date, or on business.  One of the most pleasant experiences Ive had in Phoenix since I moved here last month."
1,"Maybe yinzer good isnt always such a bad thing. I went here the other morning and was quoted a  minutes wait time. It took  minutes. That seemed to be pretty standard so be prepared for that. Once we got in and ordered, the food came out almost immediately making the wait time more worth it. The hot cakes were delicious but be prepared for more buttery goodness than one should consume in a month. The potatoes were also half butter. I thought they tasted great if not a tad salty. The orange juice is more affordable than in most breakfast places but it wasnt mind blowing, I doubt it was fresh squeezed. My husband ordered eggs and hash which were also good but overly salty. We left feeling stuffed, guilty, and knowing that while the food was tasty our waistlines could only handle eating there once every couple of months."
1,Not the orginial self serve yogurt but definately acceptable.nnThis place has two Southside locations.  I have never been to the smaller one by the post office.  The bigger one is nice.  Also fairly cheap.
1,"Ive been frequenting this place with my family since I was a kid and they used to be located in a hole in the wall on Flamingo and Jones. The only reason I cant give them  stars is that I went last week and they have seriously raised their prices. The food is always great. I am addicted to their beef tacos and anything covered in their enchilada sauce. Their chips, salsa and beans are always yummy too. My mom loves and hihgly suggests the green chile pork burrito, which I also think is very good and flavorful, but I would rather stick with enchilada sauce. If they would lower their prices back down some, they would easily get that th star back."
1,"CUPCAKE REVIEW I love cupcakes, I love Red Velvet, and I am SO glad I found this bakery when I visited Phoenix! I have a passion for great bakeries mainly cupcakes and I convince my bf when we are out of town that we have to try the local flavor which means cupcake searching. I bought  cupcakes Red Velvet and  Ooey Gooey. We took them back to my friends house and I ate the best red velvet cupcake I have had in awhile. The Ooey Gooey was good as well, but couldnt measure up to the Red Velvet which is my favorite cake anyways. I live in California and have tried them allSprinkles included and I wishwishwish we had a Tammie Coe here. I even have checked out there site to see about shipping but I dont know if they would be as good as they are fresh The going rate for a good cupcake is  anywhere, which these little jewels were priced at so enjoy Phoenix! And Tammie Coe Cakes are welcome anytime here is San Diego!"
1,"Really good MexicanSalvadorian food.  Simple decor, with funny Spanish TV playing.  HUGE portions, cheap prices, friendly staff.  Pupusas are off the HOOK!  I can also attest to the enchiladas, and burritos.  Also, no fee for BYO wine.  nnDocked it one star for a lessthangreat vegetarian selection, and they use some kind of Chinese veggie mix I had water chestnuts and baby corn in my enchilada  not exactly traditional, though still tasty."
1,Chatime is quickly becoming very popular spot for people who indulge in the artful drink called bubble tea or boba tea. For those that are not so sure what this is check out the description on Wikipedia. Bubble Tea for Asians is a kind of dessert refreshment or similar to Starbucks except this is tea not coffee and most drinks are cold where people come for their refreshment of choice.  Ive had Chatime in Toronto and Id concur its the most consistently excellent boba you can find at a reasonable price.  Also you can customize the level of sugar and ice which is awesome!  Selection is huge and you can go for regular size around ml or large size  ml.    nnOn my visit I went for a L Pearl Milk tea  sugar  ice with bubbles.  It was just perfect to my liking. creamy with some nice chewiness of the bubbles. nnLineups here on my visit was not as long as it is in Toronto where its ridiculous and the place has free wifi and tables for people to lounge and enjoy their BT. nnThe place is packed with students my guess Concordia and Mcgill enjoying their teas.  If I lived closer to here Id here here weekly to every other week. nnI noticed they do deliver if you have more than  drinks within .KM radius.  Pretty cool if you are lazy andor having friends over.
1,"If you are looking for mouth watering authentic Mexican food, then look no further than Popos Fiesta Del Sol Indian School locationnHands down my favorite Mexican restaurant.  This little hole in the wall eatery never lets me down.  The drinks are good and the food is delicious and authentic.nWe also use them for catering at work and get nothing but compliments on Popos days"
1,"Loved every moment of my stay here! We had an upgraded suite for the first night, bc our regular suite wasnt ready yet and I was so sad to leave....but it turns out  the regular suite was just as fabulous! Just a little less room but we didnt miss it at all. Everything from the French bathroom doors, to the gilded door handles  not a single detail was left out. We never really had much time to eat so InSuite Dining was a good friend to us the entire weekend. The wait wasnt too bad but they messed up our order a little bit each time  and at the nightly weekend rate to stay here, they should really pay attention to those little details. I guess they dont care as much since they get an automatic  gratuity  service charge or wahtever....but it wasnt a big deal. Anyway, definitely looking forward to staying here again!!!!nnTao is fun but wayyy too crowded  Ill write a separate review for them later. Tao Beach is WAY too crazy. Its like one giant mob of ugly halfnaked people lots of butter faces  you know like Wow! Nice ass! Oh...but her face.... grinding away to eurotrashy music which I actually kind of liked and everyone looks like they really shouldnt be in the sun any longer bc theyre redder than the red on the Yelp banner up above. Eek!nnRandom Lil Jon was there...looking all tiny next to his giant bodyguard. Both looked really hot  as in sweaty hot. Theyre dressed in full clothing from head to toe  black shirts and baggy jeans in  degree weather.nnWe escaped to the Venetian pools and had a much better time just relaxing in the sun, listening to the distant music of Tao Beach, sipping cocktails.nnI didnt think that any hotel would measure up to the Bellagio, but apparently I was wrong  Also, the Venetian has a younger clientele  much more fun than Bellagios stuffy older crowd."
1,"In most cities where I spend a good amount of time, I have my preferred home away from home Citizen M in Glasgow,  The Calls in Leeds, and The Velvet Hotel in Manchester. Ive had the damnedest time trying to find that right mix of uniqueness, convenience, and affordability to settle on any one hotel in Edinburgh, however. I feel a little bit like a gypsy each time I visit.nnThough I may need another stay or two to confirm, I might have found what Ive been looking for in The George.nnThings started off somewhat grim when I attempted to check in my first night. I arrived to a queue of a halfdozen people in front of me, some stressedlooking receptionists, and a growing line of other impatient wouldbe guests behind me. It wasnt until one intrepid porter brought out a large bowl of ice, two bottles of prosecco, and started handing out flutes of bubbly to everyone that the mood of the room turned from sour to notquitewarm. Honestly, it was a brilliant touch of customer service wizardry if Ive ever seen one!nnRooms here are reasonably well appointed with comfortable beds and linens, a radiator for heating, updated bathroom fixtures, and quality bath products. Even the office desk and chair made for a pleasant working environment. Whats even better is that my room at the end of a hallway was dead quiet unless someone was directly outside the door, I couldnt hear a single noise.nnMy one major gripe much like many other hotels in Europe is the lack of free wifi, or in this case... any wifi at all. Seriously, its . Cant we look into some basic technology infrastructure improvements? Instead, the only available internet option is via ethernet at the price of ua for a  hour period.  If theres any one single hotel pet peeve I have, its a la carte internet charges. Just lump them into the room costs across the board! Please!nnAll told, by booking online, the discounted rates at The George are quite reasonable, so the cost of getting online is effectively a wash. When staying in New Town near Edinburghs city centre, this easily ranks at the top of my list for cost and quality."
1,"Just had an oil change and a tire rotation done and it was great friendly service.nnI was referred by a friend and I am glad he referred me.  Seems like a great shop to get some basic work done at, with good service and good rates."
1,"I come here most mornings for breakfast as I work overnights and compared to some of the other IHOPs, I have been to, this one is awesome! I always have fast friendly service  granted its not to busy at  am the servings are always good size and freshly cooked doesnt taste like microwave food, like with other late niteearly morning restaurants. Their hot chocolate is great too."
1,"This cafe is super cute. Its located in the Paris Hotel and carries a wide variety of fancy desserts. They are all delicious and beautifully decorated. They also have pastries, coffee, and sandwiches. Its a great spot to check out if you want a simple lunch or an afternoon snack while youre in vegas and dont want to break the bank. An americano and a proscuitto sandwich on a baguette cost around .nnThey also sell merchandise in the back of their store like cups, cookbooks, aprons some which are paris themed which make it all that much more adorable."
1,"Stylist   STARS.......Salon   stars... Average  starsnnThis review is for the Robert Cromeans Salon located on the Beach level at Mandalay Bay NOT the walk In Salon. nnBased on my stylist Suzanna I would have given the salon a  star rating, but like someone else said, I only gave it a  star rating because of the salon itself. It is in DESPERATE need of an overhaul. Its not that its dirty, it just looks like it hasnt had ANYTHING done to it for years. Seeing how this is the more expensive of the  Robert Cromeans salons at Mandalay Bay I would think it should be pristine condition. Its not!!!!nnNow on to the good stuff. My stylist was Suzanna and she was absolutely amazing. I havent cut my hair for like  years so my hair was down to my waist, long, boring, lifeless with boring flat color. I wanted to get it all cut off into an aline bob and really blonde, which deep inside I was scared to do because the last time I attempted to get a bob I ended up with a stacked bob in the back and I hated it.nnI told Suzanna my concerns, she suggested I not go all the way to platinum yet since I had always used boxed color and she wanted to make sure my hair would come out right. Instead she used a combination of blondes and I couldnt be happier. And the cut? Absolutely perfect. nnIve had my hair cut before that looked good out of the salon but not so good after I washed and styled it at home. Today I decided I would wash it and not do anything to it just to see and it still looks good. I could literally wash it and leave the house wet and be confident that it will look good when it dries.nnAs for the rest of the staff.....everyone was nice. I had an overall pleasant experience despite the outdated look of the salon.nnI will definitely be back to see Suzanna."
1,"One of my favorite music venues! The stage is great, most of the time theyre free, and the acts they book are fantastic. I used to live in Madison and have spent countless of hours studying at the memorial union and union south. Plenty of comfortable seats and the setts veggie burgers are delicious! Every time Im in Madison I always check for upcoming shows here."
1,"I really like MOD Pizza, plus the staff is incredibly nice! Okay, a Chipotlestyle pizza joint in Gilbert?! Sign me up!nnI love that you get to choose whatever you want and the prices are ridiculous for a pretty good sized pizza. The ingredients are always fresh, theyre constantly changing things up on the recommended menu, and they even offer glutenfree crust, which isnt always the case for trendy pizza joints.nnWhen they get busy, I can see how things can get a little wonky with getting the right pizza out to the right customer  I ordered a pizza, but they accidentally gave it to someone else with a similar pizza. I ended up getting a replacement pizza immediately, plus they gave me a coupon for  FREE pizzas the next time I came in! Great customer service!nn  stars for the service, staff, and quality  tastiness of the food. n Minus a star for their deliveryoutput system."
1,"We used Get Your Move On for a local move back in . I was recently asked for a recommendation for movers and remembered how happy I was with their services and wanted to make sure that I put my review out there.nnI contacted Get Your Move On a little late in the game. They were one of the only moving companies who had an opening in the week I wanted to move in May, and I ended up taking a day off work to move that day since we had few options left. The quote was consistent with what we ended up paying. The movers were tied up with a job prior to mine that took much longer than expected which happens in this industry I learned, and I received a call from someone at the company ensuring me that the move would still be completed that day and that he needed to pull a different team together to complete my move. nnThe movers were professional and very hard working. They were friendly and clearly knew what they were doing. I was about six months pregnant at the time, so there wasnt much that I was able to do, and they helped with packing up the wardrobe boxes that I wasnt able to pack myself before they arrived. When we arrived at the new location, we were surprised to find that the AC was broken and it was HOT out. The movers didnt complain and did a great job getting everything inside and where I wanted it as quickly as possible. I made sure to provide them with water and a well deserved tip. I hope that I wont be moving any time soon, but when if and I do, I wouldnt hesitate to contact Get Your Move On again."
1,"I dont remember how we found this place, but I seem to recall hearing at one point that it was the place to go for beer. I guess that depends on what youre looking for, but for me, I disagree. The beer was good, the ambience was nice, but the drink menu was a little short for me. They have a fair number of house beers and a few others some microbrews and some imports, and the waitstaff was pleasant if not all that fast. I would go backthe extra blonde was deliciousbut I wouldnt make this my goto place for new beer.  All in, a solid hang out, but I wont be a regular."

STILL NO BEER! nnMenu  I want to try their Sundae with the deep fried oreos and their chili cheese curly fries P teeheennI gave it a  because its Serendipity! LOL ... i will go back everytime im in Vegas im just not getting the frozen hot chocolate again LOL"
1,"Whenever I need an outfit to go out or anywhere really, I look here first! Why? Because its just a few minutes away from where I live and its cheap! Plus, going all the way out to a mall can seem like a hassle. This store is usually a hit or miss for me but they do seem to add new items on the sales floor on most days, if not every day. So you will find a lot of new items a few days later. Ill admit ive shopped here a couple times a week when I was bored. nnThe floor set is always color coded. Definitely makes it easier when youre looking for a specific look! Shoes are placed throughout the store but mostly in the back left corner. You usually have to flag an employee down if you want to try on shoes in your size. Jewelry is in front of the cash registers in the back. The fitting rooms are in the back right. Theyre clean and big with a huge mirror. They do have a limit of just  items in the fitting room but I noticed if you come during nonpeak hours, there isnt someone working in the fitting room so you can bring in as many as you want. The clothes here are very cheap. Dont expect much, you get what you paid for. I still have some of the things ive bought there but Ive also had some become unwearable. Dont expect great customer service either! The employees are either handling the fitting room, cashiering, or doing go backs. That is it. However, one day I noticed there was one employee making an effort to talk to customers. At least someone is trying to do their job.nnEven with the fact the clothes are made with cheap material and they have bad customer service, this store still gets a good amount of foot traffic! There are always a lot of customers here so they must be doing something right."
1,"I dont know who is paying  a person, who had dry turkey, or whatever, but I just went there less than a week ago and I paid ish for my lunch and it was AMAZING! They had everything from terriyaki flank steak sooo tender! to pesto mashed potatoes, to sweet potatoes with some kind of fruit juice pineapple juice maybe? very creative and unique! and yummy!! to pesto mozzarella balls with walnuts and cranberries... there was sushi, crab legs, fresh chilled shrimp, mushroom ravioli with truffle cream sauce... it was amazing.  The cheesecake was the best cheesecake Ive ever had.  They had a crunchy coffee tiramisu dessert thing that was phenomenal.  It was all wonderful.  The coffee, even, was delicious.  I was very, very happy with my experience there and will DEFINITELY be going back on my next visit to Vegas.  I loved it!  Oh, I probably wouldnt go there for brunch on Sunday because it is  or  bucks and I think one of the reasons Im so happy about my experience is because the food was incredible and ! Which is pretty close in rate to the other buffets in town some of which should be ashamed of themselves!."
1,"I had the pleasure of going to Mon Ami Gabi for Mothers Day ,what a delicious lunch,try one of their salads.On such a busy day we still received great service  our meal came quickly which we appreciated as small children were with us. nThis is a fun place to eat with great views of the strip. nPenny Z"
1,"Great gelato in Chandler.  Although there arent many flavors to choose from, the ones he has are great.  The  flavors I tried were all a home run with me.  I havent tried anything other than gelato, but I plan on going back.  nnEnzo happened to be serving us and he was a pleasure to speak with.  He is one heck of a nice guy.  This is the kind of business I would rather support. Ciao!"
1,"There are really only two things you need to know about the Foundation Roomnn. Its on the roof of Mandalay Bay, and has an EXCELLENT view of the Strip.n. Scantily clad dancers  in bustiers, fishnets, cheekie panties  heels. HEAVENLY.nnThe drinks were pretty good, too. The bartenders were friendly and quick, and a bit heavy handed. nnAll in all, its a pretty place!"
1,"This club is spectacular.  It is very large, and offers all sorts of music.  We get a table and bottle service  bottles every time we come here for three reasons  . You skip the insanely long line outside, and form in a much smaller table line . You get a place to sit down and catch a breather . The security keeps people that shouldnt be in your areatable out, and they escort overly drunk people out as well so they dont ruin your experience.  Heck, for a nominal fee we get a sanctuary in one of the hottest party spots in Vegas?  All  good!nnTable servicenIt is what you would expect.  Book early, tip well, and you may find yourself upgraded to a really awesome table inside the main floor.  Or you can opt for cheaper tables outside in the pool areas, etc.  Be sure to tip the person in charge of security in your area so that you can count on them keeping an eye on your stuff! Be careful with the upgrades though because sometimes they will stick you in a TINY table in a better location.  The last time we went we figured we would try it out, and we had mixed feelings about the super cramped spot.  Much better view and right in the heart of the club, but only  people could sit at a time of our  person group.  We had a  person table outside...nnExperiencenIt is a really safe place.  I have never seen a fight break out there, or anyone too obnoxiously drunk causing trouble.  It is more of a high end hang out spot.  Everything here is extremely overpricedexpensive so be prepared for that.  nnConclusionnWorth visiting at least once.  I will probably go again next year."
1,"Im not really into ice cream as much as some people but this place is seriously good.  Its on two floors with an ice cream parlour on the ground floor and a cafe above it.  I came here with two friends and we sat upstairs after about a ten minute wait for a table  testament to how popular the gelataria is.  The menu had the normal flavours of ice cream like vanilla, strawberry, chocolate but also more exotic ones like champagne and kiwi fruit.  nThey let you choose either three or five scoops of any flavour of your choice and theres all kinds of sauces on offer to go with it.  It costs about ua and the scoops which they give you are a decent size which are the perfect antidote to a heat of a warm summers day.  nAs a cafe its very pricey and I would only really recommend coming here for the ice cream which is definitely its major selling point."
1,"The Queens Arms recently had a bit of a revamp and the place is looking rather good  it has definitely joined the ranks of decent gastropubs and left the days of being a traditional boozer behind. The newly painted green exterior is inviting and I was pleasantly surprised when I stepped over the threshold inside its cosy due to the presence of a real fire and the books lining one of the walls are a nice touch. The menu is tempting and succinct there are only a couple of choices for each course, so everything is well thought out, pleasantly presented and very tasty try the fish and chips. My boyfriend is rather fussy when it comes to pubs, but this is somewhere that has us both satisfied its gastro enough for me and pubby enough for him."
1,"Brandnew Old Montreal Italian osteria specializing in pasta dishes of all sorts at a reasonable price.  nnIve only visited Venti for a special occasion with chef Sara Jenkins Porchetta, Porsena, NYC during their first week of operation, so I havent gotten a full sense of chef Michele Forgiones talents in the kitchen and the service was still a little rough around the edges.  But, that said, the menu looks great, theyre one of the only restaurants in Montreal with a pasta extruder meaning they can make dried pasta in a range of finicky shapes like strozzapreti!, in addition to making fresh pasta, and they appear to have a strong team in the kitchen two of the featured pasta dishes that nightartichokes, sweetbreads, mint, and tagliatelle  strozzapreti with lamb sausage and mustard greenswere perfectly executed and rank among the best Ive had anywhere."
1,"Im honestly TRYING to think of a reason I should possibly take off a star, and I cant find one. Ive never been inside but my husband and I order delivery from this place all the time and each time our food is delivered quickly, hot, fresh, and delicious with friendly service. nnThe very first time we ever ordered from here, they got our address wrong and ended up in Henderson. When they finally figured out what had happened, they called us immediately to apologize and let us know that the delivery driver was returning to the restaurant to pick up a fresh batch of food for us. We understood the mistake so we were not angry and were actually just happy that they were keeping us informed.

Weve been loyal customers ever since.nnExcellent food  great customer service   stars"
1,"Another amazing experience at one of Michael Minas establishments. nnFirst course nnCaviar parfait   I would say that this is one of his signature dishes. Layers of flavor with a lot of depth. nnSecond course nnHamachi  the fresh fish really cut through the richness of the yuzu aioli. I thought the dish was well balanced. nnThird course nnJapanese a steak  the marbling on the cut really made the meat melt in my mouth. For you carnivores and steak conoussiers this cut is a must havennDessert  got the dessert trio. At this point I was full and all I can remember of the trio was a root beer float ,cookies ,and a pana cotta. Delicious!nnService  Ive had a lot of fine dining experiences in my lifetime and all I can say is from the host to the managers, the  entire staff was very attentive and accommodating. As we walked out all staff members acknowledged us and thanked us for coming in. nnOur server Miguel was awesome, his positive energy really made our dinner that much more special. He was very knowledgable of the menu and answered any questions we had regarding the menu.nHe even walked us out. nnI was very pleased with my experience at Michael Mina. I will be back!"
1,The food here was excellent and on a thursday night no waiting. The brussel sprouts starter was superb but beware the mains to share were barely enough for !!!!nnWe ordered the Chicken Waffles to share and it was  pieces of chicken and  small waffles. Desert menu was only  items. Price for  with tip
1,"Reasonably priced offthestrip familyowned Italian restaurant.  Its an oldfashioned cozy  quiet place with a small bar.  Dining room is romantically lit and divided from the bar by a wall rack of bottled wine.  Meals are homemade and prepared fresh to order.   We were offered  thoroughly enjoyed a red Malbec grape Argentinian wine with our meal.nWe were in a large group so we got to sample most of the appetizers.  The stuffed mushrooms and the calamari were delicious.  I also liked the antipasta and mussels.  I had the raviolis. My friends really enjoyed the lasagna. The tiramisu was better than the Italian cheesecake.nService was attentive and professional, so dont be afraid to bring a date or business guest.  You wont be disappointed and the pocketbook wont go broke.nThe owner is from Argentina and is a jolly young man making the American dream come true by opening a restaurant in the USA in  circa.  Why Las Vegas?  Because he spent his honeymoon in Sin City and loved the town.  I know this because he drove me back to my hotel in his own car! We were in a large group and he was concerned that we were waiting to long for a cab.  Who does that?!  Someone who really cares about his customers! He got an extra star for the ride home.  Lol"
1,"Great, authentic Thai food in the heart of Phoenix. They are always packed which is a true testament to their food! The service is always exceptional as well. The only downside is DDD was just there last week so expect a much longer wait once the episode airs!"
1,"Sitting at the counter at FnB is an experience that should be had, period. Our reservations by default was later on in the evening, but also turned out to be quite fortuitous. Not only were we able to see chefs Badman and Curry in action, but also saw them turn down the kitchen towards the end of the night. It is a display that even the most advent epicurean is not often exposed to. There are no doors or walls to hide behind. Everything that you eventually place in your mouth is out in the open and also in the way it is prepared  from the raw, to the stove, to the plate. nnImpressive was also how fluid the kitchen moved with only the two chefs preparing dishes. Chef Curry preparing the appetizers, fish and fowl while Chef Badman shoveled coal onto a grill and simultaneously manning it to ensure ribeyes were cooked to order. nnThe ambiance was the type youd expect when invited into anothers kitchen, and the food tasted as if given the same attention. So to the service. Our waitress, Chantelle was nice about explaining everything to us after hearing that it was our first time there. When she found out we had moved just a few months ago, she was kind enough to write down her restaurant recommendations for us too. nnWill definitely be back to try other items off their everevolving menu. Reservation for two please. Yes its okay if its at the counter and yes, its fine if its late."
1,"After a few disappointing dining experiences in Vegas, we went to Nobu on the last night of our trip.  We were NOT disappointed.  We ordered the Omakase literally means I leave it to you, which is a fixed price meal prepared as the chef decides.  It began with sushi not americanized sushi with crazy sauces that was incredible. Simple, but complex flavors, elegantly prepared.  We moved on to Nobus famous miso black cod. Every bite was exquisite.  We moved on to the beef course, which was also incredible, before dessert.  nnIf youre a sushi fan, this is the ultimate destination."
1,While visiting Edinburgh I went to Mums to try the traditional Scottish food haggis for the first time in my life. I had heard good things about the place and I was not disappointed. Mums is a small local eatery with a very friendly staff and good food at very reasonable prices. The next time Im in Edinburgh I plan to go here for breakfast.
1,"Kim, our server was great. Drinks stayed full and she was atentive without hovering. The restaurant was busy but not overly so and we were seated without a reservation right away. We sarted with calamari which tasted very fresh, but could have ised more seasoning, i added tobasco to mine and it was great  then we had veal scallopini which was really good but I would have preferred a tomato based sauce. To finish up we had coconut cream pie."
1,Ok I am sooooo pleased with Ingos! And so full lol ! nThe shattered potatoes shattered my diet and so did the tasty greyhound. The veggie burger is one of the best I ever had. Service was friendly and attentive. Great location I really liked the outdoor seating. BTW there are free chocolate chip cookies inside .nLove it.
1,"Went there for mini date. Had the sea bass I believe. Boyfriend had the steak Thai noodle. The best dish ever! Even better than mines and it wasnt bad for  bucks. But there menu doesnt have much, they couldnt make me a sex on the beach"
1,"My parents, BF and I stayed here over Labor Day weekend. My mom had stayed here previously and loved it. Its a very nice, well kept hotel, but I was a little let down because I LOVE Red Rock and was hoping for the same. While Red Rock is all modern and chic, Green Valley is going for more of a French countryside theme  as can be witnessed by their mini vineyard and antique replicas. nnThe rooms were very nice and comfortable and I thought the housekeepers did an outstanding job. I love the turndown service and how they bring you bottles of water and ice at night. I know, no one comes to Vegas to watch TV, but they could update their rooms a little with flat screens. It would make the room seem even more spacious. nnI took my bf to the spa for a couples massage for his birthday present. The spa is super nice and luxurious. They have a private lap pool and indoor jacuzzi for spa guests. We also spent sometime at the regular pool. It was a little on the small side, but I really like the cushioned lounges. nnAs for the casion, the Bf loved the fact that they had  blackjack and I liked that even though it was Labor Day, there were tons of slot machines to choose from. Too bad none of them gave me the jackpot! I would gladly come back to Green Valley anytime, especially if someone else is paying!"
1,Never in my life have I seen this much memorabilia in one place. Its like walking through Gene Summons office if he were an MM.nnSo many things from dollscandy machines and bottlestoys and of course lots and lots of the small flat chocolate circles we all know as MMs.nnThis is a must see for tourist who love chocolate. There are so many things to see. Not just to buy but to look at. Simply amazing.nnI had a ball. Or several hundred flat chocolate circles.
1,"Im not much of a shoppervisitor to The Promenade, but there are plenty of nice eateries, places to shop, hang out, and relax. BTs opened their second location here on the corner of one of the strips and seems to be a nice addition to the burger scene in Crown Town. Though I see some hiccups, bottlenecks, and negatives, this place serves up some comparable fare for those craving one of Americas favorites foods between two slices of bread.nnWe made it in for a late lunch on Sunday afternoon. The interior is almost a curved shape with the main line funneling down the center of the restaurant. This is one of the biggest losses. It doesnt utilize the space well and tends to create an odd line that blocks walkways for the rest of the restaurant traffic and staff. I think this can be circumvented easily, however. The staff is awesome, thoughtful, and kind. Very nice people all around. nnAgain, it was busy, but it did take over  minutes for our food to be brought to our table two salads and two burgers. Not the biggest deal in the world. I was just really hungry, haha. nnI ordered the custom salad. Spinachice berg, jalepenos, black beans, shrooms, carrots, chickpeas, a veggie burger for protein and the balsamic. The salad, although delicious, was so skimpy. A cereal sized bowl and definitely not worth the price. If it were even  larger, it would be worth it. I was just craving a bit more of the additional veggies and would have loved to have seen more in the bowl...and a larger bowl at that. nnThough I cannot comment on the burgers, they look absolutely fantastic. The care that is taken is evident and their product really does look amazing. Looking forward to coming back fora burger...or three!nnBIG BONUS! They have a  challenge! oz burger in  minutes. I cant WAIT to try this!"

1,"I like this place for the lunch specials.  I tend to the get the teriyaki chicken, beef and rice combo.  Starts with the miso soup and the lunch includes salad, rice and a California  roll. Ive ordered their specialty rolls and they were good but I think the pricing on those is a little high.  Service is good but get here early because its very small and fills up quickly for lunch."
1,"I have to say the service here is superb and keeps me coming back for more. If you enjoy great beer and good food you will love this place.  The environment is upbeat and lively.  If youre not a fan of noise though might not be the place for you, personally I love it"
1,This place has the best PHO on the west side   And they are know for their egg rolls.  My parents actually found this Vietnamese gem.  The staff is very nice and the food is cheap.  Always a great sunday lunch with the family!
1,"The name New York Pizza conjures up a predictable image in the heads of most people, and to those lucky enough, an intense and blissful memory.  This kind of pizza, large, floppy and often sold by the slice has been imitated in one way or another in every corner of the country to mixed results.  nnBut there is another sort of New York pizza that predates the style most New Yorkers included are familiar with. Its the kind of pizza made in a small handful of ancient pizzerias in New York city like Lomardis, Grimaldis and Totonos. Its thin crusted with a sweet tomato sauce and a dusting of parmesan andor romano, some dried oregano and fresh basil and a generous drizzle of olive oil. Mozzarella is used sparingly, about half as much as youd expect. This is the style of the very first pizzas made in America by Neapolitan immigrants.  The distinguishing factor today is the oncecommon coalfired brick oven running about  degrees thats capable of charring the crust before it browns the cheese.  The result is a striking palette of black, light brown, white, dark green and about five shades of red.nnIve never been to Grimaldis in Brooklyn, but I have been to Totonos. And this style, the socalled New York Neapolitan, was one I thought I could only score in NYC.  Through the magic of Yelp, I found this improbable outpost while looking for a hasslefree, off the strip locale for a family dinner. Problem is, I talk too much and felt the need to find a real gem.  This couldnt have been easier.  I was shocked to see that NYCs favorite pizzeria had franchised, but this looks like a small chain run by a nephew of the original owner, with his blessings, assistance and recipes.  nnWe were quickly seated through the help of a callahead quasireservation at the best table in the house, right next to the pizza prep station.  The pies were nearly flawless.  I went with extra basil and I sampled the pepperoni and sausage. There were six of us, all northeast natives, two of which have lived in Italy, and all of us ranked this as our favorite or nearfavorite pizza ever.  Is it my favorite?  Im not sure, but its nd or third at worst.  It has to be the best in Vegas and it will be a mandatory stop every time Im in town.nnThey dont have a line out the door yet, so check it out before the word spreads.  Service is attentive and polite, which isnt very East Coast of them, but thats one part of back home that I dont miss. Five motherfn stars."

The customer service was wonderful!

1,I dont get to go very often but their Happy hours are well worth it. The food is bursting with flavor and always great with presentation. You cant go wrong..Its not pretentious but I suggest you up your game a bit in clothing department...after all its not Giligins. Great for a girls night out or a HH with coworkers.
1,"This review is for the Boba This Boba tastes excellent and is the best that I have had in this town so far, it does not taste powdered or overcooked. The service is friendly and I didnt feel unwanted being white"
1,I accidentally knocked my friends iphone s out of her hand and shattered the screen. Took it to Quick Fix the next day and they fixed it while we enjoyed some coffee at Coffee Rush. In less than  minutes they were done and the phone was as good as new. For a super reasonable price as well. I would recommend this place to anybody.
1,"It seems every single time I walk into this store, I get the best service.  It could possibly be because the employees see this teeny Asian girl struggling with a gargantuan  pound pile of clothing.  Anywho, the employees of the Las Vegas Topshop store approach me quickly and take all of my clothing to the personal shopping section of the store.  This section is separated from the other normal fitting rooms and it comes with its own private cashier.  Very awesome!  I take my time in the store, and constantly add to my already gigantic pile of things to try on.  They also never provide a limit to how many things I can bring into the fitting room, unlike most stores who have a meager limit of  or  things allowed.  I do tend to blow my load in this store, so the employees are always friendly and helpful.    One of my alltime favorite stores to shop in!"
1,"My husband and I walked in for a late lunch while staying at the Renassaince across the street. When we walked in the were some gentlemen at the bar who looked like regulars out of a gangster movie. My husbands cesaer was great as was my mixed greens salad. I had a crabcake sandwich with shoestring fries. I was quite impressed because it was almost entirely crab! I wish I could remember what my husband had a lemon chicken dish and loved it. I ordered a shiraz that was ok... I wish they had more wines by the glass as I am a little snobby when it comes to wine. Our server, Kris, was sweet. I would like to try dinner there on our next trip."

I needed to stay a few days while my permanent corporate rental was set up. nice room with all new furnishings AND a great comfy bed plus ICE COLD AC THAT YOU CONTROL makes a difference when it is  degrees out. nnPrices range from  during summer months to  or higher in winter months internet bookings. nnOn my last stay, I was bone tired, it was late at night and I left my expensive customized briefcase on top of my truck while unloading etc.nnI didnt notice it missing until I checked out a few days later. A fellow guest turned it in and staff tracked it down in lost and found, so staff is honest too, unbelievable. nnBriefcase also contained some docs that while I didnt need at the moment would have been arduous to replace so i got the bonus round too.nnYou cant go wrong for a easy short term stay at a great value and honest staff.

1,"Grilled Octopus with spicy lemoncello has savory, brightness, little sweetness, and balance. The brown crust has an initial sweet flavor, then you bite into the octopus and you get savory and brightness, then when you think it can become too rich or spicy, you have some of the trio of beans that brings balance. The pickled relish under lying helped the flavors as well as the bit of mint leaf. The server Ian was very helpful and his team was On It!nnI had the   inch thick pork chop! the chop was cooked perfectly even and the slightly charred fat was sooo tasty! This berkshired pig was fricken good, and Ians recommendation of wine pairing was spot on....yeah I said spot on...nnOnly down fall was the tiramisu, but Ian quickly exchanged it with a smooth chocolate Gelato!

1,"Just went last night...Great! We sat at the sushi bar where you can watch the guys slicin n dicin. I ordered the Udon noodles and chicken. SO good.

1,"New England clam chowder is one of my all time favorites and yesterday I stopped by the Yard House in Town Square and ordered a cup of chowder and wings. I immediately regretted my decision, since the last time I went to the Yard House in Summerlin the chowder was watery, had very little flavor and was not good. Instead of canceling my order I figured Id try it since I was at a different location. Wow! I was pleasantly surprised to have the most fantastic New England clam chowder I have had since the East coast. It was the perfect consistency and loaded with flavorful clams. I definitely got my moneys worth. The service was excellent, as they bought my glass of wine since there was a minimal delay in my drink order. A delay I barely noticed, but I did make a point of telling them to call the chef in Summerlin and teach him how to make clam chowder."

1,My wife and I go for reflexology every year we come to the metro area. This place offers a good value for  people. the only thing that was different at Oriental Foot Spa was the masseuses would leave for several minutes between transitioning from your body massage to your foot massage. Kind of stops the flow that you want from a massage.

1,"We are regulars at this place and its amazing!!!! The creamy jalapeufo is sooo good, even my kids love it. The big as your face beef fajita burrito with boom boom sauce on it is one of our favorites. The fajitas are also wonderful. The Mexican and Texas martinis are awesome!"
1,"My husband and I went there for dinner. It was great!nTo start they amused my bouche  with a yummy mushroom thing and pea soup. nWe ordered two appetizers the crazy lobster thing which was messy but they brought out wet towels to clean our fingers and fresh napkins.nThe other appetizer we ordered was the scallops. Two potato pancakes topped with scallop, thinly sliced chirizo, perfectly cooked quails egg topped off with a lobster foam...It was delicious.nMy husband ordered the rack of lamb and he ate every bit of it. I ordered the halibut. Very large portion of fish and it came with these amazing lobster dumplings. nFor dessert we had the cheesecake lollipop tree. It did come with the bubblegum whip cream. Oddly enough the whip cream brings out the flavors of the cheesecake. The waiter told us that they are the only thing that is not made in house. They are handmade in France, individually wrapped, and shipped to them. Well worth the hassle.nnSo honestly the coolest thing is they bring out cotton candy with your check! I asked them for a box so I could walk with it. It was delicious."
1,"The biodome is great fun for kids and kids at heart.  Think of it like an indoor zoo, but more awesome... if zoos arent your thing though, steer clear.  It has four distinct sections, which are created to imitate the natural ecosystem.  So the rainforest is hot and muggy while the laurent forest is a nice comfortable fall temperature.  The antarctic section is behind glass, which is kind of sad, Id rather be cold than try and take pictures of the adorable penguins through glass.  While its not large as far as zoos go, it was a unique experience, and one Id go see again.nnIm only sad because the otters were asleep"
1,"I disagree with  Fred M., I think the burgers are very good and wonder why people go into the Mc Ds instead?!  They have a greater variety of burgers, chicken sandwiches, wings, fries, chili fries, milkshakes etc. And you get better tasting food and more of it for your money and they have a value menu and  for  and  for  deals that will fill you up.nnId eat Rallys food any day over Mc Donalds, Burger King, In n Out Burgers or Arbys if there were only more Rallys Hamburger places around.nnThe only draw back is there is only outside seating and drive through service, but with good November weather like I had when I went sitting outside under an umbrella table was just fine."
1,"Talk about fine dining. This place takes the cake. The food is quite expensive. But none of that matters when your turning the big  does it? Me and my date started off with a few martinis. I didnt see beer on the menu. So why not. They waiter brought us over a selection of various fresh bread. Not so fresh but still good.nnWe first started with a mint pea soup. Cold, and different. But it was very good. Then moved on to the lobster salad. Served cold of course. Not very much flavor. But it did the job. From there my date ordered the foie gras. I had the sea bass. Both dishes were very excellent. Mind you, that was the very first time I tried foie gras. Different yet satisfying. nnTo finish up the meal. They brought me a vanilla suflet . With a scoop of vanilla ice creme, and vanilla topping. With happy birthday written all over it. I gotta say it was the little things that impressed me with this restaurant. Me and date were sat by the glass windows. Able to view the fountain show. Every time I got up to use the restroom. A fresh napkin was laid out for me. The flaws were far and few. The size of the restaurant is rather small. Not to mention that the waiters are rather slow. But other than that. Everything went smoothly."

1,"The only reason why I went to this place is bc of the great YELP reviews. Now I know why. I got my last car tinted by another popular LV company and was going to return to them for my new car until I read the reviews for Precision. The ownerI think Brian was super cool and he had no issue tinting my back Fiat  windows which the dealership warned not to get done bc of possibly shattering.nBrian had no problem with them and on the day of my appointment he gave me a ride to the mall so I didnt have to sit at the shop. The dealership quoted me a cheaper price but my intuition kicked in and I didnt think Id be happy. I liked Precisions recommendation and customer service that if anything went wrong come and see him and hed take care of it. I recommended this company to my sister and anyone else who wants top service.nBrian is professional, amazingly friendly, and super cute too!"
1,"The Wynn is currently at the top of my list of the best hotels in Vegas. Ive been writing reviews for hotels in Vegas recently, and the Wynn stands out.nnMy stay was excellent. Upon entering my room, I had to just stand there and take the scene in. The room was decorated lavishly. Everything about it just worked. The bathrooms were luxurious. The beds were luxurious. The room was excellent. Period.nnI definitely want to come back whenever Im in Vegas, especially to try the much raved about Wynn Buffet. So far though, the Wynn is overall a really great hotel."
1,I had been here one other time before this last time and I know why I went back. We were seated right away on a Saturday night at pm and there were four in out party. We got an awesome table outside with a great view of the strip. The sushi was very fresh and they have a great selection of sake. For being Vegas I was really surprised how cheap our meal was. I cant wait to eat here again next time I am in Vegas!
1,Ambiance fun but a little dark. I was very happy that they placed us next to a window so that the sun could filter in.nnWild Mushroom Pizza was a bit of a disappointment as the mushrooms appeared the standard grocery store variety.
1,"Let me just say WOW!!! How have I only just now been to this place? If you love Greek food, look no further.nnWe stopped in today for a quick bite to eat and were not disappointed. You know how I love lists, so here is a list of the things that we loved about this placen. Easily the best gyro meat we have ever had. Flavorful. Tender. The ideal texture. Just. Muah! kissing motionn. The friessalad were also awesome. Taaaaasty sides.n. Generous portions. Holy cow, the gyros were gyronormous! I almost had to use a fork!n. The tzaztiki I am butchering the spelling of that word is out of this world. It, like the meat, has incredible flavor and texture not too much dill flavorvery creamynot too thin. Ill take a bucket togo, please.n. There are  red and green bell peppers on the Gyro Supreme. YUM! n. Cheap. Cheap. Cheap. The prices at the place are ridiculous in a good way, considering the caliber of the food you receive. We paid less than  for two of us. Cant go wrong with prices like that.n. Family ownedlocal business. We were able to meet the owner George. Loved that!n. The decor. This tiny little hole in the wall place has really adorable styling inside. n. Free drink when you check in on Yelp.n. Only  minutes from the house.nnAll in all, this discovery was a complete win. While we were there, Rob the boyfriend actually used the word outkingstanding!. Seriously. That good.nnWe will be back ASAP! Thank you, George!"
1,"I had some really cool conversations in this hostel.nAnd it has excellent amenities.nFirst hostel with nice countertops Ive ever seen.nIt is probably physically the nicest hostel Ive ever stayed in. nnPhoenix seems like a pretty laid back place. nAs one of the hostel workers put it We hang out a lot here.nI didnt really talk with Amber but her and her friends were around and definitely very social and friendly. nnThis hostel would totally work for you if you like chilling out in the sun andor drinking. Actually, it would probably even be cool for a hostelling staycation. nnThings relatively near herenA gas stationnA Chipotleburritos, etc.nZoes grilled pimento cheese, spinach rolls this stuff was goodnThe little bar the hostel peeps seem to like  hanging out at. nnThings near but sort of far unless you have a carnSafeway groceriesnCVS pharmacy thingsnnThings I did while I was herenDesert Botantical Garden gorgeous!nMusical Instrument Museum coolest museum Ive been to in my life!nShopped at Mercado Mexico Mexican importsnShopped at House of Rice Japanese imports, origami paper and panasian food suppliesnnThings I cant comment onnPublic transport I didnt take it and rented a car at my friends suggestion, since I wanted to visit the PHX suburbs. nnThings I can comment onnI didnt fall off the top bunk. And generally prefer them since, idk, didnt everyone want top bunk as a kid? But, these bunks have no guard rails.nnWeird shit that isnt really directly relate to the hostelnThere were a lot of guys here. Maybe it was just my week or whatever. But, seriously backpacking ladies come and even this dynamic out!nn Guys on backpacking trails are often only looking for two things alcohol and easy american women as two guys in this hostel just so happened to tell me quite freely. But, ugh. Bored dudes in the desert, no bueno. nnSo, in short, facilities gorgeous. But, probably not the right place or week for me. nI guess I wonder what the general demographic is that makes it down to Phoenix.nn The city itself was a pretty cool sprawling mass though. Definitely growing and new."
1,"First visit we ended up leaving because what was supposed to be a  minute wait turned into a  minute wait and we had a show to get to....but Im SO glad we went back another time.nnFood portions are HUGE so dont be shy about sharing a meal or even just an appetizer cuz DAHYUM you get a lot of food. Love the drinks in mason jars too. Now thats the right way to drink sweet tea!nnAnd the food was excellent. In fact, the biscuits and apple butter could easily be dessert...or a meal on their own. WOW. Super yum! nnOur server Bethany was terrific. She kept our drinks full, was very personable, and had great suggestions without being intrusive. I will definitely be backand am looking forward to those biscuits and apple butter very soon!"
1,"Pretty good vintage store with great prices.  Im not a fan of vintage clothing myself, but my fiancee absolutely loves it and she had a ball shopping here.nnTheyve got a combination of actual vintage items and vintagestyle items, but once again the one thing I noticed was the big selection of items plus the pricing vintage stores in Atlanta or pretty much anywhere else will drain your wallet more than designer clothes.  Not here.nnIts in a pretty cool little neighborhood with a couple of other shops, but this one is far and away the best.  If youre in or around Charlotte and want to get some vintage pieces, check it out  you wont be disappointed."
1,"My drama queen dog giving me panic attacks yet again. She had been scooting for about a week but I didnt think much of it since she has never had an issue with expressing and has only had her anal glands expressed once as part of a comprehensive exam and they didnt even end up having to do it, because the second they got remotely close to her butt, she freaked out and did it herself, all over the poor tech. Charming, I know. All of a sudden she is crying, whining, constipated, wont even let me hold her, and her tummy is harder than usual. I try to get a look at her backside the joys of dog parenthood and can feel that her glands are definitely full and possibly impacted. I, of course, assume the worst and am imagining  vet bills for ruptured glandssomething else causing the issuewho knows what. I checked Alta Vistas hours still open til  PM! YAY and called to see how busy they were, and was told they were pretty cramped but to come in as a walkin. They were lovely yet again when we showed up and Lucy didnt even need to see the vet  she was in and out with one of the techs in a short amount of time and came back to the waiting room a new dog after having her VERY full glands expressed. She has been her happy self since. The damage was under  and they were quick and nice as ever. We love Alta Vista!"
1,"I would have no problem giving up hamburgers if more veggie burgers in the world were as good as the one at Lunas, and that beautifully dressed green salad by its side... who needs fries? okay, sometimes fries are necessary, but luckily Lunas doesnt offer anything to steer me off course on day  of I will eat healthier this year. nnSo, back to that darn good and beautifully presented veggie burger I had mine fire  brimstone style... crunchy slices of bread, creamy hummus and guac, perfectly constructed quinoa patty, just enough heat to keep me happy, and a  price tag... okay, were not on the dollar menu here, but definitely par as far as other housemade veggie burger prices in town go that ive found. But, for the price you leave feeling a very content and very nongreasy full. They were out of the ingredients for the Volcano and the Kale Lemonade, so I ended up with a Ginger Ale  and it was delicious. The white pomegranate tea with agave is also mighty tasty. nnThe service was perfect as we were sitting outside. Took our orders in a timely fashion, and checked on us just enough once we got everything. I didnt really pay attention to how long our food took, but it seemed about average. When we were given the check there was also a pair of macaroons, to make up for not having the ingredients for my first two drink picks, which was much appreciated mostly because they were AWESOME and Id completely forgotten about my much wanted Volcano since my ginger ale definitely hit the spot. nnAfter that meal I kind of want to try everything, especially some breakfast.  But Lunas, why cant you be open for dinner??"
1,Im a first time boba tea drinker so I decided to end my curiosity and finally taste it. I had the thai tea with boba and it was pretty delicious. The prices are really good for the drinks and they have so many options. Ill be back to try other stuff on the menu.
1,"When you are in the presence of greatness you pay! Monetarily and, lines if you arrive after they open at  or on weekends but it is well worth it.nnCoffee yum and refilled regularly. I have been to Matts x in the  mornings I was in Phoenix and this place is ALL American Awesomeness!!!!!!!!!nnLooking like a deserty, Route  style spot, with tables well spread apart I ate the pancakes, chop and chick and an omelette. WOW! They use lots of local stuff and it tastes amazing. Standouts are everything the Iowa chop was particulary lovely and what tastes better with a cheesey baconey, mushroomey omelette than sour dough toast with homemade jam blueberry and strawberry. This food tastes exactly like it should made with lots of love and All American Authenticity. One of the greats!"
1,"Loved this place the moment we stepped foot inside of the elevator to get to the top.  Seven of us girls were in search of a great time and we found it here at the Foundation Room!  Advertised as exclusive and VIP, I thought to myself that surely they were trying to front like other Vegas clubs.  I drank my words as we were offered free champagne and cocktails while dancing to some hot beats!nnFR offers  rooms with spacious dance floors and a patio that is perfect for their gorgeous panoramic view of the Vegas strip.  I admit that their dance floors are pretty small, but after several drinks you wont even notice the cramped space that has you dancing right up on another person .  The aforementioned patio was a perfect place to get fresh air and if you can handle folks smoking in your fresh air which was a bit of a turnoff but whatever, you get a chance to take in all of the magical spark that makes the Vegas strip what it is.nnWe ended our night here and wished that we started it off at this spot.  Great people, great atmosphere, and I would definitely party it up here again."
1,"Sangria was super refreshing. Choice of red, white, or sparkling.  a glass or  for a pitcher. Mojitos are good too. The flavored ones are . more, but  off during happy hour! Bacon wrap dates with smoked almonds and blue cheese was my favorite dish! Free bread and olives for starters! Great service too. A great place to dine besides the strip!"
1,"Easily the best pizza on the west coast and rivals the best from the east. environment is just really chill with the music playing, crowds of people, big screen tvs playing the Lakers game. they even got some old school pinball machines and an arcade game. its kind of a hard place to find if you know what to look for from all the clues that you get from anyone thats even been there but its worth it once you get there."
1,Very good food.  The staff was very friendly and cared about how we liked the food.  They gave us samples to taste and were very genuine.   stars instead of  simply for the ambiance.  Its just a self serve taqueria.
1,I was stocked when this place first opened.  Yeah at first they had a few things to sort out but for this far off the strip its very consistent.  Fridays and Saturdays are always the busiest!  n  My favorite is the ribs and brisket.  The sides are good and off course there is always room for desert.
1,"Why are people being so negative? This place is awesome! Great food, great service.  Once in  years something went wrong with a steak and the server and the manager made it right, right away!! nnI always try something new and really never do I feel disappointed. nnTry this place out. Its the best fast casual around the Steele Creek area."
1,"Well to follow up from my previous review... I was surprised when I was contacted by Joe, who I believe is the HR guy from meatheads. Anyway he went out of his way to make up for my experience and I can say I am a fan again."
1,"Once upon a time my family owned a small coffee shop and cafue in downtown Flagstaff called Sundance Bakery. So as I you can imagine I always go into places like these with a critical eye. When I walked in the door of this quaint cafue I felt immediately welcome and at home. I have always enjoyed Toucanet Coffee as I would purchase it at the Farmers Market in Flagstaff. I went back for lunch a few times and the lunch options were very nice! I would recommend the Greek Veggie Wrap and the homemade Hummus Trio. I love hummus and the light, refreshing taste of the trio plus an iced tea makes for a quick, easy, delicious place to stop for lunch. nnFrom one small business owner to another, I think Perc Up is a wonderful local place owned by two very nice women! Bon appetite!"
1,"Wake me up before you Go Go because Im not planning on going solo.nnHash House is amazazing. For all you What Would You Do? fans, the Hash House served as a backdrop for many of their scenarios. More famously, they are known for being on Man vs. Food. And unless you have an appetite like Adam Richman, I suggest you bring a friend to help you eat the madness that is Andys Sage Fried Chicken Hash House Farm Benedict. It is to die for! Chipotle cream with peppers, scrambled eggs, griddled mozzarella, fried chicken, bacon, market tomato, spinach, and biscuit on top of griddled potatoes. This is literally the best breakfast I ate in Vegas. If youre a fan of country fried chicken, this is right up your alley. MUST. EAT. NOW. Check out my photos if you need inspiration."
1,"We have been coming here for  years now and started when our first turned .  He just turned  and is able to swim across the pool by himself!  My youngest is  and just passed level  and is now able to float unassisted and can swim to the steps, the wall and pull himself out of the pool.  The staff at SwimKids is amazing and we have loved every teacher we have had here.  Everyone we have encountered is great with kids and honestly has every desire to see your child succeed.  It is a little expensive but how can you put a price on your childs life?  Living in AZ where almost everyone has a pool it is so important for your child to know at least basic survival skills God forbid something should ever happen.  Overall we love this place and have recommended many of our friends here."
1,my girlfriend spends way too much money here. probably because the service is good with mostly knowledgeable staff and they reel her in with the beauty insider points. imagine how much she has to spend for me to know what those are. i spend many hours sitting in the makeup chair waiting for her to finish looking around. so i guess im a regular too.
1,"Heading out of Vegas after a nice weekend we wanted to grab a bite to eat off of the strip. Its my job to choose our restaurants so as we drove by Bahama Breeze something made me say say stop, turn here! Im glad we did.  Its your typical chain restaurant with oversized booths and waiters in tropical shirts, but we were both pleased with our meals and our friendly waiter. We had the beef empenada appetizer, the chicken kabob over yellow rice and the fresh jerk salmon of the day. The food was seasoned well and the menu has plenty to choose from without being overwhelming. nnThe food was reasonably priced for lunch and the portions were great, not too much food it was perfect. Our waiter was so sweet and even gave us a tip on a great place to go shopping! The tropical drinks looked great, so next time I visit I would like to try one.  It was a nice relaxing comforting lunch to end our fun trip in Vegas."
1,"Southern food should make you happy, it should as my friend Arry S. puts it so plainly, its like being hugged... from the inside out. nnDish does that, you can only feel like the happy slowly filling you from the inside out.  I mean look, its a simple location, a diner, by all traits.  Its not Johnny Rockets diner, its the corner, hole in the wall diner, that you bring a girlfriend, wife, or someone you care about, for food that you wished your mom cooked every day for you.  nnIn a bowl of warmth, you find yourself knee deep in Tomato Soup, a creamy, buttery, tangy, gritty allinone smart dish. Served with a buttermilk biscuit, brushed with butter, you cant ask for more for a starter.  The Chicken and Dumplings is that little slice of goodness, its like the stuff your mother decided, to reward herself, but thought you might like it also.  The chicken was tender, and the dumplings were nicely done.  The Mac and Cheese, was the kind you find in Southern Cooking.  Its not the creamy kind you find in the fridge section, but the madebysomepersoninyourkitchensensibility and taste.  You may want some crazy cheese sauce, but this is the kind that makes you realize, they make it the way you make it at home, but just a little bit better. nnOkay, Im not from the south, but I have been to every state in the US.  There are great foods out there, and really, this places shows that you dont have to execute gastroetymology, to show case, the simple home like flavors that make this place a must visit."
1,"Im usually not a huge fan of froyo places because, for my money, Id rather have ice cream than froyo. But one day I jonesing for something frozen and sweet, and my residual guilt from overindulging had me heading toward Tops N Bottoms.nnThe place is incredibly clean and bright with plenty of seating. There is a small selection of bottoms to put in your cup before you select your yogurt so that youre not stuck with a cup of plain yogurt after you eat all the good stuff. Its a nice idea, though I do wish there was some fruit at the bottoms station too.nnThe flavor selection is pretty decent, and you can ask for samples if you cant decide. The first time I went I got the cupcake and vanilla flavors. The vanilla was nothing special, but the cupcake...holy cow. I dream of the stuff. I crave it more than I crave Haagen Dasz coffee ice cream, and that is saying something. The cupcake is a red velvet flavor that is rich and delicious and perfect in every way.nnI went back again when the desire for cupcake yogurt became too much, and this time I dragged the hubster along. I got the cupcake of course and California tart which was surprisingly good! I wasnt anticipating a plain flavor to be so delicious. It was perfect with the strawberries and blueberries I got from the topping bar. Good thing I brought the hubster  he got the white chocolate for me to try, and it was amazing. It will be perfect with the cupcake that Ill get the next time I go, because make no mistake  I will be back."
1,"Lets not talk about food for a second, lets talk about service. The Slidin Thru posse took the mean streets of Vegas and have managed to create a fun, friendly, and tasty atmosphere everywhere they have went. From knucklebumps to windowlove to gettin tipsy, the environment surrounding the Slider Truck is just rad.nnThe Slider Truck was my first experience with street food. Im now a fan street food and a fan of theirs for life. Their sliders might be some of the best burgers Ive ever tasted. The ingredients are fresh, everything is made to order, and they provide amazing customer service. When I buy a burger from these guys I can tell that they really appreciate my business. The appreciation is further shown by them when I take a bite of those delicious little sliders of awesomeness and my taste buds begin doing backflips.nnI believe in what these guys are doing and how they are doing it. They deserve all of the success they have had. They could put on a clinic on how to succeed in modern business.nnwindowlove"
1,"Ive been hooked on Benefit cosmetics line for a while. The MUA I had used it for the girls performance shows. Their eye products were and still are my favorite.  nnNow that their line has grew to include their brow bars. I like it because its super convenient since I shop at Ulta. Im not a big fan of this particular store though.  But this past visit I just happen to catch the brow technician finishing up with a client and I love the work she did. So I consulted with her and decided to get my brows waxed. Good thing they take walk ins.  Reina had one other client ahead of me, thats how popular she is.nnShe first mapped my brow to mark where the beginning, arch, and end of a brow is suppose to be and used a soft wax with strips to remove the hair and massage soothing gel to calm redness.  Real easy and quick. I like the fact  she gave me a nice shape with a decent arch which I can maintain it myself till the next appointment.  Prices are a little higher than the salon but I dont mind since they use my favorite products on my eyes and its just more convenient for me to make a one stop shop here."
1,"I come out to this place at least twice a month, usually during happy hour from  pm to  am.  The location is suspect but this is the very first sushi place in LV so there you go.nnThe late night menu is awesome.  Ultimate osaka roll, japanese lasagna and kais special are my favorites.  You can get stuffed with the happy hour appetizers too.  Try the chicken wings, the kalbi sticks and the fried rice.  Oh and the udon too.  I am not sure why some prior reviews say this place is expensive.  In my opinion, this place is very reasonable and I have not been disappointed. nnP.S. Green tea tiramisu is really good.  A little expensive at  for a slice but splurge once in a while."
1,"Great event! There was a wonderful array of goodies to sample, from a variety of fudges, nuts, chocolates, and chocolate covered  everything. There was also sampling of their gelato, wines, and bottled drinks. nnYou got the chance to go back and actually make some sweets, which was really cool too. nnThere wasnt much for vegans even the sorbet gelato flavors contain a milk product, but it was still a great event, and I was able to snag some Xmas gifts at  off. Plus, we were sent home with a goody bag of treats, which Ill be gifting. Bonus!"
1,Ok we are returning here slowly each time. We stopped coming here for awhile because the food was not up to par. I can say that this has changed! YES! I dont know if they have a new cook or management has stepped up but the food has never been better. Welcome back neighbor!
1,If youre tired of the BudMillerCoorsAmber Bock choices around here then you have a GREAT alternative!  Theyll have food soon and itll be even better!!   This place used to be Desert Liquors here in AJ and they took over and renovated what Ive alwayes called the please burn it down Cactus Club.  Now it is a terrific place to hang out and has a superlative selection of beers and can take home whatever you like too.  Everything they have on tap is top knotch!  nI used to have to drive to Mesa to find this selection and could rarely find it on tap.   I highly recommended it!nThey have regular beer tasting and other events that they publish on their facebook pagenhttpwww.facebook.compagesTheHandlebarPubandGrill
1,"I found this to be a nice, well planned airport. Security can cause a bottle neck so show up  hours before you are slated to take off. They have nice shops, a nice selection of food and it is a fairly new and up to date airport. It offers a great view of the mountains too."
1,"This just opened last summer and boy was I glad to see itfast, inexpensive, good food, VERY friendly ownersclerks, even gave me a comp spanakopita to try to get me hooked!  I would eat here all the time if I lived in town."
1,"My new favorite place in concord. Not only do you get an amazing view, but the food is awesome and the beer is litterally ice cold. We all had burgers and they were perfectly executed. Service was awesome, staff was super attentive and friendly."
1,"Food is always really tasty if youre in the mood for heart clogging chicken strips and greasy fries. Staff is always friendly and the fact that they give military discounts is great.nnThe only con I personally have with this location is its layout. Its crampedtiny. As soon as you walk in everyone sitting down eating their food starts to stare at you obsessively like theyve never seen another human being before. You have to side step to the soda fountain machine or else youll bump into other people sitting.nnOther than that, its one of my favorite places to grab a quick, unhealthy bite."
1,"There was a point during the taxi ride from Waverley Station out to this hotel that I regretted picking one seemingly so far away. When we turned off the road and drove through the beautiful grounds, past sheep and Shetland ponies, and up to the old stone building  formerly a castle I changed my mind. The location is actually quite lovely very quiet and with lots of space.nnI spent three nights there, getting the bus in and out of town each day, which took about  minutes. The room was clean and attractive with a nice deep bath. nnBreakfast was included and was excellent. There was a huge spread of breads, cheeses, pastries,fruit and hot items such as eggs, sausage, black pudding and even haggis. The lady in charge of the waffles was very friendly and cheerful.nnI used the gym twice and was very happy with the choice and standard of equipment."
1,"Yum!nnWe were first introduced to Bueno Burger at The Taste of Glendale. There they served a pulled pork sandwich that stuck in my memory and today I just had to taste it again.nnWhen we arrived I got a little worried because I did not see a pulled pork sandwich on the menu board but to my relief I saw it on a paper menu with seasonal item written below it. I asked and sure enough they were able to satisfy my craving. Pulled pork in a mild bbq sauce with cilantro slaw on top. typically I am not a major slaw fan, but the seasoning in this one is a perfect addition to the sandwich. It was as good as I remembered and I can only hope that next  time we go back it will be in season. The husband had a burger Glendale Style which had bacon, mushrooms, horseradish sauce, and swiss cheese. For under  bucks we were both stuffed and satisfied walking out the door and felt it was overall a pleasant experience. We will be back"
1,"One of the BEST spa experiences I have had! Qua Baths and Spa offered up extraordinary service from the moment I walked into the door. I had a massage here on my last day in Vegas and have to say that too was fantastic! The therapist knew exactly what I wanted and seemed to work out all of my tension that I had built up from all of the Vegas excitement.nnThe different Roman Baths were also a nice touch and added to the experience. It was nice to warm up before the massage and being able to cleanse in this super cold room that has snowflakes falling down. The eucalyptus wet towels also feel great when you are in the medium or super hot pool. Oh! And they even have a tea sommelier when you want to have a fancy pants tea paired to your treatments!nnThe gym was also a nice touch to have when staying at Caesars  it was kinda pricey to use the gym for the couple days I was there though  a day or  for a threeday pass, which is what I used. The equipment was very clean and the gym offered complementary bottled water and fresh fruit."
1,"My boyfriend and I came to Tamari after randomly searching online for a sushi place that we hadnt been to.  Tamari had just opened and wasnt overly packed... not long after we came back and discovered a wait because we did not have a reservation!  luckily we were able to eat at the bar... I have not had a bad thing on the menu.  The staff has always been friendly  the food has been fantastic!  awesome sushi, awesome tapas, awesome cocktails... Despite the new need for reservations, I am really excited that Tamari has been so well recognized in the Pittsburgh area."
1,Service was excellent. Server took her time to explain everything to us. nnPizza was perfect. Tomato sauce was done right. Crust was light and crispy. nnMeatball was great. Big and perfect with the sauce. nnThe mud pie was amazing. The coffee ice cream helped balance the chocolate crust. nnDefinitely coming back to try the other pizzas and desserts.
1,"One of the great things about living in the southwest, is how all the food traditions have followed us here. nnWant a Philly Cheesesteak? Forgetaboutit!  New Yawk deli? Weve got dat too!  A Chicago dog? Abssofreakinlootely! LOL  How about that Aaron Rogers and George Wendt commercial?  Grill Class, I love it!  nnIt seems Chicago style, Vienna Beef places are all over greater Phoenix. What you dont see too often, are these family owned places. In Chicago you have Mom and Pop places all over. Each one trying to create their own piece of heaven for their loyal customers. nnWell I believe Dazzos is one of those places too. You come in, you are greeted by one of the Dazzo family members. Warmly! None of that phony baloney stuff. Just, thanks for coming in!  First time here?  Where are you from?  They also have family pictures all over the wall, going back to when they first opened. Nice! nnAnd if UR interested, they also have a nice collection Chicago team Sun Times clippings, mostly of the Bulls and Cubs stuff. nnOkay, this is all great Georgie, but what makes it so special?  Well, the food!  Grilled Jumbo Dogs, Red Hots, Fire Dogs, Brats, Italian Beef  they have them all and theyre cooked fresh, just for you. Delicious!nnAnother plus are their French fries. Theyre exquisite and topped with a nice mixture of seasoning salt. Im not a big fries guy, but I might come back for some more of them. nnBut when I do come back, Ill bring more Cash because they dont accept Plastic. nnEnjoy!"
1,"Whenever I travel, I obsess about bringing back the perfect regional souvenirs and foodie items for family and friends.  Were living in the Phoenix area for a few months and I wanted to send small and inexpensive Arizonaesque little gifts to my sons preschool class in VA.  The sample sized candies are perfect and they sell them in bulk bags of  in the store. The store itself is a hole in the wall, but the gentleman working there couldnt have been nicer.  He gave my kids free lollipops and a student discount on the large order of candy.  And the candy itself is just insanely good."
1,"Classy and buffet usually dont go together, but the Wynn nails it their buffet is the best dinner buffet on the Strip Ive had thus far. It ought to be, for the price .nnStations represent different ethnic foods, your typical Indian, typical Chinese, some Thai. The salad bar was fresh and inventive. The lamb was amazingly moist, the highlight of the meat offerings. The charcuterie was an unexpected treat, little pickles and all, and the dessert area impressed me, even without a sweet tooth. Of course, king crab legs never disappoint.nnFriends and I decided to celebrate a birthday here, so after we let our server know, we were provided a dessert assortment, complete with candle, while waiters sang Happy Birthday. Thoughtful!nnThe buffet has a ton of seating, and you dont feel like youre on a farm thanks to strategicallyplaced partitions which provide a sense of privacy. The ambiance is money  one should expect nothing less from the Wynn."
1,"This place is exactly what it advertises, nothing fancy, no frills. Just yummy Mac and cheese however you want it.  The hubby and I ate here the other day and after we ordered our Mac and cheese we took our first bites and looked at each other like Yum! He had the Italian sausage, which was spicy and full of flavor while I opted for the cheddar with vegetables. The service wasnt bad at all and we ended up tipping the young girl five dollars because she was nice and the food was just as we ordered it. We also had a groupon and we were given no problems."
1,I am a regular here and ive never had a bad experience.  The sushi is consistantly delicious and fresh.  This is not an all you can eat sushi with crazy rolls. The pricing is very reasonable for quality sushi and they have a great lunch deal if u get there before .
1,"My review is limited to their bar area.  They have excellent bar bites menu from  daily.  I am guessing daily includes weekends.  and the portion is sizable.  They have several options, including the prime rib burger, the mushroom ravioli, Cajun shrimps, calamari, beef carpaccio, and the new addition pork belly with chuney and goat cheese grits. nnI have been here several times, food is good especially for the price. The most recent visit last Thursday I tried the pork belly and carpaccio. I was a little disappointed in the pork belly, it was rather bland. But the grits and chuney were yummy. The carpaccio was ok, they could have gone lighter on the sauce and I wasnt getting the little mount of greens in the middle.  I think the calamari, ravioli and the shrimps were the best bets. nnService was good.  We were not big spenders, but water and soda were filled regularly. Bartender checked on us every so often. We were in and out in  minutes. I am a fan of Flemings for quick bites at a great price with solid food and service."
1,"SHAZAM!!!  nnAlso   Best. Cupcakes. Ever.    nnIn celebration of my husbands st birthday last weekend, I asked my motherinlaw, who currently hails from Vegas, to transport  cupcakes from Las Vegas to Joshua Tree, across the Mojave Preserve.  She was road tripping with her girlfriend Pat a la  Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, except that instead of the ether and the bats, there were cupcakes.  Lots and lots of cupcakes.  nnWhen pressed to answer the question what kind of cake do you want for your birthday this year, my husband suggested this bakery, which he called the best bakery in Las Vegas.  How he knew about it, I still have no idea, considering his lack of a sweet tooth, but Im eternally grateful to him for making the recommendation.  After perusing their website and poring over the photographs on their flickr page, I was hooked.    I called the bakery and ordered one dozen each of the following flavorsnnChocolate loves vanilla Chocolate cake topped with vanilla buttercreamnnApple cider Cinnamon swirl cake topped with apple cider buttercream and dusted with cinnamon and sugarnnHop Scotch Vanilla cake topped with vanilla buttercream dipped in butterscotch ganache, their  selling cupcakennPucker Up Raspberry cake topped with lemon buttercream Winner of the Las Vegas Weekly  Vegas Best Offbeat Dessert nnI also picked a desertthemed cupcake design that I found on the bakerys flickr pagennhttpwww.flickr.comphotosretrobakerynnAdding the design to each cupcake upped the price considerably, but it was worth every penny.  They warnt cheap, but they shore were purdy.  I was happy to discover that the emblems themselves were also delicious and didnt detract from the individual cupcake flavors in any way.nnOverall, I loved every one of the flavors we picked.  The chocolate loves vanilla was the most surprising of the quartet because they managed to make something VA VA VOOM out of something triedandtrue, and artfully so.  During the party, I tried an Apple cider cupcake, which I thought was a little too sweet to finish. The next morning, however, I had absolutely no trouble eating any of the other cucpakes, one right after the other, so the Apple Cider Incident could have just been a fluke moment of nonhunger.  Overall, my favorite flavor was the Pucker Up  holy man of moses, the tart and tangy flavor of the lemon buttercream was so perfect to cut the sweetness of the buttercream and the exactly right flavor to complement the raspberry muffin part.  nnNow, my little group of friends may choose to live in bumfuck, California, but they hail from all over the globe and have done their share of time in major cities.  What Im trying to say is that we have eaten some freaking cupcakes in our lifetimes.  These were NOT our first cupcakes, if you know what I mean.  Been there, cupcake.  nnI think you get my point.nnAt an opportune moment last Saturday, I was finally able to grab my husbands elbow and make him stand still long enough to blow on some candles and pick a flavor.  Most everyone followed suit.  What happened next was remarkable.  The fine lines around peoples eyes began to fall away.  Several people began to giggle.  A few people stared furiously at their paper plate, chewing vigorously, trying simultaneously to savor the moment and also make room for the next one.  In ten minutes or less, ten people were skulking around the table, eyeing the choices, selecting their next victim.  Others were surreptitiously looking for tupperware, tinfoil, a cloth grocery bag, anything remotely cupcake sized into which they might fit one for the road.  The mmmmmmmm sound was punctuated by people saying things like OH my GOD andor where did these COME FROM?  TELL ME!   Several people snagged business cards, others started brainstorming and scheming about who they might know in Las Vegas and what they would be willing to do in exchange for some cupcakes.    In fact, since the Great Cupcake Unveiling, tourism to Las Vegas from Joshua Tree has increased by .  Im already planning on asking my mother in law, who is coming back out here in a few weeks, to bring us another two dozen.  nnWhen you live in a town full of shitty grocerystorebrand cakes and no momandpop bakeries, finding just the right cupcake for a yearold mans birthday party can be challenging.    Lucky for us, theres Retro Bakery, purveyor of fine party cupcakes and cakes for any occasion."
1,"Every spring we spend two weeks in Phoenix for spring training.  Each year we go to Haps several times for a quick lunch.  We stick with the sandwiches  pulled pork, brisket, chicken, or ham.  They are all very good.  The sauce is excellent but they never give us enough so we order more.  My family loves the slaw uhgg.  The other sides are OKayish but not on par with the BBQ. The best part is the hot peach cobbler for dessert.  The prices are adequate.  The location is near a lot of things or at least enroute.  The staff is efficient and friendly. nnAs for the BBQ  The meat is smoked and cooked with a rub not in the sauce.  Some people like this but I prefer my BBQ to be cooked in or basted with the sauce.  The BBQ sauce is served more as a condimenttopping or dip.  The sauce is bold like a Texas BBQ with some hints of sweetness of KC style.nnIn short, we will go to Haps again and again.  We will and have recommended this eatery to family and close friends."
1,The only buffet I will eat at in Las Vegas!nnIm not a fan of buffets but I thought this one was good!  I liked that the different ethnic food station had their own chefs constantly plated hot food.
1,This place is outstanding. Im visiting Vegas for a few days and decided to get away from the strip and try something new. The place is a nice sports restaurant with excellent Asian food. The fried rice was awesome along with the noodle soup.  I will be back the next time Im in Vegas.
1,"I found Slice of Vegas by accident when I was on groupon looking for some discounts on food. read reviews about it, and lots of people have been bragging about how good the service and the pizza is at this place. Slice of Vegas is located in Mandalay bay, just right next to Burgr bar. The place is big for a pizzeria but there is always a lot of people waiting to be seated.  nnThe menu contains a typical selection of pizza, and my favorite pizza is the miles  meat pizza. like the name implies, the pizza has  different kind of meat on it. good thing about slice of vegas is that, the pizza was never frozen, u can really taste the freshness of it. The pizza slices were thin. it has that crispiness that I really like, with a perfect amount of chewiness. and the flavor is really good. nnI have only tried  of their pizza at this place, the miles  meat and the  cheese truffle. The sauce on the pizza was good. its the perfect amount. on the miles  meat, the sauce was dark red, and a bit sweet. u cant really taste the tomato flavor of it, which is a good thing for me, since I hate tomatoes. The amount of cheese on it was in good balance. All the ingredients on the miles  meat were tasty. The  cheese truffle is good, but tends to be very oily. nnOverall, the pizza were really good and I would really recommend it. its not really a wow factor but we are in vegas and not nyc. I think the pizza really taste good. it has the perfect balance of sauce, toppings and cheese. it has that perfect crispiness with every bite. ull even lick ur fingers, coz its that finger lickn good. lol."
1,"Ginban has become our goto family sushi spot in Atown...its excellent...only thing holding this pace back is inconsistent service. nnThe place is modern and stylish, especially considering the strip mall location.  The sushi bar is attractive and functional. There are TVs strategically placed around the restaurant, which is perfect if you want to catch snippets of the Blackhawks playoff match out of the corner of your eye while pretending to give your family your full attention. nnThe food is outstanding. The salmon sashimi is fresh and delicious and the yellowtail is among the best Ive tasted.  Im not a big roll fan, but the family really likes theirs especially the Tiger Roll and the Eel Avocado roll.  The Unagi is really good as well. Ive also tried the chicken teriyaki, which was good and tastefully presented but not lifechanging. nnThe beer selection is just fine. The usual Japanese staples plus one or two nice surprises Dog Fish Head  Minute IPA, I think!. Could be served colder, but whatever. nnI get that handcrafted sushi can take a while, but they need to get it together.  Orders come out at odd times, like last night all three courses of my dinner were served long before the rest of the family received even their first morsel  of delicious raw fish.  There is also the occasional mistake, like the time we received ahi sashimi instead of salmon, but these things happen. One thing that would really help would be if the servers could kick up their attentiveness. They always avoid you like youve got SARS during these awkward long waits.  Invariably we want another beer or to add to our sushi order, but there is no one to be found...or even anyone willing to make eyecontact!  Of course, during a grownup dinner with epic quantities of sake bombers they should take their sweetdamntime bringing the fish. nnUltimately, we still love this place despite its flaws. The sushi is worth the wait and we have resolved to plan ahead more, but a little better service would mean a lot regardless."
1,"On a recommendation was here for lunch Friday afternoon and WOW. Ive never had such a freshly made sandwich before from a shop. I had the vegetarian , which was full of different veggies sprouts, cucumber, lettuce, tomato, etc, on a whole grain bread that definitely tasted homemade. It was filling and excellent and in no way am I a vegetarian! Im also NOT a fan of mayo, but I even enjoyed the mayo on this sandwich. I will definitely be coming back to try their other creations, especially now that we have the convenience of the light rail to get us to Tempe!"
1,"This was my sisters first stay in Vegas and my nd as adults.  She was recommended the Rio by a coworker who lives there so she found a deal online and we booked it.nnAll in all it was a really nice hotel.  Even though it is off the strip, there is a shuttle as many mention that takes you back and forth to ParisBallys and Harrahs.  As everyone has noted, the rooms are HUGE.  The sofa was plenty comfy.  They had a lot of coupons in their booklet that helped bring the cost down for us on things like super fancy meal at the Seafood restaurant and for the show.  nnI wanted to like the pool area, but unfortunately when we went to go swimming at  on a Sunday, they had closed the whole area to get ready for a concert in the evening. What?!  That was very disappointing as I had been dreaming all day about going swimming in the pool.  When they did reopen the area at ish to let the concert goers in the concert was free, so we got to go in and swim, but then it was just weird because it was mostly full of people there for the concert, so we didnt stay long.nn The dealers we experienced were for the most part really nice and helpful.  There was only one I had a negative experience with and luckily her boss was right there when she made the mistake so I didnt have to argue with her.  We had a very helpful roulette dealer in the early afternoon who showed my sister the ins and outs of betting which she appreciated since she had never done it before.  nnI found the beds to be offputtingly firm, so I didnt like that.  They also had at least in our room a weird window in the shower that looked into the room so when you were in there showering I felt a little exposed It was only my shoulders up but Im at   Any taller and you maybe exposing more.  That meant, too, that if you turned on the light in the bathroom in the middle of the night, there was a flash of light in the room too.  nnAll in all, though, it was a fun weekend getaway.  We probably could have not left the hotel at all and had a pretty good time just there."
1,I love this place. I used to not be a big fan of polish food but then my Dad dragged me here and Ive been hooked ever since. The Hunters Stew and the Kielbasa platter are to die for and the service is excellent. I have never been disappointed with this place and plan on making a trip there this weekend. They also do these cooking classes which are a bit expensive but I sort of want to try one.
1,"They have solid pizza. It is NY Style, which I prefer, and the selection of toppings is good. I had sausage and cheese and it was good. Not too greasy and the crust is excellent. I would recommend as it is a good pizza and prices are really low. A great spot for all this students across the street who I suspect dont realize its there. nnI will head back in there and order some whole pizzas to try out the full spectrum of toppings I am able to jam onto a pie. Until next time."
1,the rincon burger and the hawaiian burger are delicious. The fries are good also. Im excited about this place making it back to our rotation. A few years ago we had to drop it since it cooked all their fries with peanut oil. food allergies Just found out they now use vegetable oil now. Great burgers and fries. Mmm suddenly im thinking of a juicy succulent burger.
1,"My roommates and I love Daisy! This restaurant is on a trendy, nice street and has a great ambiance. Their food is excellent Egg Salad Sandwich is amazing and, lets not forget, their cupcakes! Delish! Its a sweet little place and offers wifi, the staff is kind, and they do serve beer and wine."
1,"SO YUMMY!  Very simple, down to earth and deliciously local!  nnThe hostess is a doll, she is very sweet and  humble.  She took the time to talk to our party of .nnOur waiter was very attentive, without hovering.  He was helpful with the menu items and was able to help us through our first time there.nnThe interior is beautiful, a very quaint eatery.   We had a table in the back in front of a wall of windows that looks out on the back yard.nnWe will all be back to try more tasty choices off the menu!"
1,"i knew wed have a good time at the Orange Table after reading all the positive reviews on yelp.nnwe visited on the first morning of our weekend trip to scottsdale.  we ordered...nna mamosa  typical but always a great brunch drink.na glass or oj  extremely freshnn plate of pancakes  cant go wrong with freshly made pancakes! nthe monaco  very smelly provolone so it was delicious.nthe white flannel  breakfast winner!!!  ive had many salty corned beef hash but theirs was seasoned perfectly!  nthe hatch  we were pleasantly surprised to find the chicken very moist.  nthe bohemian deluxe?  with a little sprinkle of tabasco, this dish was superb.nnthe servers were kind and we loved the laid back decor.  we thoroughly enjoyed our breakfast and it definitely started the weekend on a positive note."
1,"I may not be the first to review the Vdara but I can still say that I was the first person ever to stay in my room and sleep in the bed! I may never do that again at such a luxurious billion  Hotel and Spa. nA large group of friends and I hit Vegas for a birthday celebration and to do a little running in the Rock n Roll Marathon. I just so happened to be the only single person on the trip and missed out on the Southwest Airlines package deal for the Bellagio. So my good friends super Internet savvy neighbor scoured the net and found the Vdara was opening the week of the race. One quick call to the reservation specialist and I had a fantastic suite for less than the Bellagio. nFirst sight of the building from the strip and it gleams in the sun with its curved walls of glass. Bell hop right out to the limo to grab my bags and off to my room with a quick stop to the front desk. Lobby is nice and quiet with two bars and an area to just chill. Something to be said for a piece of mind away from the hustle and noise of the casinos. nMy room was a modern design of glass, dark woods and an Asian flair with sliding doors. Kitchen, dining area, living room, bed room and a monster bathroom with a massive tub. Giant LCD TV and windows shades for day or night lighting. But why close the shades it will only hide the sweet view of the strip and the Aria and new mall. nI have been to Vegas several times and stayed at a variety of Casionohotel combos at all price levels. I can say by far this is the best place in Vegas I have ever stayed. Even though the idea is not to spend any time in your room, Vdara makes you want to stay in."
1,"So we went for my girlfriends birthday.  I have to say I was definitely a fan of the open layout.  The kitchen was in full view and the space was definitely utilizing the great weather of Phoenix.  Dont fret if you get a spot outside as there are numerous misters ready to cool you down.  If you do sit by the misters, expect a cool, almost tropical breeze during your meal.  Honestly, the food was pretty good.  We had the chicken tacos which were small but tasty, had the suzuki roll which was the star of the dinner, and a spicy yellow tail roll that was eehhh ok.  The fish isnt amazing but the creative rolls and the atmosphere was fantastic.  Our service was spotty.  They made efforts but they were clearly too busy.  Likely, this issue will clear up as they outgrow their growing pains.  For dessert, we had the chocolate lava cake which was yummy.  The horchata ice cream was a bit icy for our taste but was made up by the juicy cake.  Would try again as the menu was so expansive we couldnt try everything we wanted.  Good business strategy, offering numerous amounts of dishes that you have to try"
1,"I ate here while on business in Pittsburgh. I had wandered for hours all over Pittsburgh with the intention of casually stumbling upon a place for lunch. I had a little more trouble then I anticipated. It came to the point where I was desperate and about to jump off of one of the many bridges leaving downtown that I had crossed that day. Finally, to save me from the icy freezing february waters of the Allegheny River I stumbled across Six Penn. nnThe first thing I noticed its warm. At that point it was all I really cared about. I was seated immediately at a table for two and I sat facing the street so I could look out. My waiter was very friendly and came over immediately with water. I asked what he would suggest on the menu, but unfortunately suggested almost all meat plates Im not a big meat eater. Thats when I saw under appetizers just what I wanted that day A grilled cheese sandwich with tomato soup .  I also ordered a side of their homemade potato chips that I had seen someone else with . nnFood Deeeelish! The tomato soup was wonderful! Thick and creamy and hot and delicious. The grilled cheese sandwich cheesy and buttery and an artery clogger, but just what I needed at the time. And the homemade potato chips were to die for. I also ordered desert, I got the brownie sundae .. The desert was decent, but I was expecting a little more for the price, still very good though.nnI recommend Six Penn Kitchen and if I ever go back I will try it for dinner as my waiter mentioned there was a separate dinner menu."
1,"I love this place! Its a huge super market complete with a deli, bakery, eatery, and everything else.  No really, everything else.  Its a great hidden gem for east coast goodies as well!nnI  approve of their pizza.  You can change things up and get a huge  pie for just  bucks! Its not good stuff, its great stuff. Seriously."
1,"This is as good as it gets, and is setting the bar higher for the rest of the Strip. Everything is fresh, always, and the recipes are considered and nuanced, but still very approachable versions of street food from around the world. nnIm a bigger guy, and I can put away the groceries. So you know when I am eating slowly, its really good. The Thin Man is just plain delicious."
1,All around great burger place with a martini twist.  Ive been here many times and have to say its a great place to drink and meet new people.  I highly recommend the common table in the middle of the place.  Service was great and the atmosphere is cool and hip. SWEET POTATO FRIES....enough said.
1,"I took my son for a stay cation for his upcoming th birthday. We stayed in the Luna di Lusso East building, in a  bedroom suite. The room was beautiful and the view from our patio was gorgeous! We spent a lot of time at our pool which was wonderful, the water was perfect. We walked over the bridge to the shops and restaurants and watched the sunset. We were told we were welcome to use the pool at Viera but after checking it out decided we liked ours better at Luna di Lusso. It was tough to check out and leave! We will hopefully be back soon!!"
1,"Dear holy awesome gluten free menu!!! nnIm  excited for a restaurant thats been approved by a celiac association  and they display it right on their door! Everything here is awesome  I had the gluten free crush pizza and got the vegetarian option. I also had the watermelon mojito  with real chunks of watermelon and mint! They have GREAT gluten free appetizers as well! nnThis is my new favorite restaurant, and although pretty pricey, its a great date restaurant, or a good girlfriend date. Especially for celiacs, vegetarians, or organic junkies. nnA must visit!"
1,"Those damn fountains that go off every  minutes are IT.  I love free entertainment, I love All that jazz..., it was so great!nnKieran and I ran from the Hilton all the way to the Bellagio using the monorail of course, to catch the last night showing at pm.  We got the best seats and made it just in time luckily I didnt stall in front of the Fendi store!nnHe really wanted me to see it for obvious reasons and he was right, I loved it!  Pretty darn spectacular."
1,"If done correctly, you might have the time of your life at Daylight Beach Club... if not, youll just spend WAAAAY too much money and leave with pink eye. Bear with me friends, let me begin.nnUnless you have all the money in the world to blow which i dont  youre going to want to get yourself on a guestlist. Its not too difficult to find a guest list to get on, just use that brain of yours to search the web or find a promoter in or around Mandalay Bay to get you on one. If you have trouble finding a guest list, private message me and ill see if i can help. The guest list i was on gave me free cover a huge saving as long as i brought a female in with me, whom also got in free... just get there before  PMnnGals with a guest list bracelet supposedly drink for free until  PM but i dont think it was good booze they were giving away, and nothing your liver would want to filter....nnDrinks were about  a piece, and buying one of those plastic, refillable cups is a requirement in order to have fun and swim while drinking. Just buy the silly cup so you can fit in with everybody else.nnWhile waiting in line to get drinks, use again that brain of yours to observe the bartenders. Along with all them being a little on the rude side, they do poor stiff drinks. Watch which bartender pours the stiffest drinks and just go to her. When youre there youll know exactly what i am talking about.nnSince were on the topic of drinks do you yourself a favor and only order vodkawaters for  reasons.  Theyre cheaper. You get charged separately for the liquor and the mixer and in this specific case water is free.  Youre going to need to drink a lot of water anyways in order to stay alive seriously people were passing out from lack of water and being in the blazing sun all day. So drink a retarded amount of water before the day even starts and keep guzzling the stuff while youre there.  They dont seem to sell bottom shelf vodka so even for the shamefully high price of the drinks, youre getting quality vodka that in theory will give you far less of a hangover.nnLet talk about security. According to past Yelp reviews, i expected the security team to be Nazis figuratively speaking, NOT literally. In actuality they werent that bad. They were more professional than i originally imagined. The lifeguards were dicks... but i mean really, who cares, theyre lifeguards! Of course they hate people, especially drunk ones, and im sure if i passed out in the pool they wouldve been there to save my life. Whatever, dont let me start rambling.nnThe DJ was good, the views were nice, the women were beautiful, the line passes were worthless, i was confident  the pool water was realistically probably one tenth urine and spilled drinks, but whatever, its a pool party after all. Theres so much chlorine in there the worst thing you could possibly get is pink eye, which you will get if you go under water. So dont go under water and dance yourself stupid with beautiful people to fun music and expensive drinks.nnIt was truly a five star experience, but i had to pull one star away though because there was SOOO many bottle caps on the ground, and since everyone is barefoot for at least a little while... i stepped on one and it cut the bottom of my foot open deep. I wouldve got stitches but i dont have healthcare readily available. Insert Obama joke here  Is it worth a lawsuit??? No, it really isnt but seriously, the bottle caps were everywhere and they were sharp and that wasnt cool at all. Id like a written apology for allowing such a foreseeable problem but at the same time its my own damn fault for drinking too much of there expensive liquor and stepping on a sharpass bottle cap. Im rambling again.nnFriends, aside from the bottle cap issue, this place was everything i was hoping for. The product i received from Daylight was fantastic and well worth the  i spent on drinks, its Vegas after all... theyll get the money out of you. With that being said, good luck, Praise be to God, and Semper Fi."
1,So this was fun!!nnGood food!!!  Fun  entertaining!! Didnt expect all the dancing  the action fighting!! Just expected the horseback riding and jousting stuff.  The wizard and pyrotechnics where fun too!!nnLots of BANG for the buck!!nn year old son enjoyed it.
1,"If you take this place for what it is its  or  star.  On a strict restaurant review I would go . or .  STK is located in the new Cosmopolitan hotel on the Vegas strip.  They specialize in steaks and some fantastic specialty cocktails, oh I forgot to mention that other kind of tail.  This place is a meat market through and through, from your plate to the numerous plastic women and GQ guys walking around.  This is a great place to go, enjoy a real nice steak I had the cowboy, and see and be seen.  They also had a couple fantastic apps, the beef carpaccio and tuna tar tare really stood out.  I would definitely go back and in fact we did almost every night to get one of there fantastic hand crafted cocktails."
1,"I like coming here. The food is great and authentic. Drinks are awesome. Service can be hit or miss at times, but if youre not in a rush its ok. However, the last few times here the service has been great. So hopefully they are improving in that area."
1,"They have the best Falafel I ever had... by far.   I have been eating Falafel my whole life in NYC an LI and would of been happy just to find a place that even offered it in Charlotte... but this place totally blew away my mediocre expectations.  I havent had anything else here because I can not pass up on the amazing Falafel.  Oh, and its !!!"
1,We had dinner here on  ..Steak Lovers Heaven !!! If you love steaks this is the restaurant to come while in Vegas. It is pricey but worth every penny..  Nice cocktail menu.. creative mixologists at work...I had the asian pear martini and my hubby the traditional ketel one martini a little dirty..  for appetizer the pork belly is a must try.. it is cruchy on the outside and buttery tender in the inside..perfection.. the butter lettuce salad its amazing.. if you can believe that a salad can be amazing you should try this one.  With an array of choices from the meat menu could be quite intimidating but the servers are highly trained to help you make the best selection.  I chose the bone in petit filet mignon and my hubby tried the kobe filet both charred to perfection on the outside and buttery in the inside.. melts in your mouth.. WOW !!! worth every penny.. for sides we had the brussel sprouts and the spinach both excellent and for dessert the fig cake with gianduja ice cream YUM !  Please do not let the name Wolfgang puck confuse you .. this one is one of his best restaurants.. way different to Spago..
1,"Stopped in for lunch. Nothing fancy about the dining room, but it was clean and the service was prompt and friendly.  Daughter had chicken fried rice and I had the kung pao chicken and shrimp. Very tasty, nice big shrimp, for a lunch portion, and not to much oil used in the prep. Very good flavor. No upcharge for white meat in either of our meals. The only thing Id say was a wee bit of a disappointment, the fried rice didnt have the usual peas and carrots. Some maybe would like that, we would have preferred them to be included.nnOverall a good meal and a reasonable price."
1,"Breakfast and Bansky art  If youre tired of the Vegas strip, crappy overrated old fashioned restaurants, and youre in search of a cool place to eat, then this place is definitely for you.nnIt was my last day in Vegas and I wanted some nice breakfast that wasnt going to be greasy and large just for the sake of it. Americans love their large portions. Anyway my yelp search brought me here. Actually I was heading to eat but all the roads were closed off and I didnt want to walk alone with my  month old amongst all the foul smelling homeless people so I had to yelp search again but Im glad I did!nnI shared the MTO breakfast with my son. OMG it was one of the best breakfasts Ive had, full of protein and lots of YUM without feeling greasy and grossed out afterwards!! Three eggs, chicken sausage, FOUR pieces of bacon I think two was Turkey had two normal, spam I wasnt too keen on but hey Im not American, tomatoes, cheesy hash, some berries and two thick pieces of toast. I wasnt keen on the bread only because Im from Europe and Im not a fan of American bread. I wish I took a photo of it but as soon as it came my son was all over it so I missed my chance  you really have to see it to appreciate how yummy the breakfast is. I love my chicken sausages and turkey bacon so it really was a perfect breakfast for me. Coffee was good too. nnIf you checkin on yelp, you get a free pastry. We got a free muffin and a small pastry as a substitute because we had to leave and the walnut toastie was still baking. nnI saw some cool looking pancakes with grated carrot ? on top and also bacon pancakes!! Which my husband wouldve really liked if he wouldve come with us. Im sad we have to leave today, because I wouldve come back again tomorrow if we were still in Vegas."
1,"They make the actual Vesper drink form the novel!!  Its a show to watch the drink be made, they even burn an orange peel before dropping it into your martini glass.  The service was friendly and professional.  The atmosphere is Bond inspired but does not refer to the series and therefore avoids any tacky direct references.  Weve added Vesper bar to our mustvisitagain list for Vegas."
1,"Ill have to admit, I was a little skeptical about trying a business with only  review but I was glad that I did. Tim really is amazing at what he does. I went out on a whim and called him on a Sunday afternoon where nobody else was even open because of my back window that got broken out. Tim was able to get out to me all the way in Henderson in what seemed like no time. He even showed up with boards to board up my busted out window to prevent anyone from getting in. He carefully cleaned up the broken glass and took his measurements, explained to me the whole process and turnaround time to get the replacement glass. I paid only an extra few  for rush service because I hated the fact my window was broken. I kid you not, I talked to Tim at  pm on Sunday and he called me within  hours telling me my new glass was ready to be installed!! Unbelievable. He showed up on time as promised to install the new glass and was even nice enough to take more time out of his day to fix my shower door that was also on the fritz! The world would be a better place if there were more people like Tim. His prices are reasonable, hes great to deal with and does great work. Keep it up man, Ill be calling you again!"
1,"My mother cant live without the soupstyle beans, and shes right. I get the Clare burro, which has queso fresco, whole pinto beans, and avocado. I also usually get some guacamole, which is very chunky here, and add a bit of salt to eat with the chips. nnIts a family place for me, I dont ever really like it as much when I try to take other people, and this is the second move I can remember. My folks are sticking by this one, and I am happy to tag along!"
1,"Our group of  got in line at about midnight or so. The line was very long but we didnt have too much trouble on the wait and getting in. We waited no longer than mins and the cover for the guys were  our group of girls got in free.nnThe place is nice and spacious, a lot of tables and booths, and several bars. There were a lot of people inside the nightclub dancing and drinking. Some areas of poles where there are girls dancing as well. If you walk outside, there is a huge area that has the pools and a gambling area.nnThere was one particular bouncer who was being a complete a. He kept pushing us into the middle of the dance floor because we were in the aisle we werent even blocking the walkway because we were sitting on the little wall.nnMusic overall was good, not that great."
1,"In the category of poutine this place was hands down the best we had while in town.  The staff was awesome, the food was great.  it was a little pricey for a pile of potatoes, but worth it for sure.  I dig the choose your own adventure approach, tho prescribed combos are also available.  Decidedly higher quality ingredients than most poutine competitors as well."
1,"These cupcakes are so flavorful and sweet.  I bought a few at Halloween and freinds were coming over and one freind is not a sweet eater at all.  She ate the kahula cupcake and loved it, that was a true test of these cupcakes.  The sweet potatoe and pumpkin cupcakes were out of this world, if you love a sweet potatoe pie or pumkin pie this cupcake is for you. Now I will say there is enough icing on these for a good sugar rush. Now here is a trick someone told me to do was cut the cake part inhalf, than take half the icing and do cake, icing, cake , icing lol  It was very good, Ive taken these to the nieghbors kid and he is on my front porch before I put the phone down to tell his mother I have a SAS cupcake for him.  I think Its a great place to go for a little girls birthday party, Im  I wanna cupcake party in there with the pink princess hat on lol   Try the Triple Chocolate  with the granche youll never buy another grocery store cupcake in your life"
1,"Been here a few times when were in town and you cant beat the ambiance. The bread is to die for, they are owned by Il Fornaio. I had the seafood risotto everytime and its freaking delicious! Long wait so make a reservation. Love this place,  stars for sure!"
1,Met my husband here and  years later we had our wedding reception here! Great food got a lot of compliments from our guests and very accommodating to our  guest party! nThanks so much for helping make our special day even better!
1,"I took advantage of Thats A Wrap for their catering services yesterday and once again, was totally impressed!  I called around am for a pm delivery... I wanted to make sure that those of us who were working at the Phoenix Art Museum all day preparing for the pARTy had some fuel to get us through the evening.  Sure enough, Thats A Wrap delivered  literally and figuratively.  nnI ordered a platter of assorted sandwiches, fruit, chips, cookies, and bottled water  it was perfect!  Everything was delicious!  It arrived right on time and it was all labeled so it was easy to figure out what you were eating.  I had the Godfather wrap Salami, ham, and provolone wrapped in a honey wheat tortilla with lettuce, tomato, red onion, sun ndried tomato mayo and a drizzle of olive oil.  I dont usually choose salami and ham but for whatever reason, this is the one that sounded best to me yesterday  and it was!nnThanks Thats A Wrap for fueling me and all of the yelper helpers for the pARTy... Ill be back to visit soon!"
1,"This was our second time staying here. We originally planned to to stay at the Venitian but we were upgraded to a suite at Palazzo, on the rd floor and facing the strip. The wife and I are definitely in love with this hotel. I dont see what some of the complaints are of this place. Our wifi was free, fast and easy to get on. The rooms are large and a great deal for the price. Its always great to be in the center of the strip too, its easy to get to almost anywhere. As long as its on the strip. The restaurants, bars  clubs are all great in this hotel. I dont swim and I hate going to the pool, but since my wife really wanted to go and didnt want to go alone, I decided to grab my ipad to read by the pool. Even though Im not a fan of pools in general, I am a fan of this one. In the middle of the day, seats are hard to find but they have numerous pools to choose from. The staff all through out this place is very pleasant and helpful.nnThis place is just straight up classy in all ways...and we love it. The casinos arent filled with neon lights. There isnt anything that tries to attract customers i.e. Volcano, Pirate Show, Giant Fountain, etc., theres not even a buffet, its just a great place to be."
1,Located right in the Golden Nugget hotel this little Italian caferestaurant surprised us with their quality and service. The place gets pretty  packed around dinner time. They offer room service too.
1,"I went on a Wednesday afternoon with absolutely no crowd , no wait and very prompt service . My bf and I were brought in by a pay  get  worth of food GroupOn that I had purchased on my phone earlier that day. We both ordered the Juicy Lucy and it was great! DEF recommend to everybody who wants a good juicy burger at a decent Price. Also got a strawberry shake which was excellent and the fries decent too. nnThe only problem I had was that for WHATEVER reason my groupon said processing  still when I got there and wouldnt reveal a code that the waitress had to type to save us the  so we couldnt use it. She also said the same thing had happened to a girl a few days before and there was nothing she could do about it . This was actually enough to SIGNIFICANTLY piss me off even if it was just  it was just the principal of the thing . Anyways . No clue if this is souly a group on issue or applies to this group on in particular but just make sure your group on actually processed before going !  I got an email saying it had been processed but it wasnt  nnAnyways ...Id still go back but only if I had planed on spending  for lunch p"
1,"I cannot put into words how impressed I was with Sierra Bonita! Absolutely everything about this place is epic! We went in on a Saturday night and were seated almost immediately which was a relief since its such a busy night for restaurants. Our waiter promptly came over to our table and was super polite, wellspoken, and knew the entire menu off of memory. My husband and I brought another couple with us and we all had different dishes. We all tried each others and were in food heaven. Everything was perfection. I had the buttermilk chicken which is one of their most popular items. It has a bit of a kick to it so be for warned. The sweet potatoes are the icing on the cake for this dish. Another if us had the carne asada and it was too notch quality meat! It burst with flavor. We always enjoyed their black tea and some wine. The prices are fantastic for the quality you get here. The ambiance is candles and soft lighting with light background music. The wood decor throughout the restaurant finishes setting the scene and makes you feel at home and comfortable. I recommend geting the smaller portions being that its still a lot of food! I cant wait to go back here ago. And bring new friends! It is a MUST go!!"
1,"My friends and I discovered this great retro arcade and pizzeria place last night. FYI, they have moved down the road to this  Monona Drive address, in a little cluster of shops. Dont go to the  Frost Woods address, as it is now a Salad Creations.nnOh my goodness, I fell in love immediately. The space is cozy, the clientele is hip, and its a cheerful buzz of retro game noise and folks making pizza. I split a  inch pepperoni with a friend, and it was just enough for the both of us. When you order, they ask if you want your pizza cut into squares or slices, which is a nice touch. Squares for me. The pizza turned out to be a thin crust with plenty of cheese, a bright tomato sauce, and sprinkles of oregano to top it off. Its pretty addictive. I also ordered some Bosco sticks, and while the cheese was a little cool, they satisfied my cheesy breadstick requirements. You cant go wrong with a scoop of Chocolate Shoppe ice cream for dessert. However, the counter service was pretty brusque, which was offputting.nnTheres an excellent selection of arcade games, and no worries, theres a change machine for your  and  bills. Most of the arcade games are only  or  cents, so you can have a lot of fun on a little money. Heres just a sampling of the original arcade games I sawnnPacman nMs. PacmannQbertnBurger TimenDonkey KongnSuper MarionRampagenJoustnStreet FighternPinball machines including Dr. Who!nPaperboynnThe pinball machines are in the black light room, which is a lot of fun. I truly enjoyed this place. Its a fun retro arcade with great prices and delicious pizza."
1,"Wow, I was surprised at how fresh the fish is here and how tasty the rolls are.  The lovelove doesnt sound good but I promise its amazing!  I have tried the bento boxes, nigiri raw fish over rice and rolls, everything has been delicious.  I travel quite a bit and rarely find a sushi restaurant in a land locked city this good.nnI will be back and highly recommend."
1,"I am so relieved to have a new local bar. I have been there quite a few times and I must say its the new hot spot. They have shuffle board, pool tables, darts and a dance floor. The crowd is pretty good on a friday or saturday night mostly people in their mid ss. The waitresses and bartenders are very friendly and attractive. This is an awesome place to go for UFC. No cover, tons of TVs, cheap beer and the food isnt bad either. I got the pork bones and Id definitely recommend them. Youll probably run into me when you go."
1,"Went here for lunch and was blown away by their sandwiches. I must admit while roaming the area looking for the restaurant, the neighborhood had a character that almost made me turn around. I mean I like your average barefoot, toothless, bearded guy as much as the next gal, but maybe not joining me to grab a bite.nMy friends tenacity prevailed and we found eat, once inside we were glad we had stayed on course. The ambiance is great! Think modern, casual, and fun. Service was prompt and knowledgable. We ordered the posole soup to share as a starter. It was great, the broth was flavorful and it came with all the traditional garnishes and was chock full of yummy hominy. For lunch he had the grilled cheese and tomato soup and I had the arugula salad. The salad was meh, but I ordered wrong. If you come here you MUST get a sandwich! Let me repeat MUST.  The grilled bread is insane, like you take a moment before you devour because it is so perfect. Get any sandwich, any, and you will be happy.nNeedless to say, Ill be back, and order like a pro."
1,"The only drawback to this hotel  its not on the strip.  Otherwise, I LOVED it.nnThe Palms Place is completely remodeled.  You feel like youre walking into a W hotel or something of the like.  Its sleek, modern and hip.  The rooms are suites  they have a ton of windows, full kitchens and large bathrooms with big tubs.  The beds are so comfortable and there are even  TVs in the room.nnThe Palm Place is connected to the Palms by a skywalk.  Its a  second walk to all the restaurants and casino in the Palms but, there is not a casino in the Palms Place.  I loved that fact because you felt like you were in a little oasis away from the craziness, overstimulated world of the casino. But a  second walk and you were there.  nnThe restaurants in both the Palms Place and the Palms were fabulous.  In fact, you really didnt need to leave the hotel but a cab ride to the strip is just a few bucks.  The gym and spa were beautiful and had all the equipment you could ever need.nnI would DEFINITELY stay at the Palms Place again."
1,"Great food, great service. Obviously fried chicken isnt the healthiest food on earth, but once a month I get that craving for good fried chicken. Their chicken is great, doesnt seem too fatty, and their sides are excellent too. A"
1,"I feel lucky to have this place in my neighborhood and so close to where I live. They have great food, a nice casual atmosphere and half off bottles of wine on Mondays. I love this place. I have never received less than excellent service at Grape Street. There is a reason it has been open so long. This is definitely my favorite casual dinner spot in town."
1,"Normal Dutch bros!! Not quite the same as my trusty McQueen Dutch bros but these guys still rock!! Love the coffee and other drinks. Super friendly staff and they always great you with a smile! Id be fine with making this my daily stop if it was my neighborhood. Try some of the blended drinks! You can always ask for sugar free, caffeine free and fat free if you want!! Happy Coffee days!"
1,"Awesome! Ive only had their drip coffee. They definitely use quality beans, are quick, super friendly which is always nice, but certainly a plus if you havent had your morning fix and always appreciative of even a . tip the balance from a . large. All of his combined with the fact that they are a local buisness makes spending money on coffee vs. making it at home worth it."
1,"Finally, an AYCE sushi spot that has variety, fresh sushi, great service, and the whole menu is included. Its a bit of a drive from the strip but worth the trip, especially for their sweet shrimp, Toro, and salmon belly sushi.nnThe best part is its only . For what they serve its totally worth it. Youll spend that inside a hotelcasino cafe easily."
1,"Im sorry to see that others have had a bad experience because ours was nothing but good.  We were at another furniture place prior to walking into the Pruitss on Alma School Rd.  The other place, their sales associate was on our heals at all times.  Thats what drove us straight out of there. Glad we did go to Pruitt, no hassle shopping without a doubt.  Sam was our sales person. He let us know if we needed anything to let him know.  I LIKE shopping like that. He literally had the sale within  minutes. nThe delivery guys that delivered our sectional were courteous when they called and when they showed up, they were in and out within  minutes. I cant thank them enough. They even had to go around our home, thru the backyard and bring it into our home thru the back. Didnt even complain about it. Thank you Pruitts"
1,"It was freezing in PHX. OK, well for a bay area guy going to the desert it was cold! We were looking for a lunch place in old scottsdale and found this place. We were so happy. A cozy, friendly place with lovely, warm service. nThe food was good for what it is. They also do karaoke at night which we missed. Well be back the next time for that.nnIf you happen to be there, definitely try it out!!!"
1,"This is it.  Go here when you are in Madison.  The burgers are good, but its the fried food with their GARLIC DIP  that is the best part.  Cheese Curds are a requirement or you didnt actually go to DDD."
1,"I would really like to say  whole stars and for effort, they are easily  stars of nice here, but overall, there was a few issues.nnThe chicken was really FREAKING good, like go there to eat it, forget about the karaoke good.nnHowever, we came to sing, and sing we did.  Well, kinda. The equipment kept getting wonky, and the song selection was whack, you can see clearly the other Yelpers that were there with me, and the only difference I think was my heavy interaction with the staff, and all of that was top notch.nnOverall, I had a good time and they really did go above and beyond for us and the atmosphere there was a fun party WOOO HOOO that hot Paul Pope style art in the bathroom was nice and open so late that well, try it and order the chicken but dont go expecting the nicest set up and song selection and I think youll be pleased."
1,"Food was delicious! Our waitress was right on with all her suggestions.  Good music, ambience, and food.  Also, the manager came out and gave us a special happy anniversary treat! It was such a nice surprise! Sushisamba made our anniversary dinner a special one."
1,"I wish there was a Hash House in CA because it was so good! My group ordered mostly the corned beef hash and the meatloaf hash. I think I was in heaven when I started eating it. The portions were great too. All of us had food leftover to take home. Each hash entree also comes with fruits and a biscuit, which I didnt even get to because I was so full from the actual entree. You must go here and eat if you are on the strip! I guess the one bad thing is that the wait for the food was really long but it was so worth it!"
1,"Best BBQ Ive tasted hands down! Brisket was juicy, flavorful, and you dont need the BBQ sauce! I usually dont like anyones BBQ except my moms lol. But this place is ridiculously BOMB! Pork ribs...fall off the bone. Tender, juicy and great spice rub! The spicy BBQ sauce was awesome not spicy at all for me bt it was really good! I dont eat grits bt they have this jalepino cheddar grits SO GOOD! Anyone here in phoenix NEEDS to go try this place! So happy my brother took me here!"
1,"Easily my favorite Thai restaurant.   Every time I have been there, the staff is friendly and welcoming.   They will prepare your dish as spicy as you want, I enjoy really spicy food and they do a great job accommodating my request.  I usually either get shrimp or scallops with my dish, and they always are fresh and high quality.   I did not have an issue with the portion size.   I had plenty of food on my plate and left satisfied.   The food has a very clean taste and does not leave you feeling too full and uncomfortable.   I will definitely continue going here and will recommend it to anyone looking for a good Thai restaurant in central phoenix area."
1,"Took my parents to this location Christmas Eve for lunch.  Personally Im a big lunch person because you pay less for almost the same amount of food as dinner time.  That aside, Ive been a long time fan of Portofinos SouthPark, Ayrsley  Eastway locations. There are days I literally CRAVE their pasta Mediterraneo I always order mine with capellini.  For , you cant beat this.  Chopped seafood definitely has calamari in it with mussels and all stirred up in a creamy pink sauce... this is my FAV pasta choice.  And yes, I almost always order this dish, which is soooo against my normal rule of trying new things.nnDont forget their bread, which is baked freshly... and a little tip dip it in their house salad dressing!  OMG... its awesome! NOTE if you are allergic to garlic, or dont like garlic, or dont want to smell like garlic, dont attempt this... but then why on earth are you in an italian restaurant?!nnTheir other dishes are good too.  Pizza is huge, and was told to be very authentic NY style.  At my old work we used to order them for lunch, and the cheese would slide all over the place by the time I got it back to work because its so fresh and hot hence Im not a pizza delivery personnnThis location isnt as fancy looking, but its close to my home.  For more romantic outings... you may want to drive a little further to the Park Road or Ayrsley location."
1,"Me and my girlfriend were spending a friday in vegas, and while everyone went out to party and club and what not, we decided to go on a nice dinner date together, we finally decided upon Sushi Goyemon. The feast that followed was one for the ages..nnWe chose this place because the high rating, the deliciously fresh looking pictures and the proximity to mgm signature and the strip. This exceeded any sort of expectations we had that night. We had no idea this was an AYCE joint and had i known, i may have put up a small fight as to going here, but Im glad I didnt because right when we sat down at the bar of course the very personable sushi chefs threw the AYCE idea at us and we didnt know if we could really eat our moneys worth. But Sushi Goyemon has you covered! You dont have to order the AYCE which is basically the whole menu including the specials but if you happen to order more than the cost of the AYCE, they automatically make it AYCE and you can eat and eat and eat and eat! And eat we did..nnMy girlfriend is still pretty new to all this raw fish stuff, and she enjoyed this experience every bit as much as I did. I told her, Dont worry, if its fresh, youll love it! and love it she did!! every single piece, all  hundred pounds of her wolfed down that sushi like she was Oprah at thanksgiving!nnIf I even began to go down the list of delicious morsels we had that night this would end up a dissertation but I will say that that all of the fish was really fresh, the service was awesome and were here a week after that meal still thinking and talking about our experience.nnP.S. They call it an orgasm salad for a reason.. order it.."
1,"This hotel is in a great, central location in Montreal. Close to Chinatown and old town, too. nnIts a super chic and modern hotel. The lobby is incredible with the faux fire place, long couches, and ample areas to lounge. The glass wall leads into the dining room of the hotel restaurant. Super strong and free wifi in the lobby areas and in all hotel rooms, which is so key to tourists and yelpers alike nnRooms are clean and super spacious. Ample closet space, coffeetea maker, and even a refrigerator but not mini ref here with expensive drinks and snacks.  The flat screen tv can be adjustedtilted for your viewing pleasure. The bathroom is fully stocked with the Philosophy brand products shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, and locationnnStaff was friendly and helpful. We had lots of questions regarding how to get in and around the city, and provided us tourists with useful information.nnGreat Montreal hotel and decent prices in an awesome area. Id definitely recommend this hotel and would stay here again in a heartbeat.nnOui Oui!"
1,They did a fabulous job. I was seated quickly and given a list of services and prices to look at while I soaked. I picked the Spa Pedicure and got two extra services for  instead of . The environment is clean and calm and the service was not rushed. I will be coming back here again!
1,"I was really impressed with the Mirage. I had been here so many times but never actually stayed here.  We arrived about  PM on a Thursday night, check in was smooth. nnStayed in a one bedroom suite at the top floor, score. The room was beautiful, the attention to detail was amazing. It was enormous and the bed was so comfortable. There was a bar with mini fridge. They even provided a martini kit. The bathroom was ridiculously large, like it was much larger than it needed to be. It was funny because there were all these amenities like scope and a shaving kit, but when I asked for a comb, they said Id need to get one from the gift shop, ok... nnService was really good as well, except that we needed a rollaway. The first night, it never came. We were so tired, the two people who were going to use it fell asleep on the couches. The next night I called for it early. We got in at  AM, and it still wasnt there. I called down to the front desk very assertively, and it was there in  minutes. nnnValet is free for those who complained about parking, and its really convenient to everything, not that you even need to leave the hotel. Theres so much to do there. nnOverall, I was really happy, and would definitely come back. Much better than my last MGM experience at the Aria."
1,"Fopp in Rose Street is the place to go in Edinburgh for any music or movie lover! After the closure of the Fopp branch in Cockburn Street, this branch has, since then, been my number one place to spend large amounts of time staring at CDs which cost as little as ua!nnWith the impact of online music sales and file sharing, record shops have declined in recent years but it is good to see that Fopp is always buzzing with indie teenagers or movie anoraks! I always like to buy CDs or DVDs from an actual record shop as I prefer to actually have a CD case and cover in my hand! nnFopp, to me, is the indie alternative to HMV, even though they sell the same products HMV actually owns Fopp also! I love spending hours in there buying foreign films for a fiver, or getting some obscure Nick Cave album for ua! nnI guarantee you will find a bargain in Fopp, so go on blissfully wonder about this shop for hours and enjoy yourself!"
1,"I went to Janmichael for a Brazilian blowout and cut last May because there was an awesome Groupon deal. I wasnt sure what to expect, but I was blown away by Janmichaels skill. Usually people see my crazy curly hair and are unsure how to approach it but Janmichael got to work right away without complaint. He asked exactly what I wanted and followed it to a tee. My hair came out the perfect length, with bangs that framed my face perfectly I had never had bangs before!, and it was completely straight. nnUnlike other Brazilian blowouts Ive had where the stylist does the treatment and then puts me under a blowdryer, Janmichael dried every strand by hand  which just shows the dedication he puts into his work. nnIf you need any type of hair treatment or cut, I HIGHLY recommend you go to Janmichael at Polish n Style. He is professional, personable, and dedicated to his customers and his work! I wouldnt go anywhere else in the PhoenixScottsdale area!"
1,"I think I may have experienced the best burger of my life here!! Ive been wanting to come back here since my last trip, its that good. A lot of vegas restaurants are overrated, but this is a goto spot. Make your burger how you like it, any ol way! Fried zucchini and Onion rings are also fantastic!"
1,"I organized a dinner at Sage for my husbands th birthday. The service was impeccable, friendly and they didnt take themselves too seriously a huge plus in my book. The food was divine without exception. This is a lovely place for a special dinner out on the Strip, expensive but not outrageous for the quality. Well done!"
1,"Excellent !!! looked up the place before our trip to Colorado, decided to stop in Phoenix for dinner.  We had a  min wait, but it was so well worth it, the food was amazing!!.. the owner was very kind and started us on drinks while we waited for a table.  The staff is very courteous, the food is phenomenal.. the price is a little up there, but then again its not your local Taco shop, this is definitely gourmet tacos at its best.  I loved their Shrimp tacos!! and of course their cochinita pibil quezadillas were lickity good.. everything on the menu looks very very good."
1,"If youre looking for good, fast, cheap pizza, this is the place.  Not a typical pizza joint.  Its the Noodles and Company of the pizza world.  Pick one of their main creations or make your own.  Pasta and salads as well.  Personally a much better bangforyourbuck then CPK.  Great place to take the family in a pinch or whenever.  Recommended by friends last time they were in Scottsdale  and I can see why."
1,"We came here on a whim, and glad we did. Last night, we watched Jiro Dreams of Sushi, a documentary on one of the best sushi chefs in the world, and suddenly, we had a craving for sushi, so it was convenient that we were driving by this place on the way back from CostCo. Weve driven past this place several times, but never had a chance to try it out. nnBeing a Sunday, the place was not crowded at all. Luckily it was happy hour from pm, so sushi rolls were discounted as well as drinks. I asked for a Kirin Light, but our waitress said it was only available in a  bottle, so it would be a better deal for a  more to get the Sake bomb and get the extra beer plus sake. In the spirit of enjoying my lazy Sunday, I thought, Why not? and went for the sake bomb! nnA particularly unique roll that we enjoyed was the Lollipop Roll. Im learning that it doesnt matter what sushi place we go to, specialty rolls all seem the same to me, just with different names. A Tootsie Roll may have shrimp tempura there while here, it was spicy crab with ponzu sauce instead. The Lollipop Roll took us by surprise because it was literally designed like a lollipop, the rolls were on sticks. It tasted really good as well!nnThe Love Love Roll was pretty spicy, and I think that is due to the fact that it contains their spicy tuna, which was extra spicy within itself. You could actually see the large pepper flakes the kind you sprinkle on your pizza in the spicy tuna mix. My mouth was on fire! Its good thing I had sake and Kirin to cool it off! Despite the spiciness, the texture and taste of the tuna was pretty fresh, but I had to see for myself that this was true, so I proceeded to order nigiri  maguro tuna, sake salmon  not the rice wine, and unagi. Today, all were quite fresh. nnTo further test our sushi experience, we asked if they had Uni sea urchin or Toro fatty tuna. The waitress and chef said that they had neither. The reason was that most people do not order Uni or Toro or rarer types of sushi. They said that these types of sushi are more expensive and it goes to waste if people dont order them. However, they did redeem those explanations by saying if we called a few days in advance, they would make the effort to orderpurchase Uni, Toro, or other types of fish ahead of time and prepare it once we planned to come in. nnOverall, they made our afternoon! We were very happy we got to try out their place, but I fear from reading other reviews that had we gone at busier times  persay a Friday or Saturday night, our experience might have not been as great as today. Because I like supporting local businesses and love that sushi is becoming more accessible on the west side, we will continue to go here, because Im curious to see if they continue to improve which I really want them to and continue to surprise us."
1,"This airport is the absolute best. The layout is grand and spacious relative to the Strip, its so convenient and to the surrounding residential parts of town as well there are always enough TSA agents so the lines move quickly. And, if you didnt get your gambling fix while you were there, there are slot machines in the terminals. nnAnother great thing about Vegas."
1,"This is a fairly regular stop for me downtown at lunch. Nickys Thai kitchen offers a large menu and quite frankly great prices and portions for being in the city. nnI went with the Cashew Chicken , spicey level . If you are a dare devil you can really go hot in this place but I dont need any rumbling tummy the rest of the day. They start you off with a tasty salad with sweet dressing. As for the lunch, just look at the picture.  The plate looks divine, the taste is great, service is easily under a hour at lunch. Plus the look of this place is neat.  Add it to the rotation or visit when you head downtown."
1,With every bite of my breakfast enchilada I would forget I was in the middle of my . hour layover having breakfast at an airport eatery.   nnIt took a little longer than I like for someone to come over and take my drink order but the waitress made up for it by being very attentive and knowledgeable of the menu.   Very tasty and way above the norm of what youd expect to get at an airport.
1,Daniel does an awesome job of delivering great food and outstanding service. nThe wine list is not your usual suspects but a wonderful offering of affordable reds and whites.nThis is a great place to celebrate and even better place to just enjoy great food.
1,"Perfection! This hidden gem that has been here for years is truly As good as it gets!. The orange beef is filled with beautiful and toothsome orange pieces. My partner swears by their General Tao and has his entire office hooked. They no longer order Chinese, they order Fang Chi. The variety and number of dishes available will please your taste buds and your wallet. The cashew chicken is filled with surprises as their simple wonton soup is actually filled with wonton! A must try are their fried bananas for dessert. Their delivery range is smallish but you can always pickup tremendous meals to take home."
1,"Ive been here a million times, and I will be here a million more. It would be perfect if I never have to hear another person nearly ruin my butter buzz by uttering, A moment on the lips, forever on the hips while Im inside."
1,"Went to the show Jersey Boys yesterday afternoon.  Absolutely terrific, what a show.  My era and I knew most of the songs.  Had forgotten how many hits The Four Seasons had.  We had a great time and the guys and girls on stage were given a standing ovation.  Well deserved too.  I would recommend this absolutely.nPlayhouse itself needs more Ladies loos where doesnt? and getting out of the theatre if you are anywhere near the front of the stalls is a nightmare.  Took about  minutes  just as well we had the choice of later trains."
1,"Loved it. Great atmosphere,  server, staff, and especially the food!  We had the crab cake appetizer, pulled pork chile verde, and the Double Dog Dare bacon wrapped, two franks, as well as a tasty IPA they had on tap.  We will definitely stop here again, and plan to visit other Michael Mina establishments in California."
1,"Great environment  sleek decor. Food from rural China skillfully brought to Vegas with panache. nWatch the cook throw dough around and make noodles and then order it.  nI come here everytime I stop by the Caesars Palace, even when Im not hungry. Since Im staying in CP this time, my second time eating here in  days."
1,I have been here a few times and they have a good selection on streetwear items. The prices are decent and they usually have some really good sale items. The staff is really chill and helpful and the overall atmosphere of the store is chill.
1,"While I dont care for the teriyaki sauce they use on the chicken, I do like their sushi rolls. My favorite is the rainbow roll with no eel only salmon and yellowtail. Compared to higher end sushi places the prices are good and so far the sushi has been just as  good."
1,"A lot of shows around Las Vegas rely on a lot more than the characters on the stage to make the show spectacular.  In the case of Toxic Audio, the characters are all that this show has, yet it remains spectacular...and then some.nnFive acapella singers comprise Toxic Audio, one of whom is the original member of the group that was started back east.  Each artist has their own niche, from the eclectic lead to the large, footballplayer looking baritone and the sweet, perky alto.  The two women and three men all perform throughout the entire show with nothing but their voices and bodies a little loop is thrown in for a backing track, but its still her voice.nnInteraction is expected from the crowd, ranging from clapping along to actually getting up on stage to channel surf with the cast watch out for those adult channels!.  The show is about  minutes long and is perfectly timed in the early afternoon for strip visitors pm most days, Ive seen it at pm as well.  The cost is relatively inexpensive check www.goldstar.com like Susan R. mentioned.  nnI have heard the rumor they may be losing their spot at the Planet Hollywood V theater tough times for a lot of acts right now, so go see them while you can."
1,This is my favorite beach locale on the Strip  even if they keep the sharks in their own attraction rather than having them in plexiglass pens next door like in the Golden Nugget!  nnThey have a giant wave pool and a reasonablysized lazy river tubing course.  And the Border Grills right next door!  The only possible downside?  All those conventioneers walking through the concourse staring at you floating down the river...
1,"It is  AM and I am hungry. I didnt have breakfast, it is too early for lunch and I am trying to decide whether I want to pull into a breakfast place or a lunch place, then I see the sign that says Lo Los Chicken and Waffles !!. I go inside thinking  I will probably just order lunch but ........ waffles seem to come with most of the choices and besides I am in a Chicken and Waffle house so I order  drumsticks with waffles. nnThe place is clean with friendly and happy looking staff. My food comes and I bite into the drumstick. It is lightly battered not overly and is a little crispy on the outside but tasty and juicy! The waffles are light and you get lots of butter and syrup! I have a bite of breakfast followed by a bite of lunch, this is still a strange combo but very tasty!! nnI leave thinking that will will come back again but, I am still confused, Did I just have breakfast or was it really lunch?????"
1,This truck sells the best NY city style deli sandwiches hands down.nnThe folks parked their truck at Triple C Brewery on a Friday and I was happy they were there.nnI had a pastrami sandwich that was just perfect. This is the first food truck where I wanted to go back to and try everything on their menu.
1,"Sunday breakfast at pm! Yes, I am a fan!nnIf only this place is not hidden in the corner of a building in Civic Center, Id find it a long time ago! There we are, stopped by at pm for a late breakfast, and we enjoyed every bite of our food! nnFreshly squeezed orange juice  yes, not from a bottle or a can, you can taste the freshness, so get a large glass! medium size is the size of the water glass which youll see once the water is delivered to your tablennOriginal French Toast  yummy! nothing special but the original! That is all we need!nnBanana Nut Pancakes  my fav! pieces of banana and pecans hidden in the puffy pancake top with maple syrup! I paired my pancakes with searedfried? prosciutto, saltiness and sweetness all together! can I come back tomorrow?nnSoup of the day  Chili  yes, this cup of chili was spicy!nnService was excellent as we were the last table at the restaurant, we did not feel any rush that we need to leave as the clock ticks to pm when they close. One thing I wish our server had said was that the portion is big. Both the French Toast and Pancakes are very big dishes, if you are not so hungry for a huge meal, share your plate!"
1,"Spicy chicken with brown rice bowl was amazing! Grilled to order, super flavorful! The only reason why I gave it  instead of  stars is because the prices are kinda high. Upcharge for brown rice, upcharge for veggies etc. But its really good food, so Ill be back anyway, just not as often probably."
1,"Awesome fresh burgers, made by hand and cooked to a perfect medium. Fresh cut fries w skin on...super friendly staff. GREAT addition to NLV. Cool hole in the wall.nOnly minuses no fountain drinks or free water and the ordering system is still getting ironed out.n. stars for the amazing burgerfries"
1,"Jill  Wax Appeal is amazing! Her professionalism, wax technique  charming new space is comfortable clean and very inviting for anyone, men included. I have been waxing for years  Jill is at the top of her profession, you will not be disappointed!nShe was flexible with my schedule and really appreciated it!nSharing her name with with friends  family will be easy. nThanks Jill"
1,"Just took  of my coworkers here for lunch.  nnThe place is very cute, the music was appropriate and the food was delicious.  The only complaint is that some of our party didnt get their food until the rest of the party had been served and was halfway done eating, so the kitchen needs to better about timing large orders.  nnnOtherwise it was a pleasant visit.  It cost me about . to feed  people with the lunch special.  Not too bad!nnI think well be back."
1,"From the get go, I knew Presidential Limousine would be a good choice. There reservation system is easy to use and their prices are published online. nnWhen they picked us up and dropped us back off at the airport they were on time and helped with our bags. However, in between those times is why I am dinging them stars. nnThey drivers were great on most fronts, but  our first driver spoke about how he lived in the hood. When you are working for a chauffeuring service that is just something you dont talk about. Luckily, the ride from the airport to the Monte Carlo wasnt too long. nnDespite my negative experience with the one driver I will use presidential Limousine next time I am need of chauffeuring."
1,"Although Studio B is a little far from the strip, it is one most favorite Buffet in last Vegas for the price.  I have eaten here many times and I always to make it a point to eat here when I am in Las Vegas.  I was finally able to make it to Vegas on the weekend when they have the Seafood Buffet, which was nothing much more special than the normal buffet beside having Oysters and Crab.   The Buffet is huge and quality of the food is really good.  California residents also get a discount."
1,"I highly recommend this school to all parents who need daycare. I researched A LOT and this is the place for us. Our son has been going here since he was  weeks old and just celebrated his first birthday. Ms. Richa was his infant I teacher wksmo and he adores her. Ms. DAmbra is his Infant II teacher momo and we couldnt be happier with her as well. All the staff there is amazing. We pay a pretty penny but if you refer people you get some tuition knocked off. They are open ampm so it works with everyones schedule. They have fun family events, date night for parents so you can still go out and they watch the baby and have dress up days and carnivals for the kids. We are super happy and recommend every child to attend this location."
1,I love this place!!!!nnThe Wild West shrimp is the best ever!!! It is the reason why I love coming here.nn.  appetizer  Wild West shrimp nn. entree bacon burger great and cooked well mouthwatering taste with fresh flavornn. fries fresh and delicious
1,"I dont get the complaints.  Its huge, lots of shops and choices, the kiosk people arent overly aggressive or pushy.  Its easy to walk to from the strip.  Its HUGE, but the signs are directories are numerous and the big stores are well marked."
1,"Love this place! My favorite pho restaurant in town, hands down! The service is always so quick and attentive. The food is always up to par, Ive tried almost every dish on the menu and I can honestly say there is not one bad thing. Definetly a musttry if you are visiting from out of town!"
1,"Great location and beautiful property. Customer service during check in was on point. Friendly and very helpful. I had  rooms right next to each other for a BDay getaway. They were spacious, the view was lovely, and it fit  per room comfortably. After getting settled in, my girlfriends and I had a drink at the bar. The staff was wonderful and attentive. Their service was perfect. Mr. Salimi was a joy to converse with and made our stay very welcoming. I must add, the pool layout is delightful and of course refreshing to take a dip in. I would definitely recommend Elara to family and friends."
1,"Went here using a Groupon which is how I discover a lot of new places!. We came in at lunch and were seated on a gorgeous back patio. Service was amazing, and good was also! I had the signature crabcake sandwich and was floored! I love crabcakes, this one was to die for! I actually am craving one now talking about it! I definitely  will be back here! Especially for Wine Down Wednesdays!"
1,"I love, love, love this sushi! I cant always dine in so it is good to know you can call in an order and pick it up, easy peesy! The food is fresh, the service is fantastic, and it is a great place to take people visiting Vegas!"
1,"GREAT PLACE FOR TACOS!!, nReasonably priced for fresh, made to order food. Fish tacos a must, than the beef carnitas, great flavor, loaded with fresh cabbage, also great pico de gallo salsa.nalso cheese enchilada very favorable.nEmployees are very nice, mgr. Steve very customer service oriented.nOverall, a great and economical stop with fresh food, including brown rice and tofu!!nHighly recommend for a quick lunch or dinner!!!"
1,"I was put up here after not making a flight the woman I talked to at the gate blamed Orbitz for not scheduling enough time to make a connection. True. But then a really nice man hooked me up with a voucher for this hotel accomodation!nnI didnt realize that ALL the Embassy suites do the Managers happy hour in the evenings this one was   ...But let me back it up a bit. My whole experience here was wonderful.nnA nice man, Terry, drove the shuttle from the airport and was very helpful giving me some things to do ideas around the area  movie theatre, shopping mall...etc. When we pulled up to the front he even pointed out a restaurant next door,  and CVS. I was super tired from my flight so it was nice that he took the time to point things out since I was not paying attention.nnI went inside and checked in very fast and smooth. The FD clerk even offered me a beverage hot coffeeteacocoa.  She even told me how to access the internet free of charge.  I found my room quite quick and going inside was so refreshing!nnI had an immense amount of space for just me, as these acommodations are suites. The little kitchenette was stocked with tea and coffee and ice machine was just around the corner, not too far of a walk.  It was extremely chilly in the room so after I found the thermostat, I turned it to be warmer I ended up turning it off I was so cold.  I did a quick flip through of TV channels but didnt find anything I wanted to watch. And then I tried to connect to internet fast and easy.  I called to see about getting a bathrobe and some toothpaste and it was brought up in less than  minutes!nnI thought about going sightseeing and ended up taking a nap. I didnt realize how tired I was!  The bed was great! Comfy and warm!  I didnt want to get up!  But I ended up getting up so I could go to CVS across the street for a few needed items.nnNext morning when I left, there was nothing I needed to do to check out and the shuttle service back to the airport was very prompt. nnI wouldnt mind staying here again should I be stopping through town or stuck overnight on an unforseen layover!nnnYelp  Challenge"
1,"I ended up here on a Saturday afternoon because the place we were going for lunch was a long wait and walking back to the car we saw the sign, which worked out perfectly!nnI had never been to a place like this before and the server was super helpful with suggestions. I had the avocado salad and it was amazing and really fresh. For dessert, we shared the sweet potato puddn with vanilla ice cream at the servers suggestion and it was absolutely delicious! I now find myself craving it from time to time. nnI liked the atmosphere as there is a small dining area, perfect for a party of two. There is a very Jamaican feel to the decor and it complimented the menu nicely. I definitely intend to go back and try out some other sections from the menu and get some more of that puddn!"
1,"I LOVE THIS PLACE! Some jazz bars can be pretentious, but this place is literally underground and laid back. There is such a wide range of style in the music and age in the audience that you wont ever feel out of place. I particularly love the Monday night big band, but you can hear fantastic music any night of the week. If youre on a budget, the early shows are free but the covers are usually only  or  pounds. You can get a nice and decently cheap bottle of wine. They have fantastic espresso martinis. The only downside I can think of is that its a pretty small venue, so if its busy it can be uncomfortably crammed."
1,"Been to a fair amount of Chinese buffets and this seems to be the top of its class  a class which could never get  stars just out of principle.nnSushi was very good, vegetables were crisp, soups were tasty and they even made a dozen beef ribs for my friend without sauce hes diabetic.nnPlace is very clean, wait staff is efficient, and prices consistent with the area and quality but not a cheap Chinese buffet."
1,"Another hotel I get to stay for free.. so I really dont know the price.. Even though this is pretty far from the vegas strip but I know some people would like to be in a more quiet, relaxing enviornment. I stayed there all by myself again, I always stay at different hotels when Im in vegas with my family.   but its good in a way, cause I do have my privacy.  .. nnFor da ladies, this is the place to be. First of all all room are suite, even the regular suite are pretty big. then they got the Chippendales show.. LOL.. lastly, end of the night you could go  floor voodoo loungeclub.. wa beautiful view. Its  a pretty fun place to be.."
1,Goyemon is my top AYCE sushi place to go to in town. Their sushi is pretty fresh for being in Las Vegas with no ocean and their service is always up to par whenever I go. The only down part about this place is your full party has to be there before they will seat you.
1,"The reviews complaining about no view, or no restaurant, or no pampering, apparently did ZERO research before booking. Jockey Club is a noncasino hotel, somehow wedged between Bellagio and Cosmo. Jockey Club was here long before either of those interlopers, and for whatever reason neither developer bought the property. So whats left is a small, condo hotel.nnRooms are within closer walking distance to the strip than either hotel mentioned above. Dedicated parking and elevator is in the Cosmo garage. Every room has a FULL kitchen  range, oven, microwave, fridge freezer, coffee maker, dishwasher. Dining area, Walk in closet.  Separate livingsleeping areas. I challenge you to find that elsewhere on the strip, especially at a comparable rate.nnI never even saw a timeshare sales rep.nnMy room was spotless, cleaned and restocked daily, and absolutely perfect. Mind you, Ive spend countless nights in LV at the Trump and Elara, plus forays to Mandalay and Mirage. I know whereof I speak. Elara and Trump offer the full suite experience, but were too pricey for this trip. The other strip casino hotels you get zero amenities in the room unless you book super premium suites, not even coffee.nnBiggest drawback is lack of view and full service. If your thing is sitting in a hotel room looking at a view of the strip, having your every need catered to, then this is not your place. But if you can lay in some groceries, dont plan to spend hours in your room gazing at the view, and can walk a hundred feet to the Cosmo for food and fun, stay here."
1,"George is fun to work with. I had several issues with my home and building project that seemed insurmountable. His knowledge and proffesionalism were a welcome relief. He was prompt efficient, knowledgable and a spectacular value. I appreciate the little extras that come with good solid service, and a sense of humor. I reccomend this business to anyone who wants real value, and a great finished project."
1,"for two nights what more you ask for a great suite and great view. I have never seen so many tv screen in one room! I will definitely book a room for my next visit in Las Vegas. I had a relaxed stay, friendly staff and the best of all the casino isnt as smokey as the other casinos out there.nnWe had  king size bed, remote control for your tv and the curtains? Nice"
1,I always passed by this place but last week I met up my aunt for lunch. This place has a great atmosphere and very friendly fast service! I had the rosemary chicken sandwich... Its was AMAZING! Perfect mixture of savory and sweet! Ill be craving this sandwich within a week Im sure. The sandwiches come with a small simple side salad with a sweet but not too sweet vinaigrette. Ou can also choose to upgrade to French fries which I would usually do but I was in a healthy mood. The little side salad was the prefect addition to my sandwich which was a perfect amount! My aunt ordered the FEZ salad and added chicken. I stole a bite and it was also soooo good! I feel like this is a place where I could come back and try everything on the menu. nnOur server was extremely helpful and friendly... I give them an A for service!nnIll be back soon to try something new!
1,"Ive been living in Tempe for  years now and Pita Jungle has to be in my top  places to eat at any given time. The ambiance is awesome inside. The art work on the walls is always awesome, for sale, and gets turned every once in a while. The staff is always friendly and attentive. The food is great, fresh and healthy. Ive always ordered something different there and am never disappointed with whatever i get. Although not on the menu, i always order a side of sauteed broccoli which is the best broccoli youll ever have. All and all, this is a great place for lunch or dinner."
1,"I came here to find a Christmas gift. I felt a little reluctant walking in, it almost seemed too fancy for me. However, the service was great and really made us feel at home. He gave us samples of some of his favourite olive oils and vinegars, and didnt pressure us at all. Walked out with a great and unique present. I was really happy with the quality of the product and especially with the quality of service! If youre in the market for a unique gift for yourself, or for the food lover in your family, this is just the spot."
1,I am not a yelper but I am so impressed by Midfirst Bank and this location I had to. I only wish I could give them more than five stars. Every employee is beyond fantastic and their hours are not to even being close to being competed with. Gavin is a very genuinely helpful person and there should be more people like him I am just lucky hes at MY bank!  I am only upset that I did not start banking here sooner and I now wonder why anyone would bank anywhere else. Thanks Midfirst Scottsdale!!!!
1,"We have been coming here for several years and the service and food varies to the day of the week and server. Week days are best, quick and attentive service. Shrimp in chili sauce is one of our favorite but the spiciness varies each time. Flower chicken is good if you like more on the bland side. Pork fried rice is consistently good just wish they could add spouts. Overall this is a fine restaurant"
1,"Stuffed!!!nnAttentive service, bottomless drinks which includes Goose IPA on draft, great prime rib, good selection and all appeared fresh and presented to standard even in last hour of service. nnDefinitely worth a try and for the drinks alone you get your monies worth."
1,"I guess it is only fitting that I write a review for The Bagel Man as my husband just left to grab our breakfast there.  As others have said, these bagels are superb and the service is stellar.  The prices are very reasonable and the food is fresh.  No frufru coffee drinks here just the basic cup, which is fine with me, the focus is on the bagels, and that is obvious.  nnSmall little place and it can get busy, but it seems to go fast.  Get in line, order your food, maybe grab some coffee while you wait.  Pay when it is ready and either sit at one of the few tables inside or sit outside to enjoy the nice AZ weather.nnBreakfast sandwiches, fresh made flavored cream cheese I asked for jalapeno cream cheese and he made some for me on the spot, cream cheese  jalapenos, Boars Head meat for the lunch sandwiches, and some home baked pastries from someone elses home.  nnWith all of the good stuff on the menu, my absolute favorite is the lox and cream cheese on an everything bagel with all the fixins tomato, onion, capers. YUM!  I could go on, but my breakfast has arrived and it is time to eat!nnEnjoy!"
1,"Good spot to get a coffee,  but the attitude of some of the baristas need to remember that they are there to make coffee. My friend and I were both told what we wanted would take awhile instead of saying it will be longer than usual,  its like they dreaded the thought of brewing coffee....aye"
1,"Whats not to love about CM.  You got novelty items to look through, great beer and a deli that always looks fantastic even though Ive literally never tried it.  This location with its new outdoor patio out front really has a following it seems.  We stopped in just the other day on a weekday and the place was packed.nnBe aware the parking out front is weird and you basically have to back into a parking spot.  Strange and awkward.  nnI come here for the beer selection, thats the main reason.  They always have good taps on deck and the bottle selection is equally impressive."
1,"We went here for my friends bday celebration and since some people in our party had access to the frequent stayers card we received really good rates on our rooms. The rooms themselves were very big for the price we paid, complete with couches and chars and tables, and a HUGE vanity area which for a bunch of girls all getting ready to go out in vegas is a huge help!!! there is never enough mirror space for checking out outfits, hair and make up ha ha This hotel isnt on the strip really, but they have shuttles that will take you there during the day so really not as bad as some would think.nnThe restaurants in here were only so so food wise, but one of their buffets carnival i believe was probably the best deal anyone could ever have! For  which seems pricey for a buffet, you get unlimited mimosas with your brunchlunch and all you can eat everything including crab legs, shrimp cocktail, a mexican bar, asian bar, sushi bar...the list goes on and on! I have never felt so full in my life, but a trip to vegas isnt complete without a little buffet action!!"
1,"I like CLT.  This airport is large and has a lot of people going through it, and there are many places to stop in, grab lunch or dinner, and get to your next stop.  I normally dont have much time to hang out here, but I have been to a couple restaurants and they were clean and fast.nnI especially like the fact this airport has six Starbucks locations.  If you are flying FROM Charlotte, try the A concourse TSA line, it is usually shorter."
1,"Last night the boyfriend and I hit up subway and he decided to go nutz with his sandwich. I mean lets try to make sure the sandwich doesnt close hahaha  The guy making his sandwich asked how much of everything he wanted and guess what? The guy actually piled on the toppings, which made me nervous cause Im gonna have to deal with the consequences of my boyfriends gluttony! The guy who made the sandwiches were making us laugh and made the sandwiches EXACTLY the way we wanted them.nnI can still see the sandwich bursting open with hundreds of little jalapeufos! hahaha definitely one of the best trips to Subway Ive ever had."
1,"We have used this business since the early s.  I highly recommend them.  I also recommend the yearly checkup where they take a look at your AC.  Do this in the Spring, and get your AC tuned up for the summer.  We have had the same technician, whos name I dont remember, come out here for years.  This is a family run business that appears to retain its employees over the longrun, and that tells me something right there!"
1,"Went here on the Groupon. Had a nice experience this salon is HUGE. Amy H. Cut and did some color, the blow dry was extra and honestly blow drys make me fall asleep with my long hair. She was super friendly and liked what she did. Worth the money."
1,Mrs Q and myself visited this establishment today and was extremely impressed with the service here.  The atmosphere is pleasant and there was no wait to be seated.  We did arrive at  and the place was pretty full but still the breakfast crowd.  I always love the flavored coffee.  I would highly recommend any of there omelettes or the pancakes.  Mrs Q got the rocky mountain omelette and loved it.nnThe best part of the menu is that it informs you of how many calories each meal has right next to the meal.  This might help you make a well informed decision on what to eat if youre on a diet.nnQ
1,"If you are  the odds are you will love the place. If you want the partytilludrop type atmosphere, you should stay elsewhere.nnOne star subtracted because you have to stay around the lobby area for free WiFi ask for login code at the Front Desk which is very slow to download. I had to cancel my Apps download after trying for  minutes. This should have taken  minutes max. I am glad the Front Desk person advised us not to connect to the paid room WiFi service company mentioned in their property book because the service is very unreliable. This saved me that frustration  , at least.  ATT phone service sucks here. Unable to send emails or IMs via an iPhone S or G. TV has basic channels only. With no room high speed Internet service my DirectTV HBO TOGO service or any TOGO TV service does not work. nnLoved the king size beds and the space. If you like protein for breakfast go someplace else. The AC is literally a blast. In the living room there are  large round vents that can not be adjusted. If you sit or sleep on the couch a vent blast the couch, as the AC cycles. Brrrr! If you adjust the AC to use the couch the bedrooms get hot. If you adjust the AC to get comfy in the bedrooms, the couch area is to cold. We clipped a face towel to the vent using  office alligator paperclips to deflect the air stream toward the floor, since the vents do not move. See my photo. It worked.nnBreakfast is a carbohydrate laden affair big bagels, sweet pastries, strong coffee Starbucks is next door and watery juice. I did not see the fruit mentioned by some others. Take the room coffee cups over or you have to use the small Styrofoam cups provided. If your stomach is on eastcoast time, the AM breakfast start time is to late anyway.nnVery nice pools with sand. BBQ area and tools are a nice touch also. The bus transportation to the strip and a few other casinos is very useful."
1,"Came here for brunch. Best waffles ever!!! Bacon and chive waffles paired with a delicious savory sauce, you cant go wrong. I had high expectations and they were definitely met. I would highly recommend you come early or make a reservation. Kind of hard to get to but worth finding."
1,"Oh my WOW!!!!!nThis place is INCREDIBLE, Just got back from having lunch and was sooooo impressed. Everything was wonderful, the staff was friendly, the presentation was awesome the flavor was delicious but most of all the fish was very fresh. nWe will definately be regulars here!nLOVED IT!"
1,"This is one of my staples. I only go here with a friend and usually run into people I know. Its a great little place for socializing and you have to take a friend in order to get the best bang for your buck. So heres what you should do! One of you order a sandwich I prefer the Frick and another should order a helping of the Nutella pancakes. Then you split those suckers in half and chow down on your  sandwich  pancake meal you just created and wallow in happiness. Its the perfect helping size and the perfect mix of savory and sweet. I cant attest for anything else aside from the coffee of course!, because after doing this once, I never had the heart to order anything else and miss out on this concoction! Highly recommend."
1,"A bar with SHUFFLEBOARD, friendly staff, SHUFFLEBOARD, and creative takes on typical bar food? Im in trouble, since I live only a few blocks away. And love SHUFFLEBOARD!nnCame here briefly last night for a UYE but couldnt stick around. Staff was super friendly, from the servers to the owner, who went out of his way to make us feel welcome, ask for feedback, and allow us to sample menu items.nnHighlight of the menu is the jalapeno fries tempurafried jalapeno strips with a tabascospiked ranch dressing. The light batter mellows out the spice of the peppers, and has a similar effect when used on the fried pickles.nnReally came for the burgers, which are stuffed and topped with additional cheeses, jalapenos, and bacon, in a few different varieties. Unfortunately, I found that the burgers didnt quite live up to my expectations thy were a bit too overloaded and difficult to eat, buns fell apart, and the plethora of gourmet toppingsstuffings PLUS the traditional burger veggies was just too much. nAs for the burgers themselves, the Jalapeno Popper one outranked the Big Mess burger for our group, but we were in agreement that the patties were overcooked.nPartially accepting some blame myself, as our burgers were taken togo, and the steam trapped in the box likely contributed to the buns falling apart. nGood flavors and good value for price though each.nnWill come back for appetizers and SHUFFLEBOARD anyone want to try to beat me?, and likely to watch a few games. Good selection of beers on tap as well."

1,"As others have said, a big draw to this mall is the fact that it is indoor and airconditioned.  They host a National  Geographic Kids Club every Wednesday morning from , which even though my daughter is a bit young to really appreciate, is a really great activity to go out to, to learn, socialize, have fun, and get out of the house!  That being said, if you dont like kids, stay away from the Gap wing of the mall on Wednesday mornings."
1,We came here for my nieces th birthday party. We had a large party of  people and after she said she wanted Asian cuisine we called around the Summerlin area for a place to accommodate us.  We all met here at pm on a Friday and were a little scared that we were the only ones in the restaurant. We were greeted by an older gentlemen who sat us down and immediately took our drink order. We had  kids with us so its hard to sit at a restaurant for a long time. The waiter was very prompt with the food. Everything we ordered was fresh and hot and tasted great. You can bring your own cake for after dinner too. They get their liquor license next month so we will coming here a lot more often. The menu is so vast and the service was great.
1,"Nice staff. Excellent price for laundered dress shirts. They even fold french cuffs for no additional charge unlike some places Ive been to. The drivethru service is pretty cool, too. Would recommend this store to anyone."
1,"This review is for the show O. Before our trip my gf had said she wanted to see it, so I went online and purchased it through the Bellagio website. Very easy process.nWe had seats in the middle balcony second to the last row. Next time it would be better to pay more and sit in the lower section, lesson learned. Couple of the characters came out at the beginning and went through the audience which we couldnt see. nnThe performance itself was pretty good. Although I did doze off a couple times."
1,"Loved it.  Michael Jackson One Cirque Du Soleil is part concert, part circus, and part MJ tribute.  nnThe show does a good job of highlighting the versatility and evolution of MJ throughout his career, showing the true artist he was.  The dancers, circus performers and special effects are great. There are mood changes as they play with your emotions and spoiler alert! the avatar appearance of MJ at the end is mesmerizing.nnIf youre an MJ fan, see this show!  It was a fun trip down memory lane, and made me wish I was a backup dancer."
1,"Great service, great price!!! I love this place!! Hidden treasure!! The prime rib sandwich was the best I ever had!!! The biscuits and gravy was the best and greatest taste!! I love the fun, friendly atmosphere!!!"
1,". meal was perfectly proportioned although the meatballs werent great.nnThe . menu isnt actually on the menu, but is the way to go here. You get one glass of moltopolciano sp, minestrone or garden salad and choice of  pastas  about a large handful. nnThe wine was good. I had the salad, which was drizzled with a nice balsamic vinegarette and spaghetti and meatballs. The pasta was prepared al dente and the sauce was good. The meatballs werent great, but they werent awful. They were also adequate for the price I paid. nnOverall, the meal was a little above average and the price and portions were great. While a little slow at first, the service was excellent. nnI can see a return here."
1,"as far as frozen yogurt goes, this place is the best quality i have found.  it is a little more pricey then most of the places around, but the yogurt and the fruit toppings just seem to be of such better quality."
1,"I had been hearing so many great things about Five Guys from people where I work.  We finally tried it, and we were not disappointed, but it cost about  dollars for a family of four.  Everyone enjoyed the burgers a lot, but they are very messy to eat  I prefer something less messy like a Whataburger or InNOut which are considerably cheaper as well.  I think next time I go I will try their grilled cheese sandwich.  Also, I keep reading rave reviews about the fries.  My all time favorite for fries is still McDonalds but only when they are fresh and hot.  I thought Five Guys fries were too greasy and soggy  but still very good."
1,"I know Lenscrafter has some limited cheaperend frames, but I give it  stars for their service. A few months ago, I bought a pair of glasses and ended up regretting my choice in style and the price was higher than I normally would have gone for. I was able to return it  no problem, no questions, full refund. nnBut what I like best is just their professional atmosphere and care for their customers. All the workers really seem to know what they are talking about and are willing to spend as much time with you until your glasses are fitting correctly  even if they were not bought at Lenscrafter."
1,"I went with my husband on a Monday night, so we had no issue getting a table despite not having reservations.  The concept was explained to us immediately upon being seated you have a coasterlike card in front of you when you flip the green side up, the meat starts coming !, and when you turn it over to the red side, the meat stops, but we had dined at a Brazilian Steakhouse prior.  The only reason Im not giving it five stars, is because I cant help but compare it to Braza, in Connecticut, which I give five starts allaround, but at Fogo, you will not leave disappointed.  The salad bar was fresh, the meat kept coming, we received the meat exactly the way we requested mediumrare to medium, and dessert was on the house.  I had ordered an iced tea, and they even came around with a pitcher and continuously topped it off.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant."
1,"a plate for lunch gets you an all you can eat Chinese food at Krazy Buffet.  a plate for lunch at Panda Express gets you a limited imitation of Chinese food. So this place is great. I didnt like my waitress though, rude and pushy, when she refills my drink she does it so aggressively like okaaaay. When I say thank you not even a your welcome. Most of the customers money that eats there goes to there paycheck so I didnt at least get a thank you. Its okay though because it felt great when I was done and when I didnt tip her. But either then that its all good."
1,"I love this place. They have decent food and drinks at very affordable prices. This is a great place to come with friends and have some drinks. I myself usually have an IPA, and they always have a few good ones. I am told their margaritas are pretty good too. nnI have always have the enchiladas, which I really enjoy, but watch out for those crazy spicy tomato things! Ive never had any of their nachos ironically, but their food has always been great. Their staff is always friendly and on point, and I honestly cannot ever remember having a bad experience at Nacho Daddy. Really great spot."
1,"I was very surprised at the selection and prices of items in the store. My boyfriends dad turned me onto this place. He gave me a gift set of spices for Christmas and I was hooked, the freshness and flavor is something that cannot be matched with supermarket spices. Then when I ran out, I debated buying more for myself. He is pretty wealthy and I am super cheapie, so I thought everything would be expensive. I noticed they have two locations close to me, one in Paradise Valley, and the other at Tempe Marketplace. Their prices are actually the same as spices you would find in the supermarket. But that is where the similarity ends, the difference in taste is worlds apart. They have all the regular spices, and then they have many of their own proprietary spices. Each spice has a label that tells you about the spice and what you can use it for. They sell chili packets so its super easy to make chili. They also sell empty bottles so you can mix your own spices or just save the bottles like I do. nnThey has something called Frozen Pizza seasoning that you add to your frozen pizzas. They sell  cup,  cup,  oz., oz., and  lb bags of seasonings. A  lb bag of garlic will set you back .. You get a catalog filled with their spices and recipes when you checkout. I plan on purchasing the Natural High Fat Cocoa powder and making some of the best brownies I have ever had."
1,"Seriously I could not be more impressed with this company and their rep, Dustin, that came out! Let me start by saying Im  months pregnant and was in meltdown mode when we came home and our AC was not working. After an hour of messing with it we came to yelp to find someone to call. Dukes of Air does not charge anything extra to come out during off hours plus number one. We called at  on a Saturday night and they had someone at our house in less than an hour plus number ! Dustin arrive and was very pleasant despite it being  on a Saturday. He got up on the roof right away figured out the problem and returned to let us know. He carried a binder that read the parts and labor cost for each repair so you know its the same for everyone, plus three. Simple part repair which took him just a few minutes to fix. Once he finished my husband and I asked a slew of questions about why the part broke, what we could have done, and pointers to keep repairs simple. He never rushed the questions and was happy to educate us. It was now  on a SATURDAY! He was so professional and informative. We will absolutely call them on everything AC  absolutely AWESOME!!!!"
1,"Buffet had a large variety, a little bit of everything for everyone. Most of the food was very tasty and flavorful. I Loved the Mac and Cheese! My only regret is not going earlier. We arrived around pm and after the hour wait, it left us with very little time to pig out. I think its worth the money though, we were allowed to stay and eat till pm. Even though it was later there was plenty of everything and it was packed with guests! Desserts were good and service was helpful and attentive. I would go back again in the future, with more time of course"
1,"Yummy fresh ingredients, toasted bread that was delish.  Shakes were good.  The salads were really fresh...but seemed a little boring especially compared to the great sandwiches.  The desserts looked really good but we didnt get anything besides the shakes.  My teen nephews were still hungry after their sandwiches and they dont offer different sizes, but it was perfect size for me."
1,"First and foremost, this is pretty much TRADITIONAL Navajo food. Not any other native american or american indian type of food. It is the basics, because in the real Navajo world, not the material world of Phoenix and urban areas, there is no electricity and such. Its not food all jazzed up with spices and thick sauces, etc, like americans like and desire. Certainly not the salty taste that is american food, or passes for taste. So, in the area of actual Navajo food, the Scared Hogan does it well. As for the expense, its organic as you can get, but thats the Navajo food way, and not advertised and used as a gimmick, like the american food way, hence, its a bit more in cost. An example is, the mutton sheep is bought on the Navajo Nation. Navajos know tis because we cantaste the difference, between a sheep raised on Navajo land vegetation and sheep not raised on it. nAll in all, the Sacred Hogan, is the best traditional style Navajo food served in the greater Phoenix area, except at my house, haha."
1,"I am from NY and I stand by the food here at Crust. Being from NYC I know good pizza and they are awesome. Also a  for  carry out. What a deal. They are the best place around. So all the haters that wanna complain... go to olive garden then. Nobody needs you at crust. I go there every week and it is awesome. Keep it up. Friendly staff, good food, cozy joint. Must visit.      D from NYC"
1,Its fun...nThis place has live shows and lots of little shops to spoil yourself with. I got ice cream and and burger. And I sat and watched a few acts for free that they offer. Its like being at the circus and all the employees are extra nice. Hmmm I got popcorn and they gave me a huge free water with ice! I liked that they have a lot of nickel machines to play slots. This is a nice place to hang out I will be back ASAP. This place is cool it does not break ya bank and most of all you will have a nice time if your with family its super kid friendly and family focused.
1,"I am not sure if Bill Tait is a new manager of Best Buy East Madison or not but if I have to rate my satisfaction as a customer on a scale of , I would say a . I bought a tv from bestbuy.com for our bedroom and due to being so busy at work and summer vacations and have to hire somebody to install it, I did not have the chance to open the tv from the box till just this afternoon when this person is about to put it on the wall after the wall bracket was in place. Apparently, the way the tv is being packaged as I looked at the same model Samsung LED smart tv replacement I just got from the store , there was no styrofoam styropor in place in the upper middle part of the tv to protect it inside the box. So if the upper middle part of the tv  box is banged to something really hard, the tv would have the tendency to be cracked in that upper middle area. That is what happened to the tv I purchased. When I called bestbuy.coms customer service,  of them just told me and my husband that they cant do anything as more than  days had passed after purchase date  and that it is their policy that they could only replace it with  days.  I totally understand that, but my point is that they could have at least checked my credibility, looked at my account as well as my husbands  I guess we are  preferred bestbuy reward members or whatever they call it, checked  the packaging as I tried to explain it to them how it was packaged or if not, at least tried to refer us to somebody who could help. I was really upset about this incident that I was even thinking of consulting it to a lawyer. But anyway, I tried calling the credit card company to have it disputed and was told to return first the item to the store. I followed the advice, asked for the store manager and that is when I was able to talk to Bill Tait. He did investigate the damage and explained to me their policy but then said that being a preferred customer  best buy rewards member that he will consider it and if I want to have it replaced, Ican do so as long as they have available same model. I opted to get a replacement. This meeting with Bill even just took less than  minutes and my issues had been resolved right away. This is true customer service. Bill just made our day! I just felt that our issues are being taken cared of. I usually buy online with almost everything, but I promised myself now that if my purchases to Bestbuy store Madison East would help increase their sales, I would do that as nothing could beat the satisfaction I have gotten from Bestbuy store Madison East team"
1,"Sleepy Poet is great fun.  Lots of vendors, lots of stuff.  It takes hours and hours to get through it all.  I managed to do a good portion of my christmas shopping here over the course of a couple of days.  I found some really fun things that were well received and definitely one of a kind.  The staff is very friendly and they are happy to help you load your finds into your car.  I have been on the waiting list to get a booth here for nearly a year, so if you are interested in selling, there is a wait to do so."
1,great place to hang out upstairs on the patio this time of the year. Their cheesesteak egg rolls are the greatest appetizers ive had there. i normally get the ribeye there which they season and cook just right i order mine rare. The only disappointing meal ive had there was the stroganoff it was really salty other than that definitely a great place to hang out and even watch a football game.
1,"Im still amazed that, yes indeedy, the cost of living in Phoenix is cheaper than the San Francisco Bay Area.    I was amazed to find Airport parking for  a day, even cheaper with a coupon found on the internets. nnOf course, the lot is amidst all the crazy construction near the airport, so I had to navigate the closed streets to find the place.  Service was friendly enough for bored workersthe bus driver kindly waited for me to park my car and get on board...because there werent any other passengers.  It was a quick ride to my terminal.nnMy return to PHX went well also.  Only had to wait a couple minutes to spot the shuttle bus. My car was fine just a little dusty, which was to be expected.  The cashier had trouble processing my couponnot her problem, but the darn computer was acting up.  Manager soon arrivedand he comped my whole stay.   Sorry for the delay, sir, it was only a couple minutes!  Free parking is always good parking, Daddy used to say.nnOverall, I was impressed by their customer service.  Perhaps its just because they are new, but I hope not.  Ill use em again!"
1,"I stayed at the MGM on my most recent trip to Vegas and naturally I wanted to find a place where I can enjoy a casual dining experience. Avenue Cafe provides such an experience. I ate here twice for lunch on my trip. This is strictly my opinion but their lunch menu did not have alot of things that seemed appetizing to me so both times I ordered the grilled cheese dip. Which is a grilled cheese sandwich with a tomato bisque soup for dipping.  Lets just say I ordered it both times because it was that good! The grilled cheese sandwich was great with lots of melted cheese. The tomato bisque was perfect. I am not normally a fan of tomato bisque but this was perfect. The tomato flavor was just right. Not at all overbearing. It was hot and creamy and made a perfect dip. I may make this myself in the future. The first time I was offered a choice between coleslaw and fries for a side and I chose the coleslaw. Opps, because it was flavorless. Nothing but chopped up cabbage and not much else. I took one bite and was done. Thank goodness the grilled cheese and the large dill pickle was enough. The second time around I was not offered a choice and ended up with the fries and since I am not a fan of fries anyways I like very few places fries it was no surprise that when I tried these I was not impressed. But again the sandwich and the pickle are more than enough.nn The prices are typical Vegas in my eyes. Anything you get the price will be inflated in Vegas so my price standards for the Las Vegas Strip are different than most other places. For Vegas I thought the prices were reasonable. The portions are large so you do get some bang for your buck. nnCustomer service both times were excellent. My first visit my server Jose was so sweet. He made me feel very welcome. He watched over me and I was well taken care of. i was alone so I sat in the bar area and was served there and he talked to me and made an effort to have a conversation. The second time I sat in the bar area as well and the waitress was very sweet as well. I cannot for the life of me remember her name but she was great. Both times I felt very welcome and each time I had what I needed. nnI enjoyed this restaurant and I will be back for the same dish next time I want some lunch in Vegas. Yes it was that good. My only real issues were the coleslaw and the fact that they are not open all day like I feel these cafes should be. They are open for breakfast and lunch only. I hear they used to be  hours and it is most unfortunate that they are not anymore. There needs to be more  hour places to eat in these casinos besides whats in the food courts."
1,"My wife and I ate a late dinner here after arriving in Vegas. Beautiful restaurant. Took us immediately to table even though we didnt have reservation. Because of the late hour we split a large New York strip and potatoes au gratin. Excellent steak, potatoes were awesome. Server was highly attentive. This restaurant is definitely on our list when we return to Vegas next month."
1,"one of my favorite restaurants EVER.  nnquality neverything was cooked perfectly.  the only dish that ive ever had there that was disappointing was their lamb appetizer.  Their Foie Gras appetizer was delicious!  It was honestly better than the foie that I got from Picasso in the Bellagio Hands down best Foie.

1,"I went to see Dr. Tammy Lang  was very pleased. She was extremely nice, as was the rest of her staff. She took time during our exam, which I appreciated, and the front desk staff worked intensively with me to find a pair of frames I loved. They have advice as to style, what looked good with my face shape, etc, which was very helpful. Im very pleased to have found this office."
1,Everything about this place I loved! Lindsey was my hairstylist and she was amazing!Very friendly when I called to make the appt. and even sweeter when I met her in person. The salon itself was very clean and modern looking. Plus I like how its not far from where I live. My hair is exactly how I wanted it and it looks even better than I expected. She may be a younger hairstylist but very knowledgable and did a great job giving me what I wanted! Thank you so much again and I definitely will be returning! I have found my salon and my new hairstylist
1,"Heavenly.  On a last minute trip to Vegas this past weekend, the bf made out pretty well and generously offered to pamper me at Bellagio Spa.  I got the minute Custom Massage, where the masseuse customizes the pressure and techniques to your wants and needs.  My masseuse was Mandy, who was an angel with amazing hands.  She made sure I was comfortable, all my requests were met, and put me in this state which she referred to as a the relaxation fog  where you kind of fall asleep from being so relaxed.  It was just great overall.  nnThe spa amenities are quite standard  they have  smaller hot tubs.   were warm and  was cold.  They also had a eucalyptus steam room, which I was able to only be in for about  minutes.  I realized what the cold tub was for after I got out of that steam room.  Teas and other drinks, as well as fruits, were also provided, and I loved grabbing a cup of tea and curling up in the lounge room, reading a magazine until I was ready to hit the shower.  Loved my experience at Bellagio Spa."
1,This may be the best magic show Ive ever seen and Ive seen many.  Its hilarious. Mac is incredible. The tricks will have you wondering how he did it all.  The show has something for everyone. You could take your kids and still be rolling in the isle because the adult jokes will go right over their heads. nnThe show is inexpensive and you get way more than your moneys worth. If youre in vegas and you need something to do during the day this is a must see. If you dont like it there is something simply wrong with you.
1,"My husband and I recently worked with Oscar at Superior Blinds and he went above and beyond to get our project completed within a very small window of time we were building a home from out of state and were only on site for a short period of time. The product looks fabulous Hunter Douglas. Oscar was professional and friendly and we could not have been happier with him, the company or the outcome. Thank you!!"
1,"This is the second time I have been to this place and I love it. It is located in China town and  it is not your typical Japanese restaurant. They dont have a lot of rolls like everyone else. The menu is always changing and you should order from the wall if you like something different. This time around my friend and I orderednnMushroom wrapped in chicken skin I liked this but my friend didnt. She doesnt care for chicken skin.nCold Ramen Noodle This was good. It had chicken, bean sprouts, mushrooms and a few other things in it. I would order this again.nMackerel This fish was good. It was sweet tasting.nTofu Steak Too spicy for me. I couldnt even taste or feel my mouth for a long time.nSeafood Scallop rock and roll two bite sized pieces. These were really good. I would order again. nDeep Fried Bacon wrapped pork tenderloin This was really big. I was expecting bite sized nope not really. This item was just okay. I dont think I would order it again. The first few bits were good but the size of the pork on the stick was big.  nnThe service is okay. They are always busy so you cant always get the best service and just so you know we went at pm on a Thursday and it was packed and people were still coming in. If you have a big party I recommend reserving a table."
1,I was just there and I just had to do a review. I have loved this place ever since my firt time walking through your door. Always the best of ingredients accompamied by the the best staff in the LV area!! This has been the most consistant of a food provider that i have ever experienced! All I can say is ILL BE BACK..possibly tomorrow..
1,"we stopped by here again last night coming back from the airport. since we are now big fans of sashimi, we ordered  of the salmon which is so freaking good, and a couple of their happy hour rolls. nwhats so great about sushi is that its difficult to really stuff yourself. you order a few rolls and by the time you think you may want more, youre stomach starts catching up to your brain or is it the other way around? and you realize youre full....again, good happy hour prices for excellent service and great people watching."
1,I have been with Desert View Medical for almost  years. The attention  care I have received from Dr. Patterson and his staff has been wonderful. He is the doctor who basically saved my husbands life. My husband made a routine appointment for what he incorrectly thought was a strained neck  shoulder. Dr. Patterson gave him an EKG and determined that he might have had a heart attack. An ambulance was called and Joe was taken to Mercy Gilbert hospital and he had a stint put in. Both my husband  I have always gotten any referrals we have needed in a timely manner.   We are now seeing Dr. Lauber as Dr. Patterson has retired. We are still receiving the same excellent care.   Dr. Laubers nurse Eulie always calls us back quickly with the results of any medical tests we have had done. I also think the front office is very nice.
1,"I was at Trader Joes and saw that a new sandwich place had opened I had to try it... I walked in I was the only one there I looked over the menu I went with The Hippie Spinach, tomato, onion, avocado, pickles, mayo, mustard, hot pepper relish, and garlic sauce on multigrain... The sandwich was really good it was really fresh it also came with a chocolate chip cookie it was really good as well... So I will go back for sure along with friendly staff and great food and priced right always makes it a great spot."
1,"I agree with Lindsey R. that this area of th Street has some of Charlottes cutest restaurants. Fig Tree, Jackelopes, and a few others along this way are all located in revamped houses, and it makes the dining experience much more intimate and exciting. nnI usually go for the red beans and rice and the fried green tomatoes appetizer, as theres not a lot in the way of veggiefriendly food...but Im ok with what I get, as its really, really good. nnAnd, since I dont eat too heavy on the entree part of the meal, I have room for the key lime pie. The key lime pie is worth the trip by itself. Its just the right tangy and just the right sweet. Its incredible."
1,"Omnomnomnom. We came here after reading a review on a vegan website. Im the only vegan so we love finding yummy places that have vegan options. nnWe had the new vegan waffle burger, a caramel syrup macchiato with almond milk, a hashtag breakfast sandwich with bacon waffles, kisses waffle, and a strawberry sunrise smoothie. Everything was nom to the max see first line. The sauce with the new vegan burger sandwich was amazing and we loved everything else. nnThe employees were very friendly and we loved playing cards while our food came. Thanks, Tiabi, for a great breakfast and living up to the hype! Well be back."
1,"An absolutely great dinner experience. I went here with coworkers due to other yelp reviews . I got the gnochi and requested to have sausage with it as well. it was absolutely delicious. nnAlso, one of my coworkers is a vegetarian and he wasnt too happy with the vegetarian items on the menu. After a brief talk with the waitress, she came back letting us know that the chef will put together a special vegetarian dish for him. This level of dedication to the customer was a big big bonus."
1,"It was my first time there and I had tons of fun! We came in at about  pm, and it closes at  pm, so we only had an hour to climb, the fault being ours. However, the girl at the register was nice and helped us with all of the questions that my friend and I had. In total, it was only . for both admission and harness, so the prices were great! Since we came so late, the employees decided not to teach us how to use the clips, since it would take too long to do and less time to climb, so we used the autopulleys. Overall, great place if you want to try something new!"
1,"I thoroughly enjoyed the show the two times I saw it.  This is one of the shows that if youre into the premise of the show, you have a smile from the time you get your metal instrument and drum stick until the end of the show.nnAfter being given a drum stick, I was told to choose any item from one of four boxes.  That was what I banged on with the stick many times during the show.  It was great fun and it certainly gets rid of tension you may have.  You just smile and hit away.nnThe group is very talented with their drumming.  I was really impressed with the opening, and I was impressed with the talent of these guys.nnA few months after I saw the show the first time, I had the chance to go again and I took my wife and two friends.  The vote was  to .  My wife was not fond of the show because of the loudness so if thats an issue for you, it might be better if you skip this show.nnOn the other hand, if you want to relive some of the things you did as a kid, by all means, go and see this show and enjoy and jus smile."
1,"Worked out here twice while in Phoenix last week.nnI have NEVER been to a gym with more focused and hardworking members and it was the first time I have EVER been in a gym where more people were training their LOWER body than their upper body!!!nnAs an college athlete, I found this gym to be set up perfectly for getting the most bang for my buck out of my workout, and even though there were lots of people training, I never felt crowded or slowed down. I got more done in  minutes than I usually get done in an   hours.nnAlso, if you are someone who uses trainers, I would recommend checking this place out. The trainers actually knew what they were doing and their clients were clearly getting outstanding workouts. For once I could work out without wincing at the harmful andor useless exercises that Im used to seeing trainers prescribe their clients!"
1,"This is hands down one of the most legitimate of any fighting gyms I have been to. nWhen combat sports comes to mind, some may think of salty coaches with hot headed fighters and mats as nauseating as the staffs egos.  If thats what youre looking for, I would suggest going back to your Uncle Ronnys garage and promise not to talk about rule  again.  nRight when you walk in, you have welcoming staff members who will kindly answer any questions you have regarding ACS and working out altogether. There are amazing coaches that understand that there is a major difference in disposition, as far as what youre there to accomplish. nWhether its getting an amazing workout while understanding the technique of a fighting sport, or trying to take the leap to be the worlds best fighter this place has the knowledge base, experience, equipment, and space to do so. The price of membership is by far the most economical, and classes are dispersed to accommodate all schedules. The facility is clean, and all egos are checked at the door. nThere are plenty of people with different shapes, sizes, and experience levels. If youre embarrassednervous because youve never thrown a punch before, dont worry about it, because there are plenty of people just like you that were at that stage a few days ago.  You probably wouldnt have noticed they just started, because the coaches are, in effect, that good.  nI would highly recommend Arizona Combat Sports to any interested in caring about their well being mentally or physically. If at worst, try it free for a week, and you come out with less fat on your body and have met some really nice people.   nAll that being said, I dont work for ACS, Im just a very satisfied student that is gracious to have such coaches.  If you come in, say hi. Ill be the one in the corner doing the splits on two chairsnnIf you dont know that reference, I believe you can find it by Googleing Jesus Superhero Jean Claude Van Damme"
1,"Wow, where do I start. I miss this place.... nnThe Hummus is the best!nnThe pizza is great!nnThe Wraps are to die for!!!!!!nnThe ONLY thing here I do not enjoy here are the falafels. nnI wish they had there out here in LA, maybe one day"
1,"Topnotch customer service here!nnI didnt use the self storage, but I rented a Penske truck from this location. From start to finish, the communication was great and the service was exceptional. When I arrived the morning of the rental, the owner had it parked outside for me and everything was ready to go. He verified the condition of the truck, explained the best practices for driving it, and even threw in some free furniture pads. I had requested a hand truck and it was already in the truck. All the equipment was in topnotch condition.nnThis experience stood in sharp contrast to the times I have rented from UHaul or Budget. Wouldnt hesitate to recommend this location."
1,"I love Bark Avenue because it lets me feel so good about spoiling my dogs.  I have to confess that my dogs have a blog.  My dogs have a blog that receives  times more hits in a day than my personal blog does.  I am one of those people, I am a crazy dog person, I admit it.  I have  dogs that are as close to kids as I will ever get , so when I discovered Bark Avenue I was very excited.  nnThey only carry premium, high quality dog foods.  Nothing here was made with tainted gluten from outside of the US.  They carry a wide range of treats and chews and for folks who have their dogs on a raw food diet they offer some raw food selections.nnThey also have a great selection of toys, leads, harnesses, beds and accessories.  They have products for cats and birds in addition to the large selection of dog items.  There are no pets for sale here, which as Martha Stewart would say, is a good thing. nnIf you save your receipts after . you receive  off your purchases.  Considering I dont need to be saving for my dogs to go to college or to get their boobs done to fit in with the Scottsdale crowd,  I will probably spend . on my fur kids in no time at all!"
1,"Ive been to many racing schools and experiences, and this one tops them all.nn Dream Racings Ferrari race cars are REAL not an imitation, their cars are serious, yet easy to drive. My ten lap experience was lengthy enough so that my money felt well spent, the instructors were thorough and catered to my needs as a student, nor did the instructors hold me back while driving, I improved substantially in only  laps on the track.  nnMany of these driving experiences Ive been to in the past have made me feel rushed, like they wanted me in and out, and off with my money, but at Dream Racing I felt like a VIP from start to finish. First with an entertaining instructional video, then to my D simulator session with an instructor, and then lastly off to the lounge to get suited up for my laps with a professional racing instructor. This place is amazing, I couldnt ask for anything more except for more laps! hahannIf you want to feel like a celebrity, and drive cars that are faster than anything on the road, this is the place to go, Dream Racing is amazing, and Ill be back for more."
1,"The food was fabulous  vegan, gluten free, organic.  I had the Om Burger which is mushroom, sun dried tomato, flaxseed  mixed vegetables, served on chapati and garnished with tomato, red onion, lettuce, mustard, ketchup  caper auefoli.  It had very complex flavors.  I had the brownie for dessert. My intent was to eat half and save the other half for another day. That did not work out.  I am in Montreal for  days and plan to go back to try another entree."
1,"This Golds is much bigger than the one in Tukee, and nicer too. The employees up front are always nice, there is plenty of equipment to use. They even have a special workout area for women here so girls dont have to feel creeped out by dudes checking them out, which I know is a big complaint for most women at gyms. I want to give it  stars, but the gym is really busy at the start of the week, and most weekdays it can be a little difficult to find a parking space, but thats not exactly something Golds could improve upon but worth mentioning. For mo you cant lose."

My ONLY request is they put more juicesauce over the chicken, but it was delish.nnBoyfriend got a Bellini, their signature drink, which didnt rock his world and a Pizza Margherita which was also thin and nice tasting, but not as mindblowing as Pizzeria Delfina in SF! see my other reviews. nnWe both agreed that not having to wait a jillion hours for a table like every other touristpacked place on the strip was some of the best part!"
1,"Okay so I will let you know up front that Im an old guy at over  and I will tell you that this is the most fun a person can have for their buck!  Especially  in Vegas.  The staff was friendly and courteous and had us watch a quick video outlining the workings of the carts and safety rules.  You get a lap or so to get used to the kart at a slower pace and then they turn the speed on full blast.  Then, hold on to your hats because going mph on a small kart feels more like mph this close to the ground!  I saw a group before us enjoy the race with their kids.  Where else can one go and have this kind of fun with your kids?  Not many places.  Like I said before, for what you pay for a meal in this town you get a full course of absolute fun and thrills.  Dont forget to check in on Facebook and redeem your free Monster drink!"

Everything weve had off the menu has also been fantastic...the primers prime rib sliders served on a toasted pretzel bun are scrumptious and their homemade daily soups are truly homemade delicious.  nnYES its in a strip mall, YES its lacking curb appeal, but make it through the front door and you wont be disappointed...outstanding service and fabulous food!"
1,"OK i did a review for this place when it was called Way Sushi and that place SUCKED.nNow...this place is called RYU Sushi with new ownership and needless to say, my sushi experience there was one of the best Ive had in the Gilbert area. I went with a few of my girlfriends for GNO girls night out night and I was so surprised on how tasty everything was and every single time I took a bite I was just like WOW, this is so goodddd!nnTheir specialty menu is what got to me. All of them seemed so creative and delish! The specialty rolls I ordered was the Boo Ya Ka Roll My favorite, Surf  Turf, Chimichanga, Basil, and their Spicy Tuna Pokie Salad. Everything was fresh and thoughtfully made. The ingredients for some of their special sauces they used in some of their rolls were well balanced and made it flavorsome. Their sushi rolls are pretty big too so its definitely worth what youre paying for. Oh, make sure to leave some room for dessert and try their Pizookie! Yes...I said Pizookie! I was surprised too when I heard this. My girls and I killed it and when I went there again the nd time I took my bf and ordered the Pizookie as well and we devoured the deliciousness. nnRyu, also has great happy hour drinks or specialty drinks! So that is also a plus!nTheir customer service was beyond superior. The lady owner there is super sweet and you could tell she really cares about her customers. She takes the time to talk to every table and makes sure you are enjoying your experience at Ryu.  I love customer service like this nnBy the end of the night after  hours. Our GNO night ended up to be a Food Coma night...LOL. We were so full but happy full nnI highly recommend this place for sushi! I am planning to be a regular here not only bc I want try everything they have on their menu but because they really truly do have great food. Go see for yourself. P"
1,"Truly outstanding food. Possibly the best in the valley. Creative as well as tasty. On top of all that, it is reasonably priced. Great wine selections and nice ambiance. It is also appropriate for vegetarians and even vegans.nnMy only reason for giving it  stars instead of  is that last time I was there, the music was too loud for a pleasant dinner and was a bit like dance music at times. But this is an easy fix and I hope the owners do as it is such amazing food.nnI will definitely go back and will update people on the music."
1,"Posto still delivers as it did when it was called Our Gang a few years back Our Gang is now the name of the sports Bar next door.  We were seated quickly on the Patio and promptly waited on.  Appetizers and drinks were quickly brought out. My wife ordered the gnocci and I had the Cavatappi.  Both were very good, leaving no room for desert. I will be back soon!"
1,"As a lover of Sandwiches, I go to Subway often.  This particular location was pretty good.  The Sandwich Artists here make a decent Sandwich.

1,"This place was so good we went  days in a row and ordered the very same thing!  Banana cream pancakes, cheesy bacon and potato omelette and cheesy grits.  nnOnly a  minute wait on a Sunday morning and we were experiencing this deliousness!  nnService was great, prompt and they refill coffee regularly.  nnHighly recommend!"
1,I have never had a bad time at BlissreBAR. There is always upbeat fun music playing and great specials for brunch. nnI have visited only  times which is not cool because I live fairly close. This is a place that I have definitely neglected. I have been for brunch and my favorite part was getting a little jar of jam for my toast. Also... awesome mimosa deals. I have also been with a big group and the staff seemed to handle it well. There was not a glitch in the service whatsoever. nnI also love the atmosphere in the bar. The decor is very cool and interesting to look at. nnI will definitely be planning an upcoming Friday happy hour at this location.
1,"Had a small get together with some friends before my daughter leaves for Okinowa next week.nnI thought this place was ok, the first couple times see previous reviews but, now have a couple of things to add.nnThe Filet Mignon Shaking Beef is delicious. The Bun Bo Hue is even better.  I skipped these dishes the first time because I was a little intimidated by the name but, that was my mistake. The Calamari is wonderful here but, you guys need some Marinara sauce to go with it.nnMatt, my server was super thanks Matt but we had a big group so everyone chipped in whenever they could,  thanks Nick and David  The owner, Victor was constantly checking to make sure things were ok, they were but, I LOVED that.nnI was with a diverse group  years old but, everyone had a blast.nnFriendly place, good food, great value.  Try for yourself. then send Me a compliment on yelp.  I need more!!!"
1,"I was on a recent trip to Vegas with friends from all over the West Coast and we culminated our weekend with dinner at Ferraros.  The restaurant is cozy, they have an extensive wine list, and despite the dressed up atmosphere, the vibe is relaxed.  The food was great!  Simple Italian preparation with tons of flavor.  I had the Veal  the meat was juicy and tender, and the sauce was deliciously tangy.  I ordered the Grilled Asparagus as a side, which was perfectly cooked.  Everyone in our table enjoyed their meals as I heard a lot of yumyum noises throughout dinner.  Paolo took care of us and was very helpful with wine suggestions the Chianti he recommended went beautifully with my dish.  At the end of our meal, Paolo surprised us with complimentary dessert!  We each had a tiramisu and canoli  light yet luscious and tasty!  nnThis next part of my review is all about customer service.  Aside from being charming and attentive, Paolo went above and beyond his job description.  He called us two cabs there were  of us to take us to the Luxor after dinner.  One came and turns out, the second one never arrived.  When our friends finally met us later, they told us that Paolo ended up driving them to the Luxor!nnFerraros is definitely a mustvisit every time we are in Vegas!"
1,"I will always make time to go here when Im in Vegas since its the CLOSEST to me! Ohh fresh hot sandwiches so flavorful and so perfectly toasted! The price is amazing too. Totally affordable after youve lost it all in Vegas. The warmth of the sandwiches inside your tummy will make you feel much much better. I want some now that Im thinking about it. Oh, I ordered the signature sandwich as well as the meatball one. Next time I go Im going to try something different having faith that it wont disappoint."
1,"I really enjoy this place! It is not my favorite Mexican restaurant in the valley, but it still has very good food and it is not priced too high. nnThe queso fundido and guacamole are great starters. I have tried a good amount of things on the menu, but my absolute favorite has to be the blue crab enchiladas. It was a risky move ordering them, but it was so worth it. I have been here a few times and each time I have to order them. nnThe margaritas are also worth a try. This is probably my second favorite Mexican restaurant after Barrio Cafe."
1,"When I was little my father would take us to the mom and pop store a few miles away for breakfast items.  On Guam that would be empanadas, turnovers, and these homemade sugar twist donuts still hot from the fryer.  I used to go in my pajamas because I hated dressing up.  Donuts are a favorite of mine, even Winchells when I was growing up.  My father would stop in and we would buy a dozen donuts to share with my classmates or for his workplace. I would always get first pick out of the box and it would usually be the sugar twist.nnFlash forward to , where donuts are on a whole new level and The Pink Box is dishing up some doozies.  I know, fellow readersthese crazy donut concoctions started a few years back and this is old newsbut have you tried Pink Boxs donuts?  The minute you eat one of their amazing creations you seriously gonnI know I did.nnOur first encounter with the Pink Box was a few weeks back while out antiquing with my mother and husband.  I looked up donut shops nearby and this place happened to be on the list.nnnnThe logo is adorable, the donuts listed look sexy, so I figured it would be a great donut adventure.  nnWe parked along the building and noticed a slight line forming to get in the door.  Luckily the line subsided quickly and we entered the tiny shoppe to see a full glass case and racks of donuts behind it.  There were donuts for every tastesalty, sweet, bacon, fresh fruit, and sugar sugar sugar.  I was excited about the nutty donut with bleu cheese and figs, the baconator maple bar, strawberry shortcake, sugar glaze twist, classic red velvet cake, and a chipotle caramel round.nnI never expected bleu cheese with figs on a white glazed donut filled with pasty cream to be so...pornographic...but it is.  The flavors of salty bleu cheese, chewy figs, slivered almonds and that pastry cream just have this crazy flavor orgy.  I then moved on to the baconator barwho doesnt love their pancakes with maple syrup and bacon all in one bite?  The shortcake and twists were fantastic and light, as well as the velvet, but the star of the show was that sexy, gooey, spicy bitchthe chipotle caramel donut.nnnThis is the one that you take home to mother.  This is the donut of all donuts.  It is simple, spicy, and perfect.  That fluffy fried goodness, I imagine, is dipped and waved in that spicy caramel mix for a second or two, then flipped and dripped on a rack.  I love that the chipotle is mixed into the caramel and specks are on the donut.  When you bite in to it, your tongue sings a serenade of love.  My husband and mother asked for a bite, and at first I was like YOU GET NOTHING!  nnThats mean.  nnI gave them a third of the donut each and we all sat in silence, in the car, chewing and mmming at the grandeur of this beautiful, round pastry.  nnThe Pink Box has my heart and my tastebuds whipped.  I will never cheat on her.  I will remain faithful and love her until the end of time.  It is more than the crazy concoctions they create that gets me their donuts bring me back to my childhood, the moments in the car with my father where I pull the twist apart and eat it like cotton candytwo fingers, pulling and prying it apart until its all gone.  Hed smile, and Id smile at how happy my tummy and my heart was.  These donuts bring me back to that feeling and those memories. Thats what great food should do, and the Pink Box delivers."
1,"This place is heaven on earth for non sitdown restaurants. Id go here everyday if it were up to me and if I had enough money. Yeah, thats my only problem with this place I usually get so carried away with ordering food that before I know it Ive burned  on my lonesome self for a filling meal at NOTO, especially with the recent price increases. But whatever, its worth it. For the food quality you get, the prices are reasonable.nnYou really cant go wrong with the menu the worst youll get is adequate. Ive had so much stuff here so Ill just give a comprehensive review of what I likedwhat wasnt incredible.nnStuff I thoroughly recommendnnFried Chicken Wings DONT overlook these some of the best wings Ive hadnnRed Beans and Rice with Double Sausage The double sausage is an absolute MUSTit will turn the dish from good to great. Dont forget hot sauce.nnShrimp Po Boy Theres a reason these things are so popular because theyre freaking tasty. Get one and thank me later.nnOyster Po Boy Perfect balance of flavorful batter and oyster goodness.nnFried Catfish Catfish heaven in Madison, at the very least. Po Boy of this was surprisingly not nearly as impressive.nnSeafood Combo wSweet Potato Fries If youre feeling luxurious, get yourself a medley of savory cod, juicy oysters and fresh shrimp. Go for sweet potato fries the normal ones are average at best.nnShrimp uctouffuee Spicy and probably quite fattening, but a definite flavor bomb in your mouth.nnHot Sauce Sort of a joke, but seriously put hot sauce on anything that makes remote sense. Especially the fried foods.nnStuff I wasnt AS impressed withnnFried Chicken Breast Po Boy Just tasted like a slightly upgraded version of a generic fastfood sandwich. I got it for the relatively low price. But it was still somewhat tasty.nnCatfish Po Boy Surprisingly I thought the Po Boy overpowered the natural tastiness of the catfish. I might have to give this another try, though, because I do love catfish and po boys.nnBBQ Beef Po Boy Probably my least favorite entree on the menu... just tough cubed beef drenched in barbecue sauce on bread. Okay.nnJambalaya Peppery and tasty to an extent, but not as flavorful as I would have hoped.nnRed Rice and Beans wo Sausage A bit overhyped without double sausage, although still good. Hot sauce is a must for these.nnShrimp Creole Good and spicy but not incredible.nnMardi Gras Combo the above  in one dish Actually the  together are a decent balance if youre going to get one of them you might as well get this and get all .nnEverything else Ive tried that doesnt fit into either of those two categoriesnnDebs BBQ Shrimp Great potential, good flavors, but seems a bit onesided in terms of just lemon and butter. I cant really explain it wouldnt recommend it nor discourage it.nnFried Gulf Shrimp Above average if youre a fan of fried shrimp and decent portion but then again its... fried shrimp. Im a bigger fan of the Po Boy.nnDirty Rice Im still trying to figure out what I think of this in comparison with the other dishes. It just seems like rice with salt and cayenne plus trace amounts of other spices that somehow augment the taste a little bit.nnThat turned out a lot longer than it should have but honestly there isnt a single thing that Ive had here that I was disappointed with or for anything that was I disappointed with, it was because I had set the bar so high from previous trips here. Take your pick and Im sure youll enjoy what you get."
1,"I visited Oreganos on a Friday evening for a date with my sweetheart. They were busy but we got seated within  minutes. They gave us a cute little table for two, outside right by a fire.nnThe food, OH MY GOD, was so amazing. We ordered the Oreganos big salad, thin crust number oneo pizza, and a chocolate chip cookie pizza. We throughly enjoyed EVERY bite of our meal. I had the house made italian dressing with my salad. It was a very big salad and was plenty to share.The pizza was very unique and the crust was so delicate. Not your typical pizza from someplace like Pizza Hut. The cookie pizza was TO DIE FOR!!!! I havent stopped thinking about it since out visit. nnThe service was a little slow but it was dinner time on a Friday evening so I cant complain. We enjoyed the fire and romantic atmosphere which made the wait for our food not seem too bad. nnVisit your local Oreganos! It will be your new favorite!"
1,"My employer has requesteddemanded that I not write anything negative about the venues they staff...so you may notice a curious lack of reviews on my part regarding the headliners at Caesars Palace! Like my mom always said, If you cant say anything nice...dont say anything at all! AHEM!!!nnWhen Rod Stewart announced his residency at Caesars, I rolled my eyes Here we go again...another fusty old Baby Boomer relic on the carousel of the damned! You know, that carousel that rotates around Vegas, only instead of horses and giraffes, its full of mummified expop stars who havent had hits in decades?! Tom Jones, Donny  Marie, Gladys Knight, etc. etc. ETC! Enough already!!nnTruthfully, before seeing this show I had always DESPISED Rod Stewart. His cocky bantyrooster shtick always grated on me, and his predilection for leggy blondes onequarter of his age made me wanna barf. What a loser, right?!nnWell, loser or no...his show is AWESOME! Shh...dont tell anyone Im saying this, but Rod Stewart is an AMAZING performer! Unlike OTHER headliners, who recite the same corny jokes night after night and seem to be phoning it in from a safe distance, Rod actually ENGAGES with the audience. While hes singing, instead of just staring into space with boredom disguised as poignancy, he actually makes eye contact with individual members of the crowd, gesturing and winking and smiling at them, sending them into fits of ecstasy. Most of his fan base appears to be Southern cougars with ginormous blonde hairdos, so its a LOT of fun to watch!nnAside from that, Rod also MOVES AROUND THE STAGE. Unlike OTHER headliners who plant their fat asses on a piano bench and proceed to sweat their way through  minutes of oldies, he actually dances around the stage... and the ENTIRE ROOM! I dont want to ruin the surprise for anyone, but be prepared to see Rod up close and personal  even if youre not in the first  rows!nnBut it gets even better. The main thing that sealed the deal for me, and made me a real Rod Stewart fan, is when he sings the song Hot Legs. Not only does he sing this belter LIVE no lipsyncing for Rod  WHILE hes belting it, crew members are tossing out bunches of autographed soccer balls which Rod then proceeds to kick out into the crowd. If youve ever been inside the Colosseum, you know how cavernous that room is. Well, Rod Stewart, at the advanced age of  or however old he is manages to kick some of them into the UPPER BALCONY !!...all while singing belting Hot Legs... AND while engaging with the crowd! It is AMAZING!!!nnRod is also wont to invite random fans onstage WITH HIM !!. Can you imagine OTHER headliners doing that?! Im talking to you, you fakeass Quebecois diva!!! One time, Rod invited everyone in the theater who was wearing a Celtic Football Club jersey onstage to sing with him he made them promise to behave, but tolerated it when one fat old granny grabbed his ass and kissed him on the cheek while he was singing. On other nights, hell let various Southern cougars onstage WHILE HE IS SINGING Maggie May... and whats more, hell let them sit next to him and TAKE PHOTOS with their personal cameras of him  or even of him and themselves together! WHILE HES SINGING HIS BIGGEST HIT! nnI ask you...what other headliner does that shit?! Answer NO ONE!nnAside from how downtoEarth and awesome Rod appears to be, his band is also amazing. He has a smoking hot blonde brass section blondes in mini dresses blowing on saxophones...growwwrrr!, a bunch of hot young mods in skinny ties and Beatle boots playing backup, and a trio of superhot backup singers who really, really rock it.nnIm here to tell you, I DESPISED Rod Stewart  I mean, DESPISED  until I watched this show one night. Even his most overplayed, tired old songs are fun to watch  because his delivery is EXCELLENT. nnBut sssshhhhhh!!!!! Dont tell anyone...or my hipster cred will be shot to hell!"
1,"This venture was definitely worth the  admission price.  Im a dolphin nut, so I rarely pass up the opportunity to see dolphins.  its kind of nice to see them just swimming around and not doing tricks or anything.  I did wish there was more information about the dolphins to read or listen to or something.  Instead there was, of all things, a snack stand, and a gift shop of course.nnThe biggest pull at the time of our trip is that one of their dolphins has given birth.... and theres a baby dolphin!  Ive never seen a baby dolphin so that was awesome... I wish Id gotten a better photo of it than I did, but it was cute.  nnPast the dolphins you enter the original Secret Garden.  They have white lions, which is quite a rare sight, white tigers, regular tigers, some alpacas wtf why? and a leopard.  I understand that behind the chain link fences are dangerous animals, but I wish they had some other type of barrier because the chain link fences were nearly impossible to take pictures through, but I tried.nnOn the way in to the big cat and oddly placed alpaca area, standard Vegas protocol dictates that they have some employees and a photographer hustling your party to pose in front of a green screen to take a photo for sale in the gift shop!.  As a side note, the number of green screen souvenir photo opportunities in Vegas was ASTOUNDING.nnAnd as you leave, of course, you have to exit through the gift shop... and the only exit back into the Mirage walks you right past the dolphin gift shop.nnOverall, it was worth it for me and my friend.  And the kids that were everywhere were having what looked like fantastic times so Id recommend it for families but, I wouldnt really go there again.  One trip is enough."
1,"Too bad I cant bring my dog along very cool trail. Good workout, lots of people, lots of parking, very central location super easy to get to. nBring lots of water, and bring your camera or some great shots."
1,"This place is not bad, at least it is way better than Federicos and to a certain extent filibertos. The chorizo burrito is great just has a little too much tortilla for the amount of filling you get. The chile relleno plate was also pretty good, you get one more chile relleno than I am used to getting in texas. The only problem was that the plate was covered in lettus, so much lettus I had a hard time finding the chiles. I was also not happy with the prices, a little high for a fast food mexican place, it might just be the Arizona economy changed since the  years Ive been gone. Other than that, its a pretty good little mexican place plus its only half a mile from my home so I got that going for me."
1,"As good as the AYCE sushi offerings in Wausau at half the price  and you serve yourself!nnI have eaten at several AYCE sushi bars, and this one is definitely in my top  simply just for the value. Sashimi and nigiri sushi included in the bar, and it costs   not including your drink. Plus they have so much hot seafood that I wish I could eat... but being allergic to some of it, I have to stay away unfortunately nnAll of this on top of the fact that there was squid salad... the same stuff you have to pay  for a small plate of at a normal sushi bar... and its all you can eat."
1,I have owned a C taser since  and a month ago I tested it without the wired which I do periodically it stopped working. I emailed with customer service and called them when I couldnt find my serial number for the form to send in the device. The customer service was so helpful and located my serial number and they assured me I could send it in even though it is not under warranty no problem.  A week or so after sending my taser in FedEx knocked on my door and delivered a brand new replacement taser. I am beyond happy with this company and the way they back up their products. Thank you so much Taser international...  I love my C and I am so happy to feel safe again with this new one!!!
1,"I came by today to get a few photos to post on Yelp.  A voice sounding much like Mistis said, Well youve come this far.  You might as well have something so you can review the place, too! nnI know, its a heck of a job, but someones got to do it.  I forced myself to enter the restaurant, perused the menu for quite awhile, and then decided to try the Hazelnut Cream Chocolate Milkshake made with vanilla bourbon ice cream, dark chocolate truffle, and topped with whipped cream.nnIt was served in an Alice mug that says, Drink Me, a signature mug of the bald man.  It comes from a statement in Alice in Wonderland when she found a little bottle with a paper label that said, Drink me.nnThe milkshake was outstanding if a bit pricey  ..  The restaurant is quite nice, and the employees were just excellent  smiles all around and very helpful.  I also bought a tin of caramelized pecans rolled in praline cream and cocoa powder for later nourishment.  Take one as needed.nnI want to come back when I have a late lunchearly dinner and try some of the food offerings.  Its quite a nice place."
1,"This is a great place for the view, the romantic ambiance, and the service.  The food, unfortunately, is hitormiss  especially considering the price.nnWe had a reservation at  on a busy night.  Fortunately, the dining rush was dying down by then and we were quickly seated by a corner table tables on the northeast side will get you a better view of the Pittsburgh skyline.  The waiters were friendly and courteous, and the manager came out to deliver our wine selection.  True to the restaurants name, the menu featured a copious selection of fish.  Im pretty sure that being at the top of a tall building on top of a hill overlooking a city is the opposite of being a grotto, though.nnWe started with a sampler of various appetizers that included shrimp, crab cakes, and a fish skewer.  These all had great flavor and texture and paired well with their respective sauces.nnI had the whole bronzini classically prepared with tomatoes, onions, capers, and olives.  The kitchen delivered a solid performance on this one  crispy skin with tender flesh and a good balance of flavors.  I managed to sneak a few bites of my dates lemon sole, which was unfortunately overdone and in want of a sauce.  If you dont mind eating whole fish, thats what I would recommend  its much harder to screw up the preparation.nnWe shared the chai tea cake for dessert, which was also perfectly acceptable.  There were many interesting choices available, though, and we had a hard time deciding.nnMoral of the story  this is a great place for a fancier date or night out, but dont expect amazing food.  Oh, and the wine list is fairly extensive and expensive, even by fancy restaurant markup standards."
1,"I bring my family and friends here at least every other week. Every single time we are here we get smiles from the folks who run the joint, nothing but good vibes and great service. The wait is average, about  minutes but by golly it is totally worth it. The food is fantastic every single time. Ive not had something off of the menu I dont like. I must warn you, the French Toast is beyond heavenly and one bite will cause you to run back here every weekend, guaranteed!  The new pastries are phenominal and you can tell they are baked with love, not packaged. Ugh, cant say enough great stuff!"
1,"The specials of Burrito Drive are you guessed it burritos! They serve up some interesting variations on this Mexican staple, my favorite being the Shemehneh burrito. This combination of chicken, bacon, sweet potato filling, rice, cheese, and onions fulfill the sweet, savory, and umami flavors that make me crave food from here more often than I like to admit.nnThey have good tasting meat here, which is something I consider very important while grading any restaurant. Its succulent and charred meat has been much more of a hit than a miss for the many times Ive ordered from here. nnThis is one of my main gotos for delicious and unique food in Madison."
1,"Love this place... Highly recommend. Bummer that they are closed on Tuesdays as thats when I seem to crave it the most. Lol.  Always taste fresh. Staff is friendly.  Love the small local feel.  The Pho is delicious every time. I love the P which has brisket as steak while my girlfriend love the Pseafood Pho.  They do get pretty busy during peak times, but trust me it is worth the wait.  I never knew soup could pack such a flavorful punch."
1,"Half my friends and nearly the entire hospital being Filipino its obvious how much of the culture I have absorbed and appreciated.  Filipino food being the main aspect with all their fried, greasy deliciousness! nnIn my area I only had Fiesta Filipina which was overly greasy maybe thats why they put it right in front of the hospital lol. Also, the service here was always stand offish and the setting similar to that of panda express. Luckily I stumbled upon this hidden gem going to Smiths for groceries.nnInterior Walking in it was pretty quiet and only a family enjoying a quiet dinner.  The restaurant is nicely lit and fairly big.  There is a whiteboard by the register with daily specials. nnService I was greeted by the owner who was very friendly, thoroughly explained the entire menu and gave me pretty enticing food recommendations which will be explored in the future.nnFood I ordered the palabok which was only  bucks and came on a pretty big platter with crispy garnish of pork rinds with eggs and onions all neatly decorated.nnOverall I love this place.  Its chill, bomb food, extremely affordable with great portions."
1,"The perfect burger?Yes. The perfect toppings? Yes. The perfect place to hang with friends or your significant other? Most definitely. Service.... ok. Its ok. I mean the bigger the group the bigger tip so maybe thats it, but the smaller the group is still  if the service is good. nnI go here every year and its always multiple times when Im here and its always great. The burgers are always cooked to perfection and the quality for the cost is awesome. nnI cant say enough good things about this place, with adult shakes and delicious appetizers why not go back?!nnFood, A Service B Atmosphere AnnEnjoy!"
1,"this is my go to cleaners in the east valley they do a fantastic job. Ive been going here for years. you can even bring them back the hangers, and theyll reuse them! totally a green cleaner like the name implies. My only complaint is that one time out of ,,,,, they misplaced my clothes. the problem was that there is another person with my same last name in the system, a female. Im a guy. they tried to hand me a dress. um....no. not even on Halloween do i play that way. at first, they thought i was joking. OK, i get that. my followers know Im a funny little dude. i told them what i thought happened which is exactly what happened and they said theyll look into it. the next day, they found my stuff about  items all dress shirts and dress pants. how the women with the same last name grabs this instead of her  DRESS i have no clue. if i could review her, she would receive a negative  stars. rep the name genius. HERESS my grief with the Cleaners no discount for the situation. Im not a cheap person, however i am in the cst service industry. and i know if you, as a service provider, screw the pooch especially in an over crowed market like dry cleaning where theyre next to every Starbucks, massage parlor and Walgreens around, you offer something more than an Im Sorry. this one time, and its the only time anything bad has ever happened here, is the reason for the .  off? come on man. were talking . Im in weekly. you know my name by heart. lets get real."
1,"The customer service is alright  of the time. One time when my friends and I stopped for some rat food, I saw ferrets eating what looked like their own feces in their water bowls and a rat that looked deathly ill. When I confronted the manager about it she instantly took an attitude with me and was super nasty. I had to actually take a step back and say, Wow! Hey lady, im just concerned and asking. She never fully recovered from being completely rude... I guess she thought I was a ft tall PETA member on a mission or something. Still, the next time I went ive never seen sick rats or baby ferrets eating slop again. The other time I was with my husband and I could not find a single Petsmart rep to help me find something for my cat. We ended up giving up and luckily found something at Walmart in the same plaza.nOther than those  instances, we generally just go for catdog food. Get the food, checkout, done. nThe checkout is always pleasant. haha except when the person behind you is literally inches away from you... must be a Vegas thing. Happens everywhere we shop. No personal space unless you force it lol"
1,"I have been dining here for  years, and I hope its around for  more.  nTheres nothing fancy about Goldon Wok, its a simple chinese restaurant in a strip mall. The food is good, especially their egg rolls. The prices are reasonable, and the owners are very friendly. We often celebrate birthdays here with the extended family, and they are very accomodating for our large parties. Well bring in a cake for dessert and they are happy to provide us with additional plates and silverware at no charge."
1,"I come here a lot for chinese food. The owner is very friendly and will provide any suggestions, but everything on their menus is good! And the prices are very decent. nnIve tried majority of the menu, but I find myself almost always ordering the same thing these days, which is the deep fried chicken over rice. I havent had anything bad to date. nnI will get the Shrimp Won Tons, sauteed veggies Thai style, deep friend chicken over rice, and sweetened roti pancakes, but take most of it home. nnI like their almond and mango pudding, but the mango is really sweet compared to their almond, which is expected, but be warned if you cant handle super sweet, stay away from the mango and go with the almond! The Sweetened Roti pancake is another good choice! Its only  while the pudding are . each. nnBasically would recommend anything and everything on the menu! As the prices are pretty cheap too, dont be afraid to make this a regular spot!"
1,"Great place for kids and families, or to watch a sporting event.  Parking is an issue.  Be prepared to valet free if you get there at lunch time or after pm.  Food is reliable and tasty.  Actually getting your food can take awhile, so order promptly."
1,"I had a hard time deciding how to rate this not because of indifference on my part, but rather with respect to what to expect. So lets just start with, if youre looking for the fullon Korean experience with dozens of bowls around you and formal, even surly, sullen service, this is not the place. But if you want some excellent food in a relaxed environment, you wont be disappointed.nnThe name says it all this is Korean and Hawaiian and, coming up, ChineseKorean with island style. The owner or the husband of the owner couple just oozes chill its practically relaxing just talking to him. And hell hang out and chat. Even call you brah. The service overall is personal, informal, and pleasant.nnThis is a tiny place its in a strip mall, and youd be forgiven for not finding it right away. You have to look hard and hope that youre not being pressed by busy Sahara traffic.nnI was on my own, in town for CES. When seated, he first gave me a bowl of boiled peanuts to nosh on. Then came the banchan trio kim chi, kaktugi Korean radish kim chi, and bean sprouts. Im reasonably familiar with kim chi I make my own occasionally this was good, although not particularly sour or complex. The kaktugi was great. He then brought out a separate bowl of this radishgreen kim chi. This was absolutely excellent spicy and sharp with a hint of sweet.nnI went with the spicy squid really good. Not super spicy, but then again, I have a high threshold.nnCost around  for everything. Really. In contrast to many Korean places. And I left totally full.nnApparently they have just installed three highintensity burners they had just been inspected and approved that day, and they plan to do Chinesestyle food too, like black noodles. They will also handmake their own noodles.nnPity I dont live here it would become a regular place for me. Clearly they have other regulars one couple came in and the waiter asked if they wanted him to clean their regular table so they could sit there instead of somewhere new. Nice local indie place thats where I like to spend my money when traveling, and Ill be back here at some point."
1,Typical BJs. Came to watch the cardinals game. nBoyfriend loves their BBQ chicken deep dish pizza. We got the chicken wontons thai style. They were ok. Not great but not bad. nFood is typical but they do do a great job with service.
1,"its a nice bowling center the lanes are nice.  The people that are here, are here to have fun.  It is good for large groups and weekly events. Beers are little high but then again you are at Red Rock."
1,The original wvfn meetup spot! Great spot just off the  for cold brew! Bring  friends and order Irish Car Bombs! They have a great slapper for the experience. Still waiting for the video hint clintus
1,"The wife and I are always on a quest to find something different to eat, and we decided we would give Mimis a try.nnThe first impression felt like I walked into a beautiful home, it had a nice and comfortable decor and for it being a Saturday afternoon wasnt that busy. We waited about  minutes before being seated which was really nice.nnAt first glance of the menu I was alittle overwhelmed there was so much to look at and since I dont speak French I had a hard time deciding what was what being that most of the dishes have French names and not all of em have pictures but thankfully the waitress we had was very friendly and answered all our questionsnnMy wife had the bouillabaisse and I had the quiche Lorraine both were first times trying these dishes and we were both absolutely stunned at how delicious it was!! The bread they give was scrumptious and the muffins were heavenly!! nnI cant wait to come back here again!"
1,"So I have a lot of hobbies, and these hobbies involve alot of stuff, that ended up in my garage. After my mom threatened to throw all my stuff out I decided it was time to rent a storage place. Im very glad I chose this place, not only is it on the way to work, and very close to my house, the customer service girl, San, is amazing! D I felt like I made a new friend, both girls were very friendly, polite, and helpful."
1,Kobe Sushi is a great place to visit for some quality Vegas sushi.  The decor is great for a casual or business dinner and the overall sushi quality is great.   off special for being in business for  years on most of their rolls.  Also they offer Allyoucan eat for the  standard in town.  Many inventive chief specials to create a refreshing twist to the menu.
1,"For those familiar know its a chain restaurants the great part is it doesnt have that cookie cutter feeling of mediocrity from most other chain establishments. This is the second Carrabbas I have been to nand have to say you get the feeling you r patronage counts. This is what usually separates smaller owner operated establishment . nnAs from atmosphere its warm and comfortable, the the staff are accommodating . nnAs usual I take my position at of near the bar, get a feel of the area especially when in a new city.The bartender was both knowledgeable and helpful with the menu and local questions , including local brews. nnOver all food price and portion size more than win , and should be a lesson to other chain restaurants that a good night out and good service are far better advertising that corny ads and jingles on TV and radio"
1,"I have yet to buy anything here, but the owner graciously gave me a great rundown on a bunch of different suppressors  including a line that Id been VERY interested in, but had not had a chance to see in person. nNote that right now, at least, they are NOT accepting cards. This is probably temporary I didnt ask, but dont show up to buy something with only plastic without calling and checking first."
1,"We went here for my friends th birthday her choice and had an amazing time. I dont even like country music and this was still the highlight night of our trip. There was a live band and they also played Top  hits in between sets. Our bartender, James, was freakin fabulous. He made us sweet but strong shots all night long. The only downside was the  hour recovery period, but that was likely my fault  Cant speak to their food, but their bartenders, music and patrons made for a great night."
1,"My boyfriend and I have started eating here every Sunday Divine Eatery deserves nothing less than  stars!nnSo far we have ordered the eggs benedict, garlic fries, turkey wrap, and patty melt... all delicious. nYou can tell everything is fresh, and the flavors are incredible. nnThe atmosphere is great as well. I love the decor, the colors of the wall paint, and the cute wooden seats. Very at home feeling.nnThis restaurant also get  stars for customer service. Our food always comes out in a timely manner, and our waitress is always incredibly kind and attentive to us."
1,I tried out smashburger for the first time tonight and it was pretty tasty. I got the chicken avocado club with no bacon and my wife got the smashburger regular size. We also got a side of fries. The chicken was really tender and moist and the flavoring was really good. My wife said that the burger was really yummy too. The fries were really good also. Shoestring fries and cooked perfectly. I also thought that it had a nice setup and was a pleasant dining in experience. Would definitely go again in the future.
1,"This place is a cute little Mexican Restaurant in Old Town. I use to come here a lot when I worked in the area, but havent been back for a while since I moved. We visited this place last Monday night and I have to say its as I remember it. The staff is very friendly and quick the atmosphere gives off an old, rustic Mexican village vibe and the food isnt too shabby. The best thing about this place is their meal portions. Anything you get here is huge! You definitely have to take home left overs because there is just so much. This last visit I enjoyed the nachos, all by myself getting my food baby on and I took home half my platter. Of course in this case these nachos come out pilled with meat, beans, cheese, jalapeufos..... on a pizza pan! Holy nachos!!! I feel the meat could have had a little better flavoring but the abundance of cheese was perfect! I love cheese on my nachos! My friend ordered their enchilada plate, along with that he got rice and beans. The enchilada was nice and spicy and the refried beans were pretty tasty. Im not a huge fan of rice, so in my book it was ok, a little dry.... But ok. The food didnt blow me away, but it hit the spot!"
1,"Living in Tucson I wanted to have dinner with my Dad, he lives in Tempe, for his birthday. My Parents found Tommys via google, menu looked good so we made a reservation. This is the perfect halfway point between Tucson and Phoenix. Arriving at our table we found it covered with a white linen and some balloons accompanying it. The other tables were without this so it was a nice touch. The server was nice but not very quick on her feet, she seemed to be a new hire. Seems like a pretty straightforward menu, I played it safe and went with the Chicken Parmesan and it was tasty. I chose a side of Penne with Alfredo and that too was good. The sauces tasted fresh, not from a jar and the cheese was perfectly baked on top. The ravioli and chicken Florentine were also ordered and well received. The bread was good, standard Baguette that was sliced and served with butter. My dad got a slice of cheesecake for his Bday. It was good but small so we ordered another to split between the  of us. The restaurant has a sign claiming to be the best in Casa Grande, which may very well be true. But the restaurant seemingly has an identity crisis. The Prices for entrees ran   which lends to a higher end restaurant yet there were many things that screamed Family Diner. The bread was served with butter packets like iHop. A nice house made herbed butter would be a good touch. Tommys has an unique homely feel, since it is a converted houses but the tables and chairs are diner styled and the uniforms seem to be whatever the server feels like. Overall it was good food and quite environment but a little more thought into decorating and how to incorporate the homey feel would give it great character and charm. Making it feel more like a high end restaurant and less like a family diner."
1,"I also love this Harris Teeter. Its small, but the salad bar is fresh and exciting, and their soupdelibistro selection is topknotch. Its a great way to break up the lunch routine, and it reminds me of grocery shopping in New York City with the little grocery stores and the parking deck. The staff is friendly and helpful, and its always been a clean, quick, pleasant experience for me in this store. Like all the Harry Peters, its a little overpriced,but you do get what you pay for in many ways."
1,"Wow! This was our first time eating here  we loved it! Everything was great, the service but even better was the food. A must have is the Bacon Wrapped Dates  for sure the Paella Valenciana. The shrimp in the paella was perfectly cooked. Chef Oscar Sanchez even came around to greet the patrons. A job well done"
1,"We have stacationed most of the hotels in las vegas. we have stayed in beautiful hotels in california. the standard room here is the most beautiful room i have ever stayed in  sunken livingroom with supersized sectional plus floor to ceiling windows plus xerox and fax machine, desk, table with  chairs and even a decent selection of television stations. new card sign up gets  dollars free play and a t shirt. when my slot machine got stuck the attendent credited me another  in free play too. we will be back!!!!"
1,"First off, I must say that the waiters and staff were freaken awesome. Our waiter was super cool and friendly. I liked how with every dish that came out, our waiter would explain what was in it.nnI would recommend sticking with the sushi. Hubby and I got the Tenderloin of Beef Toban Yaki along with our sushi, and for something to be like  I would expect it to me amazing, but the dish was alright. nnGET THE BENTO BOX for dessert. You can thank me later."
1,"Best pastries ever! And i m really picky when it s about croissant!  i love the freshness of the products , best croissant of montreal. Other products are also very good. A nice retro atmosphere in every bakery, it took me sometimes to finally find THE good bakery, i love it and recommend !"
1,"A local friend introduced me to this jewel restaurant where his son manages.  An amazing  little place with so much originality.  We started with a Thai influenced pumpkin purueed soup with a fried fish cake in the center.  I had two  yummy appetizers for dinner.  The  uni dish reminded me of Paris, while the tacos with home made soft tortillas reminded me of LA.  The place was packed and bustling, yet we had excellent service.  I will  definitely be back soon."
1,"The BEST sushi in Phoenix! Theyre not trying to be arrogant, they just serve quality food.  They have a wonderful selection of the most fresh fish!  I also love that its BYOB.  So they focus  on the food.  And they have a great selection of none sushi items to cover everyones palate.  Plus the service is phenomenal!  My personal fav is the Rainbow Carpaccio!"
1,"My first visit at My Big Fat Greek Restaurant was mostly a pleasant one.nnFor starters my fiance and I both loved the appetizers. The bruschetta was some of the best I have had, because personally I love the soft bread they use. I dont like the crunchy hard bruschetta bread that other places use. Here the bread is soft and delicious. We also had the calamari and were pleased with it.nnWe ordered the gyro platter and were mostly happy with it, but we didnt like that they hardly give you any pieces of pita bread. We didnt mention it, but the waitress ended up asking if we wanted more pita bread anyways. We said yes and ended up getting charged an extra dollar, which I wish they would have mentioned because I assumed when she asked that it was complimentary to go along with the dish.nnAside from that the service was pretty good. They served refills in pitchers which was interesting. The only food item I didnt like was the potatoes which came as a side to the gyro platter. They had a weird taste. We both enjoyed the desserts here though. The bill was also a bit more than what we had expected, but on the whole we were pleased with this restaurant mainly because of the excellent appetizers!"
1,"This is an Aplus library.  Once I discovered it and hit my daughter up for her library card I started coming in here  times a week, checking out audio books and DVDs mostly.  I cant tell you how many books I read and movies I saw thanks to them but it was a lot in the nine months I was in Chandler.  I even checked out CDs and burned them at home so I could listen to them while I tooled around town.nnThe librarians saw me so much they started calling me by namemy daughters name that is.  I told her, if you ever go in there they wont believe you are you because they associate that name with me.  if Id known I was going to be there for so long I would have gone ahead and gotten my own card using a piece of mail with my name and Chandler addressif they didnt care about the Calif drivers license that is.  I guess I never took that chance.nnAnother plus is the wonderful little gift shop and snack cafe on the lower floor where they had not only smoothies and coffee but fudge they make on the premises, fresh chilled fruits, and the best chicken salad on croissant sandwiches youve ever tastedalso made from their own recipe on the spot.  There were also turkey and ham sandwiches but I only got the chicken salad it was so good.  Even if I wasnt hungry I would buy one and refrigerate it at home to eat for dinner or lunch the next day.nnSo I developed my rounds in Chandlergo to the PO to mail my eBay packages, the library to turn in movies and books and get new, the rubber stamp store and delis nearbymy own little piece of heaven."
1,"stars because the staff are always helpful and willing to help.  star left off due to lack of oneplusone monitoring. The Lead always seems to walk around fast talking on their radio, but no additional registers opened."
1,"Gorgeous, gorgeous ballpark. If you are a baseball fan, I dont care where you live, get your arse to PNC Park. nnEverything about this park, except for the team no offense, Bucs fans, is top notch. The park itself has a very cozy feel to it and offers a great view of the city. The food is excellent and theres a ton of variety. You can get really great seats for an affordable price. Plus, I dont know if you nonPittsburgh residents such as myself know this, but Pittsburgh is actually a pretty clean city and a lot of fun.nnI think I might like this better than Camden Yards, actually. Definitely a mustsee for any baseball fan."
1,"What a fun little shop!  I came here with the kiddos that I babysat this summer after a visit to a museum.  They had a blast, even as preteens.  They loved all the oldschool toys.  They got a kick out of the puppets and enjoyed the books.  The real winner of the day was a pack of prank shock gum.  They tried to shock me all day after this.  It was a very nice way to break up our day after a more serious museum visit."
1,"Jimmy Buffett in Vegas..not the same as being in the Bahamas or the Caribbean but if it prolongs summer Im in. Jimmy Buffett visits once a year to the MGM in Vegas and I decided to attend the October show.nnI think all the seats are great for visual and the acoustics were good to very good. The seats are comfortable enough and I  did not get a sore back or rear from sitting too long. Most of the crowd was standing and dancing anyways so it was ok.nnIn and out of the arena was bearable, fairly organized and not the typical crowd stampede. Drinks and food were marked up accordingly. nnWorth seeing a venue at."
1,"This place was awesome! I never knew a sandwich could be made so big until I came here. Carnegie was a little bit pricey but you get a ton of meat and many people take the extra meat home and make a sandwich for later. My boyfriend and I came back to this place to taste their cheesecake which was good nothing to special besides the once again big portion. Overall, I really liked this place. The one bad thing about this was the service was slow both times we were there otherwise I would definitely try it out!"
1,"Spontaneously deciding to eat here on a business trip turned out FANTASTIC. The resort this place is in, is very beautiful the service from when you drive up in the lobby, and thru to the restaurant is welcoming. nThe bar makes balanced delicious drinks like the Ultimate Margarita,  a must try  If you love a steak sandwich....  the French Dip Sandwich will make your mouth water! nThe view of the golf course is relaxing  the service was timely. nI would definitely return   recommend to others."
1,"This is a good place to stop if youre looking for a trendy bar  restaurant in Madison. The martini list is nice  the Hug with fresh mango, orange juice and plenty of rum was my favorite. I did notice that the accoustics in Crave werent very good, so be prepared to say What? and Excuse Me? a LOT if the restaurant is busy! Foodwise, my portabella sandwich was very good, with lots of fresh ingredients... but the sweet potato fries were only soso. Ill probably be back  just after pm next time, when they offer halfpriced martinis."
1,"Took my Papillon, Armani, here to get groomed  the people are incredibly friendly, Armani looks great, and the price was great! I would definitely recommend them and will be taking my dog back there repeatedly!"
1,"I have no idea how many times I have eaten here. I think that there is an imprint of my bum on my booth  away from the kitchen door. I always start with the arugula salad, then either the veggie plate or the spit fire turkey sandwich best sami in town, butter beans, and the coconut cake. OMG the coconut cake has a creamy vanilla englaise they drench over it. It is so good. About the butter beans. This is a big thing for me. If youve never had them you need to try them. They are amazing and so good for you. This is something Roosters does so well. If you have a vegetarian in the family you need to come here. Roasted beets, carrots, corn, whatever is in season. Then there are the meatetarians. They will be happy too because Roosters butchers their meat in house weekly. Basically, if I have a group of people with different tastes I need to please I come to Roosters. Everyone will be well fed at a reasonable price, and leave very happy."
1,"I have LOVED Freddys since we took a family vacation to Schlitterbaun water park in Texas and stumbled in one.  At that point we were exhausted and starving from being at the water park and Freddys was AWESOME food.nnOne day I thought hey, I wonder if they have any Freddys out West and found the one on Bell Road.  We loaded up the SUV and drove from Gilbert to Glendale AND the drive was worth it!  We once again LOVED our meal at Freddys!nnWe ended up driving to Glendale about once a month to eat at Freddys, begging them to open a location out in the East Valley  FINALLY it opened  just as we moved to SoCal  nnWhen ever we get back to Arizona we ALWAYS eat at Freddys.  Why?nnThe burgers are steak burgers, high quality meat with seasoning.  The fries are seasoned just right...addicting!  They have free drink refills and the place is old school looking.  THE REAL KICKER...the frozen custard!  WOW, I love their frozen custard creations!nnThey have other menu items, but the steak burger is just fine for me!"
1,"Since moving to Leith I have been in need of a place to meet my Sunday hangover munching requirements.nnKings Wark has solidly taken up the mantel, you know its going to be worthwhile when you walk in at pm and they are still only serving breaky!nnMe and my fellow hangoveree took refuge at a corner table and nursed our fresh orange while perusing the menu!! My first thought was fry up but after reading the menu I was lead to the french roast withy bacon and syrup.nnNow all I can say it that it delivered, I mean its french toast so your are fairly limited with where you can go with it but it ticket all the boxes. For me that means plenty of everything, I hate a syrup scrooge!!!nnLooking at the menu it pretty much covers all the bases if I was going to have a moan Ild say i would like to see eggs benedict on there but thats just cause its my favourite!!nnIn an oober hungover state we were also delighted to see a large free portion of toast and butter brought to us while we waited!!nnAll in all great! Jd  happy man!"
1,Great fast food BBQ as i think of it. Nice sweet sauce and moist pulled pork.   Ribs meat feel right off the bones and wasnt too fatty. Didnt care for the coleslaw but I feel coleslaw is such a personal thing I wouldnt say it was bad. Just not my style. Very House of Cards local BBQ.
1,"Im torn on how to review Hannys. One one hand, the food is just average. nOn the other hand, everything else is greatnI love love love that its in an old department store. nThe bathrooms are cool.nGood selection of vintagetype cocktails.nExcellent cool decor.nDowntown location  please let Hannys be a sign of things to come in downtown P town!nPrices are decent.nSeriously, Hannys, if you upped your food just a little, I easily give you five stars."
1,"Ive been here a coupla timesand they have aMAZING gelato!! Obviously, as the name implies, there are  different flavors to choose from, which they switch out. There are  different sizes small, med which you can mix up to  flavors and large can mix and at about  for  of us, it adds up, but its oh so worth it!nnWe tried chocolate  banana its considered one flavor and the banana flavoring was spot onnot like some places where it tastes like imitation!nnStrawberry cheesecakeit actually had the graham cracker crumbles in it, and swirls of strawberry,  yummy!nngrasshopper I didnt actually try this oneIm not a fan of mint  chocolate, but according to a yr old, it was deliciousnnvanillamud pie two different flavors the vanilla actually tasted like vanilla bean  I didnt try the mud pie but its basically coffee and chocolatennthey have some interesting flavors too like chocolate chili which is literally chocolate with red chiliits absolutely disgusting because just as youre enjoying the chocolate flavor, you get a kick in the tastebuds with the spicy chili they claim people get it though!! nnWe cant wait until the next time we come backtheres so many yummy sounding choices to choose from!! Oh, I sampled the seasonal pumpkin one and it tasted JUST like pumpkin pie!!"
1,"OMG...yummy yogurt!  We were actually trying to find the Sheridans Frozen Custard Yogurt and passed by USwirl.  It definitely caught my eye but we went to Sheridans anyway You can also check out my review.  We decided to share something small so we could still check out USwirl CLam, you are going to LOVE this place!  Esp their logo!. nnLots and Lots of choices!  I wish I could remember it all but yes,  flavors.  First you pick you cup size  sizes, I think and you swirl your own yogurt!!!  I mixed the mango tart, strawberry, and cheesecake yogurt!  They have a variety of toppings fruits, nuts, candy, sprinkles, mochi balls, chocolate syrup, etc and whipped cream!  I went for the blueberry, raspberry, and mango.  After youre done, you just weigh and pay.  Its  cents per oz!  Careful if you bring kids because they can go crazy and pile up a lot of sugar!  Hey, but it is fun to do!!! They also have water and soda from a soda fountain for under a dollar.nnUSwirl recently opened up and is the only one around at the moment.  I guess I would drive the distance for something very good.  Great atmosphere when you walk in.  Some lounge seats and other tables and chairs around.  There is outdoor seating too but it was way too hot.  Lots of parking.  Across the street from Trader Joes and KMart."
1,"Im a big believer in delineating between lifes wants and needs. nAnd thats why I regularly visit the Thumb. SImply put, it has all my needs.nFor examplennI dont want gas for my truck, I need gas for my truck. nnEating bbq doesnt qualify as a want, but it is a need.nnMy truck runs just as efficiently dirty as it does clean. nBut I did hit a bird and squashed a couple of rabbits last month, so a wash and detail is kind of a need at the moment.nnA savage blowjob is also a need, I think. Or maybe its a want, who knows. nIm not sure. nAnyway, they dont feature blowjobs here, leastways, Im pretty certain of it.nnOk, fine. nMaybe The Thumb doesnt have ALL my needs, but it does have most stuff and, at fair prices.nnI recommend the brisket.nAlso, the fullservice wash.nEnjoy the patio seating for lunch, especially this time of year so you can lust after all the cool RVs next door at the storage facility.nId like to steal a real nice one.nMaybe go running around Scottsdale showing off in my new ride with some hot little knobgobbler who also needs to eat bbq."
1,"We stopped in here after our massage at Massage Pro to wait for our taxi. It was dark and gloomy and homey and local and I loved this bar. nnIt was pretty empty since it was only  but hey Beer O Clock. nnThey had video poker built into the bar top and the bartender said if we put a few bucks in the machine shed give us our beer for free. They had Moose Drool on tap and I like to gamble so Im pretty happy. nnI dont no rally play Double Bonus Poker so the bartender came around to explain it to me. I was only playing nickles and having a good day. The only other customer besides us starting talking and was telling us that low stakes isnt worth his time and that we should be playing dollars but we continued on. We told the bartender about the massage place we found on Yelp and she had no idea it was there even though she could see it from her bar. I showed her Yelp on my phone and as we were talking I hit the jackpot on the video slot , nickels  bucks. I did the right thing and gave her her cut roughly  before I left. Even without the win, I like this bar. Ill be back."
1,"Shocked how good t and t is. Its the perfect hybrid of a San Diego  San Francisco taqueria, and a  star fine dining Mexican restaurant.nnThe chips are freshly deep fries tortillas, the salsas are flavorful and fresh, and the drinks are top notch.nnThe entrees shine. We got the  tacos in Vegas and they blew away our picky standards. Were from sf and gf is Latin. the bacon does indeed at a bit too much intensity, but its thick cut and basically just adds the salt component. The carne is rich with the cheese and onions. nnSo freaking good. Vegas food is blowing me away."
1,"After a couple of visits to the Hard Rock, I now know which rooms are the ones to stay in poolfacing and HRH and will keep that in mind to get the most out of future experiences. The Hard Rock is a really great hotel with good restaurants and shops, a great room service menu, and several nice pools. The rooms are spacious and nicely decorated total rock n roll theme with contemporary bathrooms, but not as noiseblocking as some other Vegas hotels. We dont gamble, so the small casino isnt a big deal to us. The prices are super reasonable and more than make up for the distance from the strip. They do have a shuttle that goes there but it ends at , I believe, making it more or less pointless. I also like that its smaller than a lot of the strip hotels, so you dont feel like youre trekking across the country just trying to get to your room. Ill definitely be back."
1,"stars, but Im feeling friendly because it was a nice experience. The   total rating is incredibly accurate. nnHad a really nice dinner here. The service was solid, view was beautiful, and while the food wasnt memorable, it was really good. nnPROS As most say, the view of the LV Valley. They have a nice deck where you can go out and lounge and take in the view. nnThe service was nice and efficient.nnEverything tasted good, but nothing rocked my socks so much I would have to come back for it. My husband really enjoyed his ribeye, and hes hard to please. So you get a whole star added to your rating for that. nTruffle Mac and cheese was also tasty.nnThere is a  discount if you show your Penn  Teller tickets.. Which youll need because...nnCONS its much too pricey for the quality! This is fine dining prices but Outback Steakhouse quality dishes. Yes, its plated nicely and yes the restaurant is pretty, but youre not going to get a unique flavor explosion here. Its good, just nothing to write home about. nnThe Witch Doctor is a giant and cool looking drink but its ! Buyer beware. The price is not on the menu... That should have been our first clue. nnMy  salad I could have thrown together at home. It was mediocre tomatoes, bitter lettuce, crumbled soggy burrata, and a light drizzle of balsamic. Ehh. If youre a fine steakhouse, please use high quality produce, cheese, and balsamic. nnThe bread had potential but was rock hard. nnOverall, a nice meal, a nice view, and other than my empty wallet, nothing substantial to complain about not look forward to for next time."
1,"Greeted nicely by all employees at the range. Overall a great place. If I could make a critique, I would only have . A local resident price would bring me here more often. Typically Im only here during the week for  mins and Im out.  bucks is a little steep for just a quick session after work. Membership options would be nice. A plus is you can use your own ammo, your not stuck using range junk ammo."
1,"HUGE park!  Best place to practice all your sports from running, basketball, volleyball, tennis, soccer, football, softball, baseball, and even have your bootcamp classes here.nnThey have courts for all of the sports above and wide open spaces to set up your own court.  It is a dog friendly park and there is actually a lot of shade.  They have restrooms when nature calls and when it gets dark at night, the lights come on over the court and field areas.nnIve seen many groups come out here to BBQ, practice, and play all kinds of sports.  You will never see this park empty.nnLacks the th star due to my only issue lots of potholes in the grassy areas.  This has caused some of my teammates on my soccer team some injuries from running into them.  These need to get fixed ASAP!."
1,"We came here in a group of  for our traditional team dinner after this years Punk Rock Bowling tournament. We have always tried different places each year but I think we may have found our goto place! The staff and owner were so welcoming and friendly, the food was beyond delicious and the portions were huge. There wasnt one item out of the twenty or so that we ordered!!! that was subpar. Highlights would be the fried eggplant, sesame chicken, hot and sour soup and stirfried potato sticks. I only wish I lived in Vegas so I could come back sooner."
1,"We have been to Way  times now.   times we have done the Teppanyaki and  times we just went for sushi.  The food is good, and they have amazing happy hour and lunch specials for sushi and drinks. When we have done the teppanyaki, the service can be a little slow.  Each time we spent around  hours there.  The normal tables have pretty good service, nothing to complain on there.  nnOverall this place has great happy hourlunch specials and pretty good food.  I will definitely be a repeat customer when looking for a close teppanyaki or sushi place."
1,"I think that Oyshi is one of the best AYCE sushi restaurants in Las Vegas.  It is a bit of a far drive from the strip and from where I live, but its worth it.

The service there is decent, some servers are friendly some are not.  Ive never had a problem with trying to get a table here.  My only qualms with Oyshi is that they tend to play ravetechno music there that does not match the ambiance.  And they also automatically add gratuity or parties of  or more, when it is usually customary to add gratuity for parties of  or more."
1,"Super love this place! Its a nice cozy place expect long line during the day but its great to go at night specially when its cold, its always nice to have warm soup that taste sooo good and the meat that melts in your mouth. nnIm always craving for their ramen, my favorite is the tonkotsu shoyu ramen. My husband and my cousin literally gave the meaning to good to the last drop. Their fried rice is good also. Very reasonable price."
1,"Just got back from Church Brew Works, as we had a pretty good experience. There were probably  people in the restaurant, but the sprawling size of the place makes it seem empty with that size crowd. Its a really cool space, between the brewing equipment and church relics, so theres a lot to look at and discuss. Theres even lots of helpful info about the history of the place and beer brewing in the menu.nnWe started with the Nontraditional Pierogies as opposed to the Traditional Pierogies which change periodically today they were stuffed with potato, chicken, andouille sausage, peppers, and pepper jack cheese that I can remember and DARN they were tasty, just needed a bit of salt though.nnWe also had fries with beer cheese. The fries themselves were okay, Potato Patch style but a little overdone. The beer cheese was pretty tasty as well.nnFor an entree we had the Cinco Formaggio a name I find quite odd, since cinco is Spanish and formaggio is Italian...but I digress. The combination of cheeses plus pine nuts is mild and yet very yummy, the pine nuts add a nice crunch. The crust is heavenly, though I wish it had a teensy bit more salt and perhaps some butter or olive oil to moisten it a bit.nnWe also, of course, tried a couple beers, which were good in my book but Im not by any means a beer connoisseur, so I cant do much describing other than to say I liked it.nnOur server was very friendly and helpful  checked on us enough times, refilled my water, all that good stuff. All in all we definitely enjoyed the meal and hope to come back for more soon!"
1,"I love ShowBoy Bakeshop. I have been going there since the first day they opened and I am so happy they are in my neighborhood. I have order several different custom cakes from them and I cant count how many cupcakes but I have never once been disappointed. They are always delicious and moist. A cake can be something personal for those special moments in life and the guys at ShowBoy understand that and always make your experience memorable. I will never go anywhere else! Plus, who doesnt love the broadway theme bakeshop!"
1,"Nice to hit a great used recordDVDCD store on the way home from work at pm. A good mix of all types of stuff, I was just annoyed they didnt have one soundtrack I was hoping to get.nnFriendly and helpful staff that knows where their stock is. always nice I have yet to trade anything in, so cant review that aspect, but I do enjoy hitting Zia up once or twice a month."
1,"Sort of a mixed bag with this visit.  We ordered a Roasted Vegetable and Goat Cheese Flatbread Pizza excellent and just the right amount of food, a Parmesan Crusted Chicken Sandwich sandwich was pretty good, but I didnt much care for the fries, and a Chicken Quesadilla overly spicy in a brassy way.  The service was great at the start.  But, by the end, the restaurant had filled up and we had to wait a bit just to get our bill.  Still, overall, a very good meal."
1,"Vegas really offers a wide range of hotel room prices. With the down economy, you can get a nice room at a major Vegas resort for what a Motel Six might run you in another North American city without half of Vegas claim to fame.nnMonte Carlo has recently redeveloped its top floor following a rather nasty hotel fire on the top floor. Theyve recast the top floor as a boutique hotel within a hotel. The  in Hotel  refers to, of course, the nd floor.nnThe cheapest room here is the studio. Its about  a night. Sure you can get a room for  a night in many Vegas top end hotels but the perks at Hotel  really make the price make more sense. First, theres an airport pickup in a real limo. Not a town car. A real limo. Thats pretty heady. And then youre whisked through the check out crowd to a VIP lounge for a private check in. Through the day theres free beverages and snack food. Theres a breakfast and a light dinner. nnThing about Vegas is while they might have lowed the room rates, food aint any cheaper. So a room that comes with some meals, a free airport pickupdrop off at your beck and call can make a few days at Hotel  work.nnThose are the pros. A few consnnThe studios dont appear to have bath tubs. The literature seems to indicate you get an itouch for your stay as well as a pillow menu but none appear to be evident for my stay."
1,"Been to AZ hundreds of times, how did I miss this place!? What a find  I second  third all the excellent breakfast reviews, awesome food and great friendly atmosphere. Not a bad value either considering its AZ, will definitely come here again next trip!"
1,"Came here with my family that drove into town from SoCal for Xmas. Was looking to take them to a nice place for xmaseve dinner and read positive reviews about this place.nnWe ordered many small dishes and  entrees to share Pork belly pastrami, shrimp tomato salad, burrata, crispy chicken gizzards, amaro meatloaf, and panseared scallops. The waitress also recommended the famous chopped salad and boy.... was that the best decision and dish of the night! Every one of the dishes were tasty with the  best dishes being the  salads.nnIll definitely come back to Citizen Public House in the future. Once again.. that chopped salad.... must try!"
1,"Beautiful place! But, as expected from Caesars Palace.  This is where the rich btches go for their daily facials.  I went for the Holiday special.  I enjoyed my facial and all the amenities it offers, private shower stalls, applesbananas, coffeewater.  Professional, touch button password lockers, sandals..etc.  Only thing I didnt like was some of their front desk crew, bunch of newbs.  They screwed up my appointment and didnt explain anything.  However, my facial lady was wonderful and most of the staff were very professional.  My facial lady told me that they are constantly hiring new people at the front desk, so they tend to mess up a lot.  I went w my gf, so I expected to do things together, but due to the Roman bath, everything is pretty much separated, since its a naked hot tub venue.  If youre gay, this is the place to be, I checked out the Roman bath for min since i saw a few couples there staring me down.  No, I wasnt naked!"
1,"today i went on a food tour around town ...  and i first went to a Shanghai restaurant and this place is the second spot i stop in .... gotta tell ya it was just so good ...i ordered a cow brain taco, a pig stomach tacos and one carne asada taco .... the cow brain i dont really recommend it ,wish they coulda doing somethings better with the brain other than just boil it .... but the pig stomach and the carne asada was so good with grilled scallion and fried jalapeno and their salsa ...."
1,"This location is small, but will get the job done!nnLibrarians are helpful if you have a question. There are several scanners available for checkout. While book selection is limited, you can get a book from another library by requesting it and having it sent there for pickup. nnComputers are available. This seems to be a big draw. Most of them are in use all the time. If they are full, you can sign in and you will be assigned a computer and given what time it will be available. On the downside, there is a one hour limit. It will be extended if no one has requested their use. On the plus side, they have a copier hooked in to the computer system. For a small fee, you can print pdf files or any documents from online."
1,"What is not to love about Costco?  Oh, maybe that the bathrooms are so far away, the lines to pay are usually long they do move quickly though or that the snack bar doesnt take debit cards.nnWell, even with these little problems I still love shopping at Costco.  The products are good, the prices are good, the samples are fun and delish and the coupons are a bargain.nnLove my Costco membership!"
1,"This is my goto place for PakistaniIndian cuisine due to its proximity to my home and the exceptional quality of their food. The naan here is simply better than any other  Desi restaurant. My favorite thing to get are the chicken wraps, which I highly recommend. On the few times weve catered from them they have had nice prices and excellently prepared food on a prompt schedule."
1,Soon as I stepped in I get a hello.  you know they are on their game nnFirst time here and they took their time with me helped me out finding a meal that I would like. nI got the classic gyro and fries.nnThe gyro was mouth watering good. They have some of the freshest toppings I have had. The fries..... Omg the feta cheese on them just add a taste that makes you want to jump for joy. nnI will always be back.
1,"We had an ant issue and called APS after calling two other Pest Control companies.  One company never answered their number and the other never showed for the scheduled appointment.  APS came, APS sprayed the house and the next day the ants are gone."
1,"Whoa, I am in heaven. nnA recent review for a place in Chandler made me NEED some Filipino food. Let me back track a few years. nnI worked with a guy who was in charge of hiring for a drug wholesaler, he liked helping friends and family. He was a Polish Filipino. Some of the family he hired were Filipino and would bring Pancit, Lumpia, adobo etc to the potluck type lunches we had. I would even go to family functions with them. I love Filipino food. nnThere was a place near me that closed down and I was left with no where to go. I drove past CFB but at the time it was only a bakery...lame nnAfter seeing the review for the place in Chandler, I had to find a closer place. SO I YELPED... sure enough there it was CFB. It is only  miles from work...sweet. nnI roll in and expect to see a dive but instead see a very clean, and larger then expected dining room. Attached was a bakery full of delights. nnI ordered the Pancit with chicken and veggies. It was freaking good. No soy or spicy sauce ALL the normal flavors. I also asked if I could sample some of the Lumpia and it was perfect, fresh, hot, and awesome. nnI will be back for some Adobo and some pastrys. nnThey have karaoke on Friday, and a live band on Saturday. So you are warned."
1,Checked in on a Friday afternoon for a one night visit. nnPros nearly checkin was FREE before nComfy clean beds. Not too fluffy pillows. nGood locationnLots of dining choicesnSO many places to drink beernNice view from strip view roomnPool was funnGood ACnRoller coaster n beverage credit! How did I get that??nnConsnShade at the pool comes w a cost. nLongest hallways ever. Good luck finding your room if youre drunk. nThe nonstop flushing of our toilet. Had to jiggle the little ballcock hehe thing every flush so basin would fill. Eww. nNo mall type place like Caesars or PH
1,"I cant believe I havent been to this place sooner!  Dueling Pianos  what great entertainment!  The place became very crowded throughout the night.  In the beginning my friend and I were sitting back by the bar area.  It was fun to listen to the music, but we werent really able to see the performers.  Later on, we ventured our way to the front and were able to find a couple of seats  wow, what a difference. It was much more interactive and WAY more entertaining!  So amazing the talent these guys have that perform.  Very wide array of ages at the bar, and a very wide array of music which was nice.  I felt that the bartenders werent very friendly and seemed like they didnt want to be there.nSuper fun place that I could find myself frequently going to. made me miss New Orleans  Pat OBriens!"
1,"The menu is extensive and is dressed in the traditional culinary garb of Cuba they have ropa vieja, paella, tender sirloin steak, the famous Cuban sandwich, shrimp enchilada, slowroasted juicy pork, the traditional fried cow, shrimp, and rice and chicken. All meals are accompanied by white rice and black beans, or colorados. Its a fun and a relaxed atmosphere. nnIn addition the place is pretty clean, and offers live entertainment on the weekends. I couldnt stay for the live music but wished I did. Service was good. The prices are a bit high for Cuban food which is very inexpensive but that is probably due to the fact that this is the nicest Cuban restaurant in the Las Vegas area."
1,"Today I was in a jam, my dad arrives at pm and I pulled out the super high, super cool air mattress last night only to find out that my  year old failed to tell me he managed to break it last summer and there is a large hump and it wont keep air. I bought this through Cabelas last year of course for Dad, so I called customer service to see how long it was under warranty, which turned out to be only  days. Therefore, I had to buy a new one, but there was no way I could get to the store in Glendale to pick it up today, but if I orderedpaid for it, I could have family members that could get it and bring it to me...making my life a lot easier! The  Customer service told me I had to call the store direct, so I did. I cant give you the details because they bent a few rules, but I have to say they were very accommodating and friendly,..and they completely helped me out of a jam! Plus the store price was  less...and I was able to purchase an extended warranty that covers any damage for another year cha, ching!. Thanks for the awesome customer service  days before Christmas!"
1,"I booked this tour last minute through Southwest Airlines vacations.  I would recommend this tour as a highlight of any vacation in the Phoenix, AZ area.  nnSteve, the guy who keeps all the scheduling arranged was amazing.  He worked with us to get just the time we needed to fit in our schedule.nnAlex, our guide was the most affable young man to me he is.  He made everyone feel special he praised our driving skills, was very knowledgable of the local history, as well as knowing his way around in the desert.  nnThis unique tour which allows one to follow a tour guide as one drives a dune buggy like vehicle over very rugged desert dirt paths and river washouts.  We stopped at ancient indian forts learned how to survive in the desert never a concern get some fresh air and many laughs.nnA must do for anyone visiting the area."
1,"Itzza Pizza is the replacement for Gumbys on Madisons near west sidennI had the chicago style stuffed pizza and it was good very big!, but nothing like authentic ginos east or lou malnatis in chicago. The sauce, crust, cheese, and toppings were pretty average and what you would find at places like pizza di roma or glass nickel, at a little cheaper price.nnThe one thing this place has that no one else does PEPPERONI ROLLS. Gumbys had them and they were the best and these are even better!! Theyre soft, chewy, and come with a side of what tasted like thousand island dressing with a kick. Very awesome.nnI would rank this place average in every single quality taste, presentation, location, delivery speed. But the pepperoni rolls won me over. Definitely worth a try."
1,"AMAZING. Ive had a lot of bbq from Alabama, to Georgia, to California and in between, and this place is right up there with the best of them. I had the full slab of ribs one day with baked beans, and then I had the  pound sandwich half chicken and half pulled pork. Blown away"
1,"I have been going to Sunset Auto for years. Been all over Las Vegas and, compared to Los Angeles, many of the auto shops are less than ethical.nnIt was such a ray of sunshine to do business with Sunset Auto. The owner, Mike is very honest and knowledgeable. MD runs the service desk and has been really great to work with. He is careful with your budget and his labor prices are great. When MD quotes a price he stands by his estimate.nnSunset keeps up with high end tech tools and electronic diagnostic equipment required for todays computer driven cars. The technicians are very capable and will not suggest service that is not needed.nnIt is usually like a trip to the dentist when getting your car fixed around Las Vegas and the dealers are among the worst AND the most expensive. They offer average service with high prices. Sunset Auto is such a pleasant experience I almost want to go there just because I know they are so honest and will actually try to help me. nnCount me as another happy customer who would simple never consider taking my trusted cars to anyone else."
1,"You guys need to turn back now, dont go here you will forget it really dont go here! Oh come on who the hell is going to believe that? This place is just as good if not better as Monta and honestly I dont want people to find that out because I dont want it to ever get as packed as monta ALWAYS is. They have more variety here then the normal monta wich is super nice.I came here with my grandfather on .. and I hope I can go there tomorrow  lol I got Tonkotsu with just chashu and butter. Side note I never had butter on ramen before. My grandpa got the fried chicken.nnFRIED CHICKEN  sooo this isnt the crispyst chicken ever but its very good it has nice flavor and you can taste the seasoning wich is cool!nnSOYSAUCEPORK RAMEN Tonkotsu Oh my god when ever I can now I shall get butter on my ramen, you dont think it will make a big difference but it sooo does!!!! Holy cow lol The pork was so tender and melt in your mouth as i remembered mmm missed this soup! So all in all dont come here and dont wright reviews because well...this place is to good for most people haha"
1,"While in Las Vegas for a trade show,  we spent  long days on our feet. On the last day, we called and as luck would have it they were able to come to our hotel within a few hours.  We so enjoyed our massage, it was exactly what we needed.  We were very impressed with the responsiveness and professionalism. We had a hard week at the trade show and their wonderful hands where a welcome touch. We both felt great after the massage and had a relaxing flight home the next day. I am glad you were able to accommodate us on short notice and we will defiantly call again when we are in Las Vegas. If you are in Las Vegas and need or would like a massage, this is the place to call!"
1,"I went this afternoon to return my box and I was a little bothered that I had to wait  minutes just to return my box. anyhow when I was up the guy was very friendly and helpful. Return Tech Sorry I didnt get his name, but he has great customer service skills! awesome job! I dont want to go back, but he was awesome!"
1,"Soo I was unsure about coming here, but I mentioned to someone I would come. I found out about this place on Man V. Food I think or the internet. Anyway, I came all the way from Chandler to N. Phx to try this place. nnI was expecting a more quieter atmosphere at the time but they were blasting the soccer game. Also chips and salsa are not provided. nnThe menu has a lot to choose from, I was soo undecided. However, I came here for the Torta del Rey, so thus that is what I ordered. I want to try to carne asada next time. Anyway, I knew it was going to be a huge sandwich. Lo and behold it was presented to me and all I did was gasp. WOW! It was a sandwich plus potato chips as a side weird.nnLet me remind you I am a nutrition student, this is far from healthy....ham, cheese, egg, chorizo, pork strips, etc. nGreat tasting sandwich, but I much preferred it with the green sauce they provided. I downed that first half in no time, but I could no conquer the whole sandwich. nnGreat big sandwich for , not bad. Considering I could enjoy the other half later on. I would definitely go back to try the other menu items."
1,"This review is for the sports book and specifically for the football season.  During game days, there are  beers and they have a good selection on domestic beers and Coronas.  The sliders  for ,  for  are a disappointment and Ive tried them on  separate occasions.  The ciabatta bread doesnt seem to be the proper choice and the meat is dry and overcooked.  The condiments are excellent, which is why I keep on giving them another chance.  I wish they would simply return to the traditional hot dogs, but they are trying to distinguish themselves from Station properties.   Additional positives are you dont need a reservation for a small television and you get a free drink ticket for a  bet."
1,"Good stay overall.  We were given a corner room with a great golf course view.  The kids enjoyed the pool at night.  The highlight big breakfast spread with made to order omeletspancakes.  Needless to say, we had seconds and thirds.nnA special thanks to Martha for making us feel at home during our night stay."
1,You either get it or you dont...HH is a great place to come for a relaxed meal that will remind you of home cooking but with a twist...Everything is BIGGER and more savory.nnIf you are looking for a wolf gang puck or emeril experience then you dont get it...this is more like your moms home cooking gone wild and much better.
1,"Im quite jealous of Einstein Bros. Bagels.nnIm jealous because no matter how hard I try, I CAN NOT make a bacon, egg and cheese bagel sandwich thats anywhere near as good as theirs. My preferred bagel is Asiago, and I can never seem to find those kinds of bagels in any store. nnAlso, props to making some very good iced coffeewhich is actually cheaper than McDonalds coffee. Sure, you have to mix in sugar and milk yourself, but their coffee is of much better quality.nnThank god they dont have free WiFi, or else I would have no life outside of this place."
1,"Great place with lots of options breakfast, lunch or dinner. Good, consistent staff. Sometimes theres a relatively long wait, but that has improved greatly since they expanded. Favorite drink sangria margarita swirl its REALLY good!! Would definitely recommend if youre in the area!"
1,I have had my dog Penny for  months. I had a lovely pet sitter with her own small company for the first two months but she had to quit because she got a real job. I hired a wellknown company for two months and I was extremely disappointed in my service. I found Mark via Thumbtack and finally decided to change to yet another company. nnMark and his crew have been nothing short of amazing and for significantly less money than the other companies. I was immediately impressed by his professionalism and care at our consultation. I receive prompt texts back if I ever have questions or concerns. The daily texts and pictures are awesome! They clean up the messes if there ever are any and always keep the apartment just as clean as they found it. I feel confident that they are actually walking my dog and that Penny finally has the stability that she needed in a dog walker. It is very evident that Mark values ever customer individually and doesnt treat me as if Im just another customer that he doesnt need like the larger company I dealt with. I would never imagine using another company and highly recommend to any pet owner in the area.
1,"Ive driven past here a million times to have coffee at True Brew how have I not stopped in before?!nIts smack in the middle of a strip mallso youd almost miss it if you didnt know it was there.nWe went on a Friday night and it was jam packed. nWe sat out on the patio, which does a great job of disguising its parking lot with black out shades.nA great family vibe, and really tasty thin crust pizza I had the marguerita pizza..so good!!nDefinitely a new fave pizza spot for me."
1,"I took a cooking class with Chef Eddie Matney Eddies House Restaurant and his recipe called for Vanilla bean olive oil from the Olive Mill. First off, what he made with this recipe was phenomenal much thanks to that smooth vanilla olive oil in there! I decided to google this place only to find out that Chef Beau Macmillan acclaimed a the kalamata sandwich from there as his bad boy favorite. I dont know what a bad boy favorite even means but it has to be good especially since Ive had his food and was quite impressed. nnI decided to make the  minute drive from Scottsdale out there on a Sunday afternoon to get my olive oil and try this kalamata sandwich. Such a cool atmosphere inside. Its like a trader joesgift shopparadise bakery all with a rural, kinda on the farm feel. You could easily kill an hour here just looking around at all the stuff for sale.  nnI couldnt believe the kalamata sandwich! If you go there and order anything else....youre wrong. Freshest ingregients Ive ever tasted. I feel like the pork could have just been butchered  minutes prior to me ordering it and the vegetables just picked from their garden which they do have there. nnPretty cool how you can sample the endless flavors of olive oil there. Got myself the vanilla bean and the blood orange as well. Make for some unstoppable pancakes. nnTried the gellato and wasnt all that impressed. But in all due fairness, Im not exactly sure what real gellato is supposed to taste like since all Ive had is gelleto spot and grateful spoon.nnDefinitely worth the drive! Great place to bring the family."
1,"I LOVE this place.  I was never a big fan of Middle Eastern cuisine.  That is, until my coworkers made me eat there with them.  The employees who work there treat you as if youve been coming in for years and are very funny.  My favorite meal there is the Falafel plate good for vegetarians accompanied by a large lemonade.  The lemonade is without a doubt the best lemonade ive ever had.  This place is definitely as good as it gets, nothing bad to say about it at all."
1,Short rib tacos!!!nnAbsolutely amazing experience.nnPolite and courteous waitstaff.  nnBest short rib tacos Ive ever experienced.  My wife had the surf and turf platter  also fantastic.nnAmazing guacamole.nnThe other couple we were with were also suitably impressed.  I was so fixated on my dinner that I dont even remember what they had.  nnIncredible abbey ale tap.nnRed velvet cake w gelato  wow!!!nnSea salt chocolate chip cookies on the way out ... perfect end to the evening.
1,"I am new to Phoenix so I did a quick Google search for doctors in my area.  Thank you Google, you totally hooked it up.  I have only been there twice now but I feel like Ive been going there forever.  Everyone is so lovely and thorough.  Ive been to several doctors over the last several years because of insurance or lack there of but Im very excited to have found a practice with a doctor who tells me what I need to hear with compassion not judgement.  And hes funny!"
1,We used GSS for our wedding.  Their smores cake is amazing!  They nailed the design we were looking forthe cake was so beautiful!  I received numerous compliments on the cupcakes as welleveryone said they were delicious.  The only reason they didnt get a star rating is because the cake was difficult to cut through during the cake cutting ceremony.  But flavorwise everything was on point!!!
1,"We went here on our anniversary with some culture passes from the library. These allow you to get in free as long as you visit within a week of checking out the culture pass. I am so greatful to the Botanical Gardens for partiipating in this. It was our th anniversary, and our wedding was at the Cleveland Botanical Gardens. We thought it would be nice to visit and compare. nnWe went early, but I still should have brought a hat. nnThe glass sculptures are amazing and you HAVE to try the Prickly Pear Iced Tea! Its unsweetened and infussed with the essense of the flower, so you dont get the sugar of the fruit but the flavor is great. They need to bottle this stuff....maybe they do? Didnt see any in the gift shop though. nnThe staff was very friendly, and gave us great advice, and stopped to take our picture as well. nnMy only real complaint is the lack of indoor exhibits. I think there was one closed butterfly exhibit and a closed auditorium Dont know what they use that for. nnLoved the hummingbirds, butterflys, and took many great pictures!"
1,"It was a done deal after we saw Snow Flake shaved ice right next to where we were having lunch!  The whole family shared a large ice with black sesame and strawberry ice, red bean, Oreo, and sweetened condensed milk toppings!!  Completely awesome."
1,"What a nice little surprise. I probably would have never picked this place to go eat but was out on a bachelorette party and ended up going with the ladies. nnIt is a fun atmosphere and they have great cocktails in pitchers!! WOO HOO PITCHERS!! The one we ordered tasted like candy! nnShared a bunch of appetizers and pizzas. They start you off with some amazing garlic bread. We followed it with the giant meatball it really is giant . Some Calamari which was good though I am not a huge fan of Calamari. nnNext was the beet salad and the Ceaser salad, both were crisp and fresh. We followed this off with  pizzas. It was too much food for  girls and we had some pizza left over. All three pizzas we tried were yummy and packed with flavors. nnOverall it was very reasonably priced as well. The manager came by, congratulated the bride to be and made us a round of shots. Great service, great experience I will definitely be back next time I am in Vegas."
1,"Played here with my dad whos a local. Hes played pretty much everywhere and he says that this is one of the best that hes played. I agree. We usually play Raven at Verrado and I love that course... but I think its only better because its in the middle of nowhere. No houses, no cars, no highways... nothing. With that said... its in the opposite side of where my parents live so its a pain in the arse to make my way out there. I feel like all dessert courses are similar so I probably wont make my way out there again especially since I have Raven. But regardless, all the accolades and attention this course is getting is legit. Id give it  stars but Im not a huge fan of dessert golf... I love trees and rough."
1,Used to go to the YMCA and before that Pure Fitness.  Koko lets you use just one machine to do the whole workout. No waiting for twelve machines to do it. The staff is very helpful. The machines keep track of your progress and add weight and repetitions as you get stronger. Treadmills and ellipticals for cardio. Ive lost weight already in a few weeks and Im in much better shape.
1,FANTASTIC!!!  OMG!  I am a picky eater and this buffet was GREAT!  There was so much to choose from and the desserts were to die for!  The gelato was delicious... Mexican and Asian cuisine  was mouth watering.... Can not wait to go again!
1,"I know this place isnt Ceasars or the Bellagio.  The rooms are modern and nice, but what really makes this place special and close to the heart, are the beds!  Yes, the beds!  After partying til  or  in the morning, nothing makes your body feel like a million angels kissing you all over your body than these heaven sent beds.  If God slept on a bed, this would be it! I mean there is no comparison, NONE!"
1,"Tonys is a fairly small operation that seems to get most of its business from the Wells Fargo center across the street and the apartment complex that its attached to.  The pizza is New York style, so this means that the slices are abnormally large.  Typically, a slice of cheese and slice of pepperoni are enough for my dinner.  Pizza is sold by the slice as well as whole pies.  If I remember correctly, only cheese and pepperoni are available by the slice.  They also have cheese steaks, stromboli, calzones, and other Italian fare.nnThe location is clean and has a good atmosphere for dining in.  Extra cheese and red pepper is located behind the counter or near the fountain drink station.  The prices are fairly cheap, I dont believe there is anything other than a large pizza that is more than  on their menu.  Slices run around .  .."
1,"Booked a Swedish massage here with my friend while visiting Vegas. We had a great time! The price was very reasonable, especially compared to spas at the hotel. Just off the strip. Took a cab, and got there in a few minuets. The place was very clean and friendly. I absolutely love the duecor. You definitely feel like your in Vegas!  In a fun way, not like your at a sleazy massage parlor. I was nervous about booking a massage in Vegas, but I will definitely be coming back here next time Im in town!"
1,"I have now been here multiple times and each time the food is better and better.  nnI cant speak for a variety of foods, but I can say that the Pho is some of the best that I have ever had.nnIt is served with the traditional accompaniments of hoisin, sriracha,  hot peppers, bean sprouts, lime, cilantro, and thai basil as well as culantro which I had not had before sort of like a milder cilantro.nnThe service is always excellent and the prices are competitive with the other restaurants in the area. nnI will definitely be back and often!"
1,"Wow...this custard really does live up to the hype.  I got the pineapple flavor today without any toppings or extras and I was blown away.  I have had my share of custard from places in the Bay Area and this one really surprised me in terms of how creamy and rich it is without making my stomach feel like I ate a pound of cream or butter.  nnIm not sure if the location near the OG is helpful or not but it certainly cant hurt to have tasty custard only a couple of footsteps away from their establishment.nnNote there were actual pieces of pineapple in the custard which was really a treat.  nnWill be back when I come back to LV!nnSign on their window Cash only, no bills over"
1,"Republica Empanada is the perfect little lunchtime gem Ive been looking for in the area. I almost dont want to sing its praises because it is at the top of my lunchtime list and I dont want to throw any elbows for a seat. But. It deserves some love, so Ill share I guess.nnWhats not to love about empanadas? Its the latin american equivalent of a hot pocket but instead of processed bread and mystery meat, theres no mystery and tons of flavor. RE does empanadas right with a perfectly flaky crust that serves as a sleeping bag for quality fillings of beans and cheese, potato, pork and even figs. Two is enough to fill me up at lunch, but I could probably eat more if naptime were an option afterwards. My favorite so far is the El Capitan which is a mixture of ground beef, green olives, hard cooked eggs and raisins. I know, I hate raisins too, but it works in this empanada. I also really like the bean and cheese empanada which is simple but so good. The only one I havent cared for so far was the potato which I felt was under seasoned and just didnt work for me texturewise. nnThe lunch time special is greatfor . you get two empanadas selection of which ones qualify for the lunch special changes daily with rice and beans. Its just enough food to be satisfied without leaving that postlunch food hangover. They also have a fantastic early week special that runs Monday and Tuesday PP of four empanadasfour beers OR a bottle of wine for the baller on a budget price of . It makes for a great happy hour, particularly on Mondays, because Mondays are just hard.nnThe decor is super cute and they have an enclosed patio which is a plus come summertime. The inside layout features a dining bar that stretches almost the length of the restaurant and then a handful of two and four tops. Its not the biggest space, so I imagine it can get pretty crazy during the lunch time rush which Ive never witnessed because Im always hungry by , which makes my lunchtime no later than .nnIf you work in the area or are just passing through downtown Mesadefinitely worth a stop!"
1,"Im giving Orange Sky a solid four stars for a great experience. Its not my favorite restaurant in town, but it definitely one that impressed me beyond belief! nnI visited Orange Sky months back when Talking Stick first opened and explored the restaurant sans guests, so I knew what I was walking into. However, I must say that it was even better the second time I went! nnTime was running out to participate in Restaurant Week so we looked at the list of restaurants and decided that this was the perfect chance to try Orange Sky. Luckily we made reservations because when we arrived, they said that it was full until  PM this was at . Upon arrival at the hostess stand at the bottom floor, I noticed that they have a really strict dress code no tshirts, cutoffs, flip flops, shorts, and some others that I cant remember. Once they checked our reservation, we got into the elevator and I was pleasantly surprised to see that one of the walls is glass, allowing us to look out on the desert as we zipped up. We arrived on the th floor and walked out into a lively lounge equipped with patios, plenty of seating and even a pianist singing classic tunes. nnThe restaurant itself is intimate and very much like a restaurant you would find in a large city. Glass windows line the restaurant and they have plenty of private seating. They have rooms to the right that seat roughly  people, including a wine rack room. To the left, they have private niches that seat between  people with windows looking out on the skyline. The main section of the restaurant has plenty of booths and tables as well as other tables along the windows. Then the rooftop patio has couch seating as well as regular tables. They even offer lightup menus since its dark. The patio would be a wonderful place to sit and grab drinks and food and they even have a staircase that goes directly down into the club on the th floor. nnMoving on to the food, it was pretty good. I started with the Artichoke bisque, followed by the game hen and ended the meal with a chocolate tarte. Everything was tasty. A couple things I noticed that stood out was when I asked our waitress what appetizer she suggested off of the prix fix menu, she said she didnt like one and hadnt tried the other and really did a pretty poor job of selling any of the items. I opted for the bisque without high expectations and it was a lot better then she sold it to be! Then for the wine, another waiter came by and asked us if we wanted refills on our cocktails. My bf opted for another beer and said so but I still had a half of glass of wine so didnt order another one. The second beer shows up and the next thing I know the waiter is pouring wine into my glass. I stopped him and said I didnt order a glass of wine and he said he thought he heard me say I did. I said I hadnt and at this point it was too late because the wine was already poured in. However, the waiter was very nice and since I hadnt asked for the wine, they didnt end up charging us for it. nnIn summary, I like Orange Sky and this is definitely a great option for date night, if you have visitors in town, or if you are staying at the casino. Its worth it to go for the ambiance alone."
1,"I really like this place. For lunch its quick, easy and tasty! I went here a few weeks ago with a coworker and got a lunch to go. I had the veggie freak with a cup of white bean soup. OMG. It just tastes wholesome! Not heavy, not buttery, not gross. The lobby is clean, kinda small but still has the mom and pop feel to it. The menus are written in chalk on the wall and are colorful and friendly. I dont know if Id go here to sit and eat inside due to the limited space  or so small tables but it was terrific for lunch to go. The sandwich had an Italian dressing on it which was very refreshing and fresh tasting. And the lady who brought out our orders even told me to be careful with the soup in the car. Aww, I dont get that a paradise bakery or subway when Im getting their soups.  I hope this place stays right where it is since I have a feeling my coworker and I will be back for more!"
1,"This place is incredibly beautiful and although outside of the fountains there is nothing really unusual or special as is the norm on the strip, you cant help but feel that this is THE hotel to be at in the city.  We stayed for five days and every staff member was super friendly.  Recommend highly!"
1,"I went in with rockethigh expectations of the food here since its reputed to be the best Thai food in N.America.   While the food was really good, I dont know that it necessarily lived up to its reputation, at least the night we were there.nnPer the friendly waiters recommendations, we had their signature deepfried sour sausage appetizer, which was a unique starter.  It looks like deepfried rice, actually, when it comes out, but apparently yes folks, that IS sausage.    Very strong flavors of sourness from the lime juice?, hot chilis spiciness can be to your requested level and lots of other complex flavors all put into a very tasty combination.   nnWe moved onto their spicy beef, drunken seafood noodles, spicy seafood salad, and tom kah kai soup.nnSpicy beef   stars.   GREAT flavors, down to the lime juice  infused bed of cabbage that the beef is sitting on.nnDrunken seafood noodles   stars.  Good, but not lifechanging.  Nice combination of lots of seafood imitation crab, squid, shrimp, and ooh even a mussel was thrown in there!nnSpicy shrimp salad  . stars.  You can request the spiciness to the level of your comfort, and we asked for medium.   We found the dish to be flavorful, but a bit too salty and a bit too spicy for our tastes.  I felt overwhelmed by the dish after a couple bites and couldnt really eat much more.nnTom kha kai soup  . stars.  VERY wellbalanced, complex, fresh flavors.nnNo room for dessert, though I was very tempted to get coconut ice cream just to put out the fire in my mouth and mellow out all the strong flavors Id just ingested.nnDefinitely a good place to go if you like Thai food andor strong  spicy flavors, but I dont know that its the best Thai food in N. America."
1,"Its hard to give a gas station props for providing gas. So I usually just think if their card reader works and I can get gas, my expectations have been met. So why do I give this place an extra star? Easy its right by work, the credit card readers always work, and its never that full.nnAlso, I kinda like the car wash here."
1,"YES!!! this was soo good, a little messy but good. It is at a farmers market on Wed and Saturdays from ampm ish. I went around  and the wasnt a big line.nnI got my dog pretty fast and wow was it amazing. I got the Aiko with a Hot Beer Dog. The spices were perfect and soo tasty. The Aiko had Mango Chutney, Jalapenos, Mayo, something else but i cant remember. This was served on flatbreadpita or whatever you want to call it. It was quite different way to eat your dog, but wow I love the idea and it was super good. nnGot my food in about  minute wait, there isnt really too many tables to sit at so prepare to be friendly with some strangers or learn how to stand and eat. I am not afraid of strangers yet soo i sat with one and ate. nnBe aware if you have big sleeves food will fall in it ... mango chutney was in my jacket sleeve...soo my arm smelled REAL good after. I did get a complain that my breath smelled like mango chutney...but whatever i think they were just jealous of me getting some good food nnoh yeah  dollar a specialty dog...heck yes good deal, it filled me up!"
1,"This place is a complete dive, and a great one at that.  Great place to start the evening.  Yes its a dirty bar with weirdos but the service is great and none of the weirdos will bother you.nnHere is all you need to knownOne block from the stripn  for a beer and hot dog"
1,"My girls age    love coming here for the Parents Night Out.  It costs me  each to drop them off to play and have pizza from pmpm.  nnI wish the hours were pm to pm instead.  Also, my daughter said the pizza wasnt very good last time.nnHowever, the pros outweigh the cons and we are fans."
1,"We used to shop at the other big baby store, but we had so many bad experiences that we decided to drive the extra distance and try out buybuy Baby. Since that time we have been lured back into the other store by gift cards and great coupons, but found that even with those attractive offers we still regretted going back.nnbuybuy Babys service is top notch. Their staff are very knowledgeable about the safety products. Everyone is over the top helpful and nice.  We have also found that we like the products at buybuy Baby better."
1,"Want great service, great food? This is a great spot for a romantic dinner, or just some great grub before a night on the strip. Been twice, different meals each time and EVERY TIME GREAT!!!! Little pricey on the drinks, great value with the food, considering the  items you get before you even get a menu. Cheese, bread, something else I didnt try, and even some muscles!!! AWESOME PLACE!!!!!"
1,"Private entrance, friendly check in staff. Automated elevators which is cool, although they did take us to the wrong floor multiple times. Once you check in the room, they deliver tea and cookies, although i kinda wanted to get it on with my wife right away.nMy biggest issue, was that it was our first time there and they put us on the bottom floor. At night we could hear the club music and our view was the rooftop. now MIND you, they put up huge dioramas of asian scenery to offset this, which was AWESOME, but being a business owner myself, you always want to put on a good show for someone, the first time they use your business."
1,"This restaurant is a long time favorite of mine. Im a little embarrassed that I always get the exact same thing. But I have to say I often crave it. The veggie frittata with feta, home fries, and delicious toast. Its a real treat. The owner is so lovely and always really kind to us."
1,"I ate at Rounders the other day for the first time and was super impressed!!nThe bar and gaming area is perfect and comfortable, with great TVs for sports. They even have a separate dining room that is smoke free! The food and service was awesome!nnSpecial thanks to Larissa our waitress!  Friendly, knowledgeable, and fun, she took great care of us and made our dining experience really special!  She made the perfect recommendations, and everything was served quickly and correctly....thanks again for helping make our evening so enjoyable!nnIf you havent been here yet, try it! The food is great, and the service is top notch!"
1,"I am choosing  stars because Yelp designates it As good as it gets.  I have yet to have an actual good experience with a car dealership  so this one was As good as it gets.  I havent used their service department, but the purchasing process was x less abusive than any of the VanTuyl dealerships.  They didnt throw a bunch of extra stuff on in the finance process, and things went much more quickly  at least half the time it took us to get through Showcase Honda the last time we bought a car.  I wouldnt discourage anyone from going to Chapman."
1,"Had a wonderful lunch. Had the Good Earth Pita! It was out of this world good!  Lots of vegetarian, vegan and gulten free salads, sandwiches, and desserts. Friends of mine had the Complicated Order and  California Turkey both were awesome. Great coffee. and extensive tea menu. Great food, super friendly and knowledgeable staff. Will be back!"
1,"I thought of trying this place on my way to work. I wasnt sure if they had any vegetarian options, and I was pleasantly surprised to see a vegetarian friendly menu. nnI ordered a medium size veggie turkey sandwich and it was huuuuge!!! I had half for lunch and saved the other half for dinner. The sandwich was very tasty, I loved everything in it  the veggies, specially sweet peppers and pickles, mock turkey and thin slices of cheese...perfect for me!nnTwo days later, I was there again and ordered the vegetarian cheese steak sandwich, this time a small size   It was still  though! I loved this sandwich too! Its a hot sub with mock steak fried with veggies of your choice. Seriously, I love sweet peppers the most!!!nnI am always on a lookout for places offering mock meats and hardly knew of much options before  Green and Cornish Pasty are ones I like! I was overjoyed to see this place sitting so close to my work place. Great place for quick lunchesdinners and prices are not super cheap but affordable. The best part  their soy meats ACTUALLY taste good! I have been to numerous mockmeat places, and the meats are tasteless, bland and so disappointing. But Capriottis is different. nnI am going to try the veggie cheeseburger and veggie cole turkey sandwich next. Cant wait! D"
1,"We are close enough to walk here.  Its been in the neighborhood for a long time.  Last year we came on Fridays several times for the  appetizers and really enjoyed them.  The same thing we are enjoying tonight!  The fried calamari was light and crispy, served with a pretty good dipping sauce, and the crab and artichoke dip was served pipping hot!  It had big chunks of crab inside.nnI ordered the blackened Mahi Mahi fish tacos, it was a little disappointing, the fish had hardly any flavor and were small.  I have had better items from their menu.  The prices are good, the service is excellent, overall, its a good place for some fairly decent seafood."
1,"i love my italian food and this place is great specially for a non traditional chain type of italian restaurant. the prices are really reasonable, always great service and a nice atmosphere. there complimentary breads are also really good.  i have been there a half dozen times and never had an issue. i recommend taking advantage of the valet parking as the parking situation in piedmont is not always to convenient."
1,I came here to get a battery replacement after work one day and Leo helped me out. My battery was still under warranty which was great since I had just got back from Christmas vacation! But what made this experience a great one was I received an education on corrosion. Leo not only explained to me what it can do to your engine if not properly handled but then he proceeded to spend a good amount of time cleaning my battery connectors to help alleviate the problem. This Auto Zone is on my way home and I will definitely use it in the future...
1,"John showed up earlier then what he had initially stated, and yes a really cool truck.  He determined the problem and pulled out his magic wand and got out AC working in a matter of minutes. It took a bit to locate the part we needed since this is not a part normally carried on his truck.but . he took care of it as fast as he could and had the AC working before he left to find this part circuit card. What a pleasure to work with him, the price we reasonable and i WILL DEFIANTLY CALL HIM AGAIN FOR AND HEATING OR AC ISSUES.  Get the most for for you buck, call  John , and i promise you the he will take care of any issue you might have.  Did I mention his cool truck?"
1,"Although this place is technically in Henderson and not Las Vegasproper, Im going to say it I think Vegas does beat SF in all forms of Japanese food. It was hard for me to find a quality Shabu place in Vegas that even matched what I was used to in the Bay Area, but Shabu Shabu Paraside has blown everything out of the water for me!nnThis place isnt huge by any means, so reservations are a must. At first I thought we were lost, since we ended up at a strip mall where nothing else looked occupied. Luckily, the Best of Las Vegas sign confirmed we were in the right place. I never have been able to finish my plates of meat at any shabu shabu place, but I finished the Jacksized portion here because it was simply delicious and mouthwatering. The veggies are fresh and AYCE. The one con I would say is mushrooms dont come with it, but they can be ordered as a side for  and you get your choice of two different kinds. Their ponzu sauce has a very bright flavor, their sesame sauce tastes like the best aspects of Kare Kare sauce Filipino dish with a peanut sauce base, and their spicy sauce was unfortunately too spicy for me, but Im sure does the trick for those requiring that kick of heat. They have an array of ice cream options for dessert and they gave me a great idea of a dish to do at home  vanilla ice cream with matcha green tea powder on top. Service here never left us wanting, even when it got super busy. One server was juggling everyone effortlessly and never missed a beat. I will definitely be making the trip out to Henderson to enjoy this place again!.. Honestly, as soon as we left, I was already eager to go back."
1,"I felt guilty for coming here because I am loyal to another local Peruvian chicken place. Just had to get that off of my chest.nnBut this is more of a California type of fresh rather than a homey, hole in the wall type of restaurant. So actually, it is completely different from Pio Pio.nnI had the aptly named, The Great sandwich and it was amazing and incredibly well priced. nnThe service was super friendly and the atmosphere matched the bright, fresh flavors of the food.nnIt is a winner for all these reasons and because it is a few blocks from my house.nnGlad to see this place open because this unit has been cursed.. even Starbucks closed here.. They are here to stay."
1,"We tried the fried pickle chips......yum! The cheese munchies.....yum! A really chill, relaxed atmosphere. I asked the bar tender about their whore ales and gave me additional samples outside of what I ordered. Definitely will be back."
1,"Good BBQ, but it didnt really wow me. Possibly its because I didnt get the burnt ends, but they were out of that by the time I strolled in on a Saturday night. Wasnt too long of a wait for me, only about  couples ahead of me and the gf. Got seated at the bar and had an unfriendly waitress. She just seemed stressed and unhappy. Heard her say to another table that it was a long day, so tried not to bother her with anything. I waited until she left and asked another waitress for a different bbq sauce with my meal ha. Anyway, I ordered the rib tips since they guy next to me got it and it looked delicious. It was alright, nothing crazy. I got one of the vinegar bbq sauces first and didnt like it at all. Thats when I got the Georgia one which was a lot better and thicker. The twice baked potato casserole, I think it was called, was delicious. The potato salad was meh, you could probably skip on that. nnThe gf got the chicken salad which came with a bunch of crackers. It was a different style on chicken salad so not really sure what to compare it too. It was alright though. We also split some corn bread and that was meh too. I think it was over hyped in my mind from some of these other reviews. Over all it was alright, wasnt too expensive either and you get a pretty decent amount of food. Had to take some home since there was so much so thats always a positive. One day Ill try those burnt ends....one day...."
1,"Ok. So I admit Im a total girly girl and I dont know how to put air in my tires. Ive just never cared to learn. Plus it doesnt help that my dad has always been my go to person for my car needs. nnIve had the pleasure of always having low tire pressure. Must be my amazing Asian driving skills. nnAnyway, everyone has always been so friendly with my ignorance of tire pressure. So heres how the convo sounds. nnMe Um yeah hi, the little exclamation point light on my dash is on. nTire guy ok just pull your car into this empty spot and we will check it for you. nnTire guy does his thing and puts air in my tires.nTire guy yeah your front passenger was  pounds under and your front driver was at a  PSI.nMe um ok just make the light go away thanks. nnIve never had a problem with them taking advantage of my unknowingness. I would totally recommend this location to anyone with a flat. Only thing, wait times can be a little long right when they open up."
1,"The service here was absolutely outstanding our salesman Sean Shin was very very knowledgable, friendly and professional not once did I feel rushed or obligated. From the front desk  associate Anika, to the sales manager Arthur whom helped us greatly, We are very thankful and happy with our purchase. Also John in finance was patient and great. We will be returning."
1,"Never have I been to a Margaritaville before. I wasnt sure what to expect. nnCons first nPacked, but is that really a con?  Its Vegas on the strip, what isnt packed. We sat at one of the many bars so we didnt have to wait. nnProsnDelicious!!  We didnt get anything I would categorize as special, just some club sandwiches and fries. Oh my goodness!!  They were amazing!  nOur server was attentive and friendly. nIt was entertaining with the skits they put on every hour or so I guess.  nClean and appropriate decor. nnOverall Id list it as a win in vegas."
1,"I have mixed feelings about Paradise Bakery.  nnPrimarily, when I think about Paradise Bakery, their baked good come to mind.  I love their cookies and muffins.  Chocolate Chip and Oatmeal Raisin are two of my favorite cookies, and the Blueberry Muffins are outstanding.  I recently tried some of my wifes Cranberry scone and became a quick fan of those as well.nnIve also taken my family for lunch or dinner here a few times, and each time Im left regretting the decision.  The kids menu is very limited, and none of my kids have been able to find something they like.  Ive tried a few items from the menu, and I liked one of the sandwiches primarily the Turkey Cranberry.  Most of the other items were okay, but nothing terribly special.  With the high prices, it just doesnt make sense.nnBottom line great place to get some treats, but Id pass on lunch or dinner."
1,"This is a great place to grab breakfast or lunch in a casual atmosphere. They offer a very comfortable dining experience with flat screen tvs throughout. We came for a preflight breakfast on a Monday. The prices here are very reasonable. In addition to their regular menu, they offer several daily specials. A few of the specials they offered on this particular Monday morning were Steak  Eggs for ., all you can eat pancakes for ., and bottomless coffee for .. My party went with the steak  eggs special, biscuits and gravy, and bottomless coffee. Everything was great. The only downside is that the service was slooooow."
1,"They are located inside the Excalibur.  We stopped in for lunch and WOW it was THE BEST Italian food I have ever eaten! We ordered the thin crust pizza with everything and it was outta this world good.  They brought us warm bread while we were waiting for the food to arrive, which was also good and we both walked away stuffed.  It was a little pricey but worth it in my opinion. My only regret was not being able to go back and try some other dishes before we left but will be going back to Vegas in a couple of months and cant wait to eat here again."
1,"Ive been in about  times and have yet to be disapointed. Chicago beef sandwich with hot peppers and liquid cheddar is amazing. Chicago dogs are also about as chicago as it gets without flying there. Fries, onion rings, fried mushrooms...all are excellent. My dad even prefers their burgers over many others. Great food, great service, and very clean every single time ive been in. Compared to other Surprise joints, this place kicks ass."
1,"They have very good pizza.  The pizzas are large, delicious, and reheat well you will have leftovers if you get a large for  peoplenn They have a great beer list, though it seems like they are always out of whatever I want.  A lot of craft beer on tap, and a lot more in bottles.  Excellent.nn The service is usually pretty good and its a fun place to go with a few friends.nnIve never tried a sandwich or anything but their pizza, but then again, why would I?  If it wasnt for the debacle that is parking on or near Ellsworth on a weekend night, Id go here more regularly."
1,"As prepared as I was to give this place a  star review, when I received my check and saw that I was charged for refills, it definitely bumped Tennessee Grill down a peg. Who doesnt give free refills on fountain drinks and iced tea anymore? nnThe food was quite good. Loved the house made potato salad and the fresh cut Tornado fries. The chicken wrap I had was WONDERFUL. The pulled pork was tender albeit a bit dry. Tennessee Grill prefers you dress your own bbq..which is fine but keep the pork in its juices or something. nnWe will go back in the future and just have water for drinks but definitely will do more exploring of the menu."
1,"Ive been to Giuseppes many times since living in AZ for the last  years. My family and I just recently went there to celebrate our March Birthday Extravaganza!  I wish I took pics of the food but was distracted.  We brought wine, cash and presents.  When you walk in the door Giuseppe himself welcomes you and gives you a hug.  He does know some of us but I have a feeling thats how he treats everyone.  I grew up eating homemade sauce and pasta so were very picky about Italian Food.  Giuseppes passes the test.  I know different regions in Italy cook different styles of food, so I think Giuseppe definitely came from the same region as my Grandmother and her father.nnWaitersfriendly and warm.  Foodfresh and delectable. Atmospherehomey."
1,"Love this place for a quick evening in meal! Delivery is crazy fast and the food is great! Favorite is the crab puffs, the pupu platter and lettuce wraps......I am an appetizer person since I can never make my mind up but have also had a couple of main dishes and everything has been great! My husband had been on a search for a new place since we moved to Gilbert and found this place and now its our go to which is a lot to say because he is so picky! He enjoys anything spicy they have and always gets their spicy soup. Its not expensive so what do you have to lose......try it out it may become your new we dont know what to do for dinner fav place!"
1,"Yes, its a chain however this place is truly a chain done well. It is one of my go to places for either a quick bitelunchfull dinner. This place has not let me down. Its really nice to have consistency in food quality sometimes.  I guess over the years I have probably eaten  times. Its always a good choice if you are a seafood lover. Is it the best seafood you can get, no but it truly is goodtime and again."
1,"We had lunch at Bernards on a Tuesday.  We arrived a little after noon, and there was only  table.  Within the next  minutes,  more tables were seated.  I felt for Rosemarie, she was the only server and had to act as hostess as well.  But, she did a FANTASTIC job.   star service, cant believe she handled it so well.  The place was nearly full and we never had to wait for water refills, didnt have to wait for the check, and our food came out timely.  I felt bad they left her alone, but I hope she did well in tips, because she certainly earned them.nnThey have a decent wine list, maybe a dozen or so by the glass, including at least half a dozen French options by the glass.  We were given bread, which was standard French bread, and butter very soon after we sat down.  The butter was very cold, not rock hard, but difficult to spread.  Thats an annoyance, but Ive seen places that give you basically frozen butter, so Bernards certainly is not the worst offender Ive seen.  The wife had the French onion soup to start.  This was a great version of this dish, had the requisite ooey gooey cheese with the crouton that was flavored by the broth and the onions.  Very good. nnTo eat, she had the mushroom and chicken crepes and I had the roast beef sandwich. The sandwich is served open faced with a huge pile of greens in the middle.  The roast beef was okay, average Id say, but I really liked the horseradish sauce.  I should have asked for more.  I doubt I get this sandwich again, which isnt to say I didnt like it.  I just think Ill try something else next time.nnThe wifes crepes were winners.  Smothered in melted cheese, they had a rich and cream sauce and were FULL of chicken and mushrooms.  You got the flavor of every ingredient in every bite.  These are definite repeats.nnBernards has a cool atmosphere.  Its a little cluttered, and they have a lot of Frank Sinatra stuff and a lot of Titanic stuff.  But, its a cozy place with indoor and outdoor seating.  Also, the bathrooms were very clean.  Well return and give it a shot for dinner."
1,"Great staff, very helpful in wine suggestions. nice place to people watch in the palazzo shopping area.... I personally love to do a wine flight right next to DVF nHad a FANTASTIC kenneth wright Pinot Noir due to a staff recommendation soooo good! Wine shop next door to buy selections... good cheese platter as well.nnDefinitely would come back here... different vegas type of vibe."
1,"Seriously delicious!  As someone who is wary of Mediterranean food in general, I felt like I was taking a risk when I decided to come here. Any feelings of apprehension disappeared when I walked in the door.nnThe atmosphere is fresh, clean, and modern.  There are pictures on the wall drawn by children that put you at ease.  The cashier who took our order was so friendly and polite even gave us free pita and hummus since it was our first time.  The food was brought out in a timely manner.nnI had the Greek chicken marinara over orzo and it was amazing.  My side Greek salad with the Greek dressing was so tasty, and the pita and hummus was very refreshing.  My friend let me taste his fish of the spinach wraps with chicken and it was fresh tasting and yummy  Id order that next time, myself.  A bite if my friends dude quinoa salad was light and crisp tasting as well, Id get that next time for myself.nnExcellent good place that puts you at ease and feeds you well.  Cant ask for more!"
1,"This is the sort of place I only ever came with my mum, because I never really appreciated it. Turns out, its a pretty good wine shop!!nThey have a huge selection and almost always have really good deals on.nThe staff here are really friendly too , and happy to help. They can order in a bottle if youre looking for something specific. Very reliable and very good!"
1,Fun vibrant place downtown. We went for Taco Tuesday. Carnitas Tacos . and . Coronitas. Very good. Some of the best Tacos Ive had in Vegas   Service was average but very friendly. Looking forward to returning
1,I take my wife here all the time.  Its a great date place.  The food is always good and the staff is always knowledgeable of the wines and paring them with foods.  We havent had a bad glass or bottle yet.  My wife likes to order their Cherry Lemon Drop Martini and I have to admit I enjoy it too.nnThe food is always prepared with care and Ive always enjoyed a cheese plate or a Flight of wines with their recommended cheese pairings.nnI would like to extend my kudos to Barry.  He is the reason I kept returning as he has what it takes to take the front of the house experience to the next level.
1,"My favorite venue.nnWe dont have any good venues on the west side so Ill willingly drive thirty minutes out of my way to come here.nnIts an all around great venue with the big shows being upstairs  The Nile and the smaller, more intimate shows downstairs The Underground. nnThe staff are great and treat the musicians insanely well which is rare in this state.nnFrom the perspective of an audience member and musician who has played and gone to shows at this venue for years Id recommend going to a show out at this place or booking a show here."
1,"I dont say this lightly, and Im surprised Im saying this at all.nnThis is actually the best Italian food I had EVER and that counts Italy as well. It was hearty, flavorful and the service was simply fantastic. It tasted like they made quite a few things on site too.nnThe menu was also manageable unlike some Italian places. My favorite is how you can order items family style. Everything was delicious through and through from the appetizers goat cheese is a plus to the cannoli. nnThe drinks specials were also delicious I came when Mamacitas were the special."
1,"Such a cute boutique! Located on the top floor of a small strip mall, this place has a ton of cute finds. They have items ranging from clothing, jewelry, decor, toys, stationary, etc. The prices range from inexpensive to expensive. I picked up a toy for my son and daughter that were very unique and cute. The only annoying thing was that I felt like I was interrupting the employees when I had questions. They were in the middle of wedding planning for the daughter of the owner and were very focused on that."
1,"Maizies is a great feature in the Central Phoenix landscape.  The food is top notch the insideout burgers are to die for, as is the skillet cookie for dessert and the service is pretty darn snazzy as well shout out to my favorite waitress Hannah!.  Proximity to the light rail is key.  My only qualm might be that parking is difficult.  And dont forget to check out  burgers on Mondays."
1,"Have eaten at the original location at least a dozen times, but never tried the shrimp fusion taco  until today. The shrimp quality is amazing, almost lobsterlike  not watery like cocktail shrimp. nnMy favorite house salsa is the bright red one with green onions in it. Perfect mediumhot heat. I put at least  ounce of it on each taco.nnReasonablypriced, and incredibly nice service. Not exactly a great date spot or a place to impress your inlaws  just creative, quality food served up with love. Nothing wrong with that!"
1,"we werent expecting a ton of fun, but it was surprisingly wellput together. a lot of fun and inexpensive  if you carry your student ID card. yes, I may have gradumacated but hey, its a rough economy out there.nntheres an inverse bell curve of age distribution  its young children, and their parents. so our bunch of something scienceengineering geeks from New York and New Jersey probably looked a little out of place.nnsome of the birds will come down and walk on the paths with you. that was cool. the bat cave was awesomely set up if disorienting, and the divebombing birds taking on the giant fish in the aquarium may have been my favorite part.nnI do agree with the post that says this place seems to be stuck in the s it has that designlook to it but they seem to have been taking care of it all along, so its not dilapidated. and yes, it is kidoriented, but also a GREAT spot for photography.nnyou can also purchase ticket packages for the BioDome and the Olympic Tower and some other sights, to save even more money. for a bunch of college students and recent college alumni, this was music to our ears.nntheir web site has an exhaustive database with information on all the lifeforms there, and webcams as well. I dont know if I would go back, since I dont think they change it very often, but for a first time thing in Montreal, its well worth it."
1,"It took for ever to get my food even though there was only two other people in the place, pet peeve.. BUT when the food finally got there I did not even care! It was so fresh! So good! if it was not so far I would be there every week, but for food this good I just might travel.. The brie and grape quesadilla..amazing! So if you go, lemme know I will tag along!"
1,"An elegant option while you are in Las Vegas, the Encore seems much more intimate than the next door Wynn.  Though you still get the normal influx of visitors ThuSun, no matter the time it seems like the Encore is much less crowded than the Wynn.  You still get to enjoy the Wynn amenities with the two being connected and just a short walk away, but if you are looking for a little less crowd and a little more elegance the Encore is the place to go.  Loved our stay and it has now turned in to our goto Vegas hotel  hands down."
1,"Scarpetta knows how to make a girl happy.  I went there this past Sunday for my very good friends birthday dinner. She said she had the spaghetti a year ago in Miami and has been dreaming about it ever since.  Now I know why!nBefore I get too far ahead of myself though, let me start at the beginning of my experience. My group was pretty large and scattered throughout the strip. A few of us were fashionably late but the hostess had no problem seating those of us who were there on time. Thats uncommon for shishi type places and I really appreciated it. The decor was a dark modern rustic allatthesame time type of feel. Very sexy place o Plus it overlooks the Bellagio fountains and the Strip! Nothing like enjoying a killer meal with that type of view. nThe sommelier was a delight. He helped us pick out a wine that had the qualities we wanted without breaking the bank. We thought it was hilarious when he said How about this vintage while pointing right at the price. Very classy way to help priceconcerned consumers wo announcing to the entire room that we were trying to save money.nA bread basket is usually of no consequence BUT, here, it was SOOOOO good! One roll in particular had prosciutto or salami wrapped in and it was amazing! Fresh, warm, and perfect!nWe shared a bunch of starters.  I got the yellowtail fully intending to share but that did not happen. It was so fresh and delicious with the shredded red onion on top that it somehow disappeared before I could send my plate around the table... OOPS!  I also managed to get a bite for my friends creamy polenta. To. Die. For. says it all.nNext, our main course   the spaghetti. Let me preface this by saying that  out the  people in our party ordered it because my friend hyped it up so much. We were not disappointed. I normally try to stay away from carbs and I seriously cannot remember the last time I went out and actually ordered spaghetti! It was just so good! It wasnt a heavy, flowery mess of wet spaghetti strands. It was light, tasty, cooked, and sauced to perfection. PS. it was great on its own  no meatballs or anything necessary to dress it up. That is a plate I would certainly order again. nIn sum, I had a great experience. I paid   for bread, pasta, some sashimi, and  glasses of wine and I still can say that it was well worth the price.  I would go back and definitely recommend Scarpetta  Vegas to friends!  o"
1,"Perfect spot for Sunday Brunch for Las Vegas locals! nnThe music makes you feel like you are at a party and the energy puts a smile on your face. For just , you can get allyoucandrink mimosas which is totally worth is considering one drink is ! nnThe menu doesnt include many traditional breakfast items which forces you to try something new! The chicken  waffles are to die for. I also enjoy the Jamaican pork hash and the Jamaican style omelet. The menu  sauces available are all Jamaican which you wont find anywhere else in Las Vegas!"
1,"Top Shelf is a term I would use to describe Donaldsons. I went in for the first time recently and was treated to patient, personal service in buying my first quality watch, and Dave was a champ to my family members and myself. A great selection for those with horological tendencies. This is the type of place you want to support locally. Highly recommended!"
1,"I absolutely LOVE Firefly. This was my first introduction to Tapas food and I havent looked back since. nThere are so many great things to say. Lets start with the Sangria. The servers often say theyre famous for their Sangrias, some of course are better than others and i usually recommend the sparkling, it literally drinks like juice! nAs far as the food goes its a smorgasbord of deliciousness!!! Im a huge fan of tapas because they offer me a little taste of everything so my taste buds are happy and the prices arent overly expensive. nTo any one going to Firefly for the first time I recommend the stuffed dates. They literally make my heart go pitter patter lol !!  Oh and dont forget the Nutella and banana sandwiches... Youll thank me later!"
1,We went on a Saturday night during the holidays.  Busy place after  pm.  Great wine list on an Ipad.  Small plates were shared by the group of .  Started  out with a cheese board of  cheeses.  Very good.  Next had chicken scewers and pork belly biscuit.  Finished with a flat bread pizza with shrimp and Andouille sausage.  Very filling even after sharing.  Quite pricy but a nice evening out.    . with tip.
1,Been to Bonfyre twice. Both times it was full but not crowded. All in our groups had a great experience. The food was delicious. Service struck the right balance by being very attentive but not overbearing. Atmosphere was inviting. We all look forward to going back in the future. Highly recommended!
1,"Aria is as good as it gets! nThe entire property is stunning. So different from anything else you will find on the Strip. nThe rooms are very luxurious. Best hotel bed that I have ever slept on! Nicely decorated. Spa like bathroom with a soaking tub. The remote system for the room was easy to use and was pretty darn cool. I read several peoples complaints about the system not working, and we did not have those issues.nCustomer service was wonderful. Front desk, housekeeping, security and the employees in various shops were all warm and welcoming. Check in was quick and our room was ready right away, we even had a great view of the Strip!nThe casino is dark, but we liked it. It also smells great in there, and is probably the least smoky casino in Vegas.. Big plus!nWhile we did not shop in Crystals the mall connected to Aria, it was fun to walk through. City Center is a refreshing change on the Vegas Strip. Even if you chose to stay elsewhere we never would! you have to spend some time there admiring all of the design and the buildings. Very cool place!"
1,"Man, I just love this place. Its become my goto comfort food over the last dozen years of coming here. Love the homemade flour tortillas, the chicken fajitas enough for  or lunch the next day, the pork tamales, the tortilla soup and the margaritas. The food has always tasted the same, the staff are the same faces year after year, and  the best part  I am never, ever rushed when Im here. Just sit down, relax, enjoy the complimentary chips and sip on your drink. When I need to unwind and let somebody else cook, this is my place."
1,I love this place. Im from LA and when ever we are in town we go there. The massages are always great and relaxing. The ambiance isnt that great or else I would give it  stars but they have definitely cleaned it up since we were there before. It was cluttered. But the place itself is very clean. And the prices are very reasonable especially considering how good the masseuses are.
1,"Friendly workers, but wish things were labeled better. The boba tea I got was not what I was expecting.  I asked for lavender and got a blended cinnamon cream shake with flavorless gummies at the bottom.nnDonuts were great, just wish flavors were labeled. I will be back, and be more careful with what I order"
1,"I got a snicker doodle, white chocolate macadamia nut ice cream sandwich with triple caramel. It was delicious! The cookies definitely made me want to write this review...and Im not a cookie person. Get the snicker doodle for sure! nn bucks! What a deal?!?!"
1,"We have been taking our  dogs there for over  years and couldnt be happier. When we pull into the parking lot, our dogs go crazy from excitement  they cannot wait to get into the door! Whether it is vet services, boarding, grooming, or just a doggie daycare day, the staff treats our dogs with such kindness and offers great customer service to us as pet owners."
1,"I love Mexican food. I once worked in a Mexican restaurant in Mexico. However, Montreal doesnt have a great variety of Mexican restaurants. A friend of mine who studied at Concordia told me about this place and I immediately wanted to try it. nnWe went around PM for a large snackearly dinner. The place was empty so we had a very large table just for us. However, Im sure that on Thursday night, the place is packed. The seats were very comfortable and the music was good. nnWe shared a plate of nachos and I had the chicken taquitos. Both are appetizers. The nachos were really delicious and spicy with the jalapenos peppers. There was plenty of cheese, salsa and cream cheese. Yummy. nnThere were  taquitos in my plate, about the size of cigars. They were good, but maybe a little dry. They came with a side of super spicy salsa and cream cheese. It was okay. nnWe shared the fried ice cream for dessert. They had a good selection of sauces. We chose chocolate. It was big, but just enough for the two of us. nnMy bill came about at  just for me. It was good, and much better than  amigos or Carlos  Pepes whose salsa has strawberries in it, by the way. nnIll definitely go back. Next time, Ill try the pork burritos, which my friend has strongly recommended."
1,"Ive been a fan of Chef Sheridan since his famous little shop inside the nail salon.  I was very much excited to learn that he finally opened again after being gone from the scene in a while.  Like what everyone else mentioned, this little gem is located inside Eureka Hotel.  Yes, the casino is smoky but trust me, once youre inside the restaurant, you wont even notice the smell anymore.  Plus, the walk from the casino to the restaurant is not very far.  nnOn this visit, I ordered the baos both types and they were delicious.  They werent as what I remembered them from The Great Bao, but delicious nonetheless.  I also ordered the fried pork noodle and I wasnt much of a fan.  However, Jenny Chefs wife, noticed I barely ate any of it, offered to remove it from our tab.  I told her ill just take it home but she insisted that if Im unhappy about it, she would be more than happy to take it back because she does not want me to have a substandard experience.  She also asked what I thought was bad about it so that she can inform the chefs and improve on it.  I loved that!  I love that theyre so attentive to their customers.  I was definitely impressed of their customer service."
1,"My  stars is based on service and ambience, not food  food would be a  star. nnOverall, the place was good and Id go back based on service and ambience, however the food was average at best based on the price point of what I ordered.   I ordered the east meets west  the tuna was good, but much fattier  stringy that Id expect and the halibut seemed to me that it may have been frozen recently or not thawed properly.  Anyway, good experience, hope the food is better next time"
1,"This place is amazing!  I came here with my brown boy, as he is so affectionately called, to grab a quick bite to eat after classes.  Still not sure why the boy invited me out to lunch if he wasnt hungry, but I was starving so I was down.  I ended up getting the something kafta and he got the spanakopita.  The food arrived promptly and the kafta was huge!  It came with two huge pieces of ground lamb, hummus, garlic sauce, and pita.  The spanakopita was also a huge for an appetizer.  I didnt have any of the spanakopita because I was so busy enjoying my meal.  The lamb was perfectly seasoned and was a great match for the addicting garlic sauce and the hummus.  Walked out of here paying less than .  Definitely a great meal at an amazing price!  I can see why its packed with college studentsnnIf you are getting dessert, I would skip over the jellied treats and go for the baklava.  Nothing can beat baklava."
1,"By far my favorite place for breakfast and brunch in Madison. Nothing compares to Lazy Janes in terms of price, quality or atmosphere. nnAtmosphere  old  story house turned into a restaurant. Seating on the st and nd floor. Old mix of tables, chairs and couches to sit on. Menu is on the wall, you order at the counter, and when your food is ready the kitchen hollers out your name and you pick up your own food at the window. nnStaff  friendly hipster staff that always has a good suggestion on food. I have yet to be steered wrong. nnCoffee  free refills at counter. Just walk up and they will take care of you. nnFood  i have yet to have anything bad here. They have good vegetarian and vegan options as well. My all time favorite dish there is the Biscuits and Gravy. Its probably the best biscuits and gravy north of the Mason Dixon line. What makes ti so good? Its those holy cow biscuits. nnDesserts  Get a half dozen scones to go. Try one of each flavor. They are out of this world. They are made fresh daily and are probably the best scones i have ever had. nnThank god the lazy undergrads refuse to come here for brunch. They are content with walking to Mickeys Dairy bar and we should all be happy about it, because if they ever discover this place en mass, the line will quadruple."
1,"Great great burgers. I thought the chicken burgers were just chicken breast with the sauce but apparently they are real chicken burgers, I have to try this sometime.nnIve had the bison and a regular burger there before please get a fried egg on top. The place has good ambiance and is great for going with groups.nnThe one thing with a place that is so great is that you should be prepared to wait, close to an hour to an hour and half.nnI always get the bourbon milkshake when I go there which is also quite tasty and filling.nnGo with an empty stomach and leave happy"
1,"Typical Starbucks located conveniently in Scottsdale Fashion Square Mall, decided to caffeinate its not a word, but it should be myself before shopping.nnPretty small location, but has plenty of outdoor seating in and out of the sun. Theres no indoor seating though! Ordered my typical Iced Caramel Macchiato and it came out in a timely manner. Really clean, stocked and filled with Starbucks goodies you can pick up."
1,"Just OK Mexican food. nnI had the  ceviches off the appetizers, the chips and salsa, and the tres leches cake. The ceviches were good except for the mahi one. The chips and salsa were really good and a great value for just  even though I think all Mexican restaurants should serve this for free. The tres leches cake was kind of disappointing. I love tres leches cake and I know how to make a very good one and this one was kind of dry and not as spongy as it should be. nnThe best part about this place is happy hour. Margaritas are  and well drinks are . Thats great for Vegas prices! Also, the location of this place is coolright by the cannel. nnIn other words, come for happy hour."
1,"I really dig this zoo.  I had a blast feeding the stingrays they are just like giant cuddly portabella mushrooms, i.e. AWESOME.  The open monkey exhibit is great too.  However, my favorite is the cabybara the largest rodent in the world.  My visit to the zoo is not complete without seeing the capybara in all of its sassy glory!nnI understand some folks uneasiness at zoos, worrying about the animals being too cramped, hot, etc.  But I really feel that the Phoenix Zoo is a far cry from the zoos and circuses of yore.  It is a nonprofit zoo, and it is important to know that it takes part in many conservation efforts and also serves as a sanctuary for unwantedaggressiveabused animals.  It is an excellent place to learn, especially for children."
1,"Great food, staff is unbelievably nice. Service  is top, no complaints there. FridaySaturday they have a Dj. Drinks and food specials are stupid good and they dont cut portions down. Hookah is good. Definitely a great stop for anyone just visiting!"
1,"Me likey!!  Lets be honest...I think the real reason I liked this place is because it felt like I was walking into my grandmas kitchen.  She is old school italian and has some of the same creepy black and white photos of random Italian families hanging on her walls...And her house has the aroma of garlic .  nnNo, seriously...I was impressed with Zio.  I dont eat Italian out very often because I prefer homemade sauce and pasta.  I am an Italian food snob because I come from an italian family...sorry, just being honest.  But, Zio was pretty decent.  nnI liked the atmosphere...as I described earlier..I expected grandma to walk out of the kitchen at any moment.  It is a low key, casual environment...which is great.nnI went with the basic angel hair and meat sauce with meatballs dish.  It was very good.  The sauce was a little tangy and maybe slightly too salty for my taste but it was good and homemade so I cant complain.  The meatball was very good as well.  It was also homemade and had a lot of flavor.  My dining partners tried the Penne Vodka and the Salmon Piccata and they were very impressed.  The vodka sauce was a little runny but it still had great flavor and a ton of fresh cut garlic so that was awesome. nnThe bread they serve with your meal was very good but I will say the herb infused olive oil was a bit bland.  We had to add salt and pepper so it didnt just taste like vegetable oil.  I am questioning if they ran out of olive oil and just served us something else.  Not sure...nnI hear the pizza is the way to go with Zio and I will definitely be back so that will be the next thing I try.  But, overall, I think it is a good, downhome, authenticish Italian restaurant here in Charlotte."
1,"I went here for a quick meal with a coworker. She swears by the breakfast at this place, but we were there for lunch. And I was not disappointed.nnThere is a fairly limited menu, but you can add and subtract ingredients, so there are lots of choices. I had the Natural burger, which was touted as being vegetarianfed steer beef, hormonefree and antibioticfree. It was a little pricier than my friends cheeseburger, but to quote Sam Jackson from Pulp Fiction, this is a tasty burger. I added bacon and cheese, and ditched the , Island. Nice combo. And I loved the soft potato roll that it came on. So far, so good.nnWe didnt order sides because the burgers were filling enough. And I am not a fan of Pepsi products, so I tossed my Diet Pepsi and got an iced tea instead. But from what I had, this place is going to be on my short list for burgers. And from what my friend told me, it might be on my short list for breakfast as well.nnAnd thank you, Farmer Boys, for listing the calorie counts on your menu board. Even though we all know a burger isnt the healthiest choice in the world, at least we can make a decision as to how much meaty goodness we want to ingest!"
1,"Great little place! The Manderin Shrimp is my favorite, I can eat  orders. The rolls have been quite pleasing as well. There are some very interesting ones to choose from. Fun to go in and try new things!!"
1,Had a lovely lunch with my friend. The Scallop roll is to die for! sushiwa is one of my favorite places to lunch in Newer henderson....it is so relaxing and the staff is friendly. The Sushi chefs are absolutely adorable!
1,"If Passorn actually were an actual angel it means angelic in Thai itd be cupid and itd have me right in the heart. Swoon. If I were feeling more poetic I would actually craft a sonnet in declaration of my newfound love for this Thai restaurant.nnIn a slightly innocuous spot between the heart of Bruntsfield, and the bustle of Tollcross, its not one youd easily wander by and its a bit off the eatinganddrinking Saturday night path. Its lack of close proximity to a few of my favourite bars almost made me book somewhere else. Oh how glad I am that my routine check of the menu online before booking made me pip for Passorn.nnIts a fairly small, intimate restaurant the dividing wall makes it feel that way and has a lovely, clean, elegant yet contemporary feel. When I arrived at pm on a Saturday night there were families with small kids wrapping up, couples on double dates, and myself with ma mere early Mothers Day treat. nnMy first, and finest, compliment goes to the staff. They were so attentive, so eager to please, always smiling, and so friendly that it really made the whole meal quite charmed. The food alone just you wait for the food was oustanding, but the staff ensured this is a sexy  stars from me.nnWhilst Id already prechosen mentally my meal via online, the specials menu had me at hello. So we ordered both daily specials. The king prawn, scallops, and monkfish and the guinea fowl with a side of rice, and noodles. nnOther reviewers have complained about the portion sizes. For me, it was perfect. Are we all so used to Italians that serve up three times the amount of pasta anyone should consume in one sitting that a reasonable portion is considered measly? I love to eat out but often lament that itll throw my get fit for summer plan out the window. I feel as though I could dine at Passorn on a weekly basis and never stray into sin. The sauces were light, but full of flavour, the meat so fresh and tender, and the sides just right. Id say you get far more noodles than rice if you do want to ensure youre full. But really, one main is the ideal size and perhaps one or two starters to share if you fancy.nnThe king prawns were served split in two still in their shell and the meat was bursting fresh from within. Like I said the sauce was light but so flavoursome. I cant really describe it. Slightly spicy, slightly sweet, all fresh. The guinea fowl sauce was particularly delicious and the bird very juice  too often game birds can be served a bit dry.nnI admit the half bottle of white wine I had which was really, really good btw. The Australian sauvignon I think tipped me to the side of ordering dessert. Banana fritters. Oh my. Not a trace of grease. I think it was even a breadcrumb type batter, scattered with sesame seeds. Not the small bit of banana consumed by greasy batter I was expecting and am used to. Huge chunks of banana, encased in a light, crisp, so thin its hardly there batter. Melt in the mouth and heavenly.nnOne thing my mum also commented on was the music. Think Bob Dylan, the Beatles the more obscure numbers too, like Martha My Dear and created a really nice ambience. Something a bit different to some restaurants that try to recreate true Thai with the tingly Thai music. I do sometimes find this distracting. Anyway.nnI cant vouch for the authenticity of this as far as Thai food goes. Far Eastern food is something I dont eat much, mainly because I find it hard to find good versions of it. My dilema is now solved with Passorn. My only concern is that I may not want to do my usual eat out somewhere new and just keep coming back. I kind of want to go again tonight... It was that good.nnOthers have also commented on prices.  Its not a cheap eats option, and I took my mum here for a Mothers Day treat early but I didnt think twice about the bill as the food was so outstanding. It didnt break the bank. In fact I found it to be just about right for a treat or maybe a nice date night meal  not too little, not too much. Heavenly."
1,"When it was called Gado Gado, I would drive by and think about stopping but not doing so.  What is a Gado and why are there two of them?  What kind of food would a Gado serve and would I like it?  Is it even a restaurant or is it some strange club where I would be abducted and turned into a Gado?? nnI drove by and saw it was Cafe  and stopped in for a drink.  I love repurposed spaces and this is a restaurant inside of an old bank.  The drive thru stalls are now home to a killer patio and the former bank atmosphere leads to a semidimly lit restaurant.  For a notso attractive guy like me, lower lighting works great as does temporary blindness FYI.  nnAt the bar, I met one of the owners and she told me that I was seriously overthinking the Gados.  In fact, they even reward their loyal customers with their names on the bar stools.  Yes, I like that!  The bar is positioned in a way as to not overwhelm the dining room and theres not a tv every foot as seems to be so popular in restaurants today probably to distract from the mediocre food.  nnAfter a few tasty drinks, I decided to partake in desert which was a chocolate cake.  It was so good that I later convinced another patron to get it as well.  nnGado, I mean Cafe  is definitely a place that look forward to returning and trying other items on their menu or just dropping by for a cocktail on the way home."
1,"Ive been going to You Need Nails since I moved to Phoenix. I have been here for about  months. I refuse to even try any other nail salon because I enjoy coming here and they do such a great job on my nails every time. They have such a great choice on color and designs. Every nail technician does a wonderful job too, so dont worry about who you get to do the job. Also the Pedicures are on point! I always get the Spa  with the wax. I high suggest trying it. So worth it!!"
1,"Ive eaten at Dom DeMarcos with friends and family on multiple occasions since they opened in Summerlin in early .  The Summerlin restaurant is divided almost in half between a large bar area with bistro style seating on the right and more traditional table seating on the left.  The bar side opens up to a large outdoor patio and fire pit.  The left side has an open style kitchen in the back where you can see the chiefs throwing the pizza dough in the air as they work the dough.  nnThe restaurant does more than pizza and the menu, although not that large, offers a good variety of appetizers, salads and pasta dishes.  One of my favorite appetizers is the bruschetta trio .  It comes with three pieces of garlic bread with one holding white beans, one with prosciutto and one with tomatoes, olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  They go well with a glass of wine from their reasonably large wine list.  Other notables are the fried calamari  and the antipasto plate containing, among other goodies, nice sharp pieces of parmesan reggiano cheese . They even have an appetizer of just meatballs, however, while the quality is good, it is way overpriced for what you get . The salads are huge, which seems to be a trend in restaurants these days.  If you get one, plan on sharing it or taking the rest home.  nnFor dinner, dont miss the pizza which comes in a thin small  or thick crust small .  You can start with plain cheese and add your own toppings or order from several suggested formulations.  If you go this later route, I recommend the white truffle pizza small  and large .  This beauty comes with mushrooms, mozzarella, parmesan, lots of garlic and truffle oil.  It is delicious. Aside from the pizza, Im also a fan of the prime rib sandwich . They tell you that they only make a limited supply of prime rib daily and when it runs out, the sandwich is no longer available that day however, Ive never had them tell me there wasnt any left. They serve it cold with a side of garlic fries and a horseradish aioli.  The meat melts in your mouth.  It would be perfect if they served it hot but thats why this sandwich also works well as a takeout item where you can heat it up at home.  nnThe desserts are the most disappointing menu items.  The tiramisu is small for the price and the cannoli taste like they are straight out of the freezer aisle of the nearest Costco.  Until they start to put the same attention into their desserts as they do with their food, I recommend you stick with a cup of coffee and have the dessert at home.nnThe atmosphere is lively and it can get crowded.  Even during the week, going there around  pm will require a wait for a table so plan ahead.  I give the restaurant four stars as they do a great job of bringing good quality Italian food to Summerlin."
1,"What a great place to just hang out and chill. Thoughtfully made cocktails and craft beers.nGreat music, cool events wonderful bartenders!nnnWhat more could you want?n  nnThe next time you are downtown you have got to stop in."
1,So I love cupcakes  I think it is because I dont have to committ to a full cake of a particular flavor.  BF can get one flavor and I can get another  then we can try eachothers.  Or as we did it here  get four different flavors and have a cupcake a day for two days. nnThese cupcakes are amazing! Here is the general review nn. I had a vanilla with chocolate frosting  it was ok  I would give this cupcake three stars.  The vanilla cake needed more flavor to it. nn. The triple chocolate  BF says it was very good and very chocolate. nn. Pink Cadillac  sooooo good  Serious five star cupcake! nn. The Baked Apple So delicious and genius  apple struesel on the bottom!! nnOverall these were very moist and some of the best in the valley.  Just wish they had a different location  right in front of the kids play zone in the Arrowhead mall a little chaotic  very loud  and not the best place to enjoy a tasty treat!
1,I put one heck of a scratch in the side of my boyfriends car. I thought Iveys Yelp review was a little too good to be true but I took the car there anyway. The minute I pulled in Mr. Ivey was there to help me. He wasnt sure how deep the scratch was but he offered to buff it for me just to see what could be done. He spent  minutes buffing the scratch and it was like it was never there. When I asked him how much for the service he told me it was free. I offered to at least pay him for his time since I didnt have an appointment and was taking away from paying costumers. He wouldnt even let me do that. He just asked I remember him if I got in an accident. Iveys quality of work is superb and I can recommend him wihtout hesitation.
1,"I met one of my friends who had been to the Dive Bar a few times for dinner one evening after work.  We were able to quickly and easily find seats, although Im sure when its really busy, it can be frustrating!nnWe ordered the Tuscan Spinach  Artichoke Dip appetizer which was fantastic!  Well, it was great  but needed a little extra salt or seasoning, but still great!  nnThe menu is pretty decent sized and we had a hard time deciding what to eat, but both went with Quesadillas Crazydillas! and had decided to share.  nnMy friend got the Loaded Pierogie and I got the Southern Comfort.  We both agreed that the loaded pierogie was  Ok.  Nothing to write home about.  It was actually pretty bland.  But, we both devoured the Southern Comfort Quesadilla!  It was phenominal.  I will definately order this again!  nnCheck it out, give it a chance!  Its a great place with a great beer selection!"
1,"Jan was amazing tonight, my wife came with me on this trip, and we love a good magician, and Jan and his team really delivered. The best part was how close were to the stage. It as really fun, all the dancers looked like they were having fun, and they had achieved a fun ensemble cast feel... I will be back and will bring business associates as well. Stephen W Smith"
1,"Well in the land of Buffets this isnt the very best or the cheapest but they are in the top with me.  They get a lot of points with because they serve Pho ok its not the best but it has fresh broth and noodles and the overall quality of the food is very good plus the shear variety pleases me to no end nnPositivesnThe kitchens of each of the food types are open to view.nDecor is lovely, modern and has a variety of decorations.nTons of variety Sandwich bar, Asian Noodle  Dim Sum, Japanese, Italian, Chinese, American, Mexican, BBQ, desert, Omelet Station, peel and eat shrimp, and so on.nnNegativesnIts a buffet  as much as I love them they can be very impersonal.nnI have been here a couple times and I do enjoy it but like any Buffet they do have some inconsistencies with food quality  some items amazing and some, well, sucky.  They are a safe bet though and I will go again!"
1,I love this place!!! The restaurants have been upgraded from the last time i was here. The staff are amazing. Its super clean. The shuttle is located in the back of the hotel!!!!! Its centralized on the strip. The slots are a little looser.
1,"What a fun and affordable hotel in downtown Phoenix! The beds and linens were nice, a pretty view of the city and a lovely rooftop swimming pool. If you like historic hotels with ghost stories youll love it here. So many restaurants and nightclubs to walk to and its right next to the light rail. Also, a lot of celebrities stayed here back in the day including Marilyn  Elvis. The air conditioning was also nice which was great since its so hot outside."
1,"Bouchon is one of my alltime favorite restaurants. Top  for sure. The food is exceptional. I order something different every time and Im blown away every time. The charcuterie platter is delicious and the salmon rillette is ridiculously good. We tried the bone marrow last time and it was awesome. I had the New York steak with potato gratin and my girlfriend had the veal tenderloin. Both were fantastic. Throw in a couple Grey Goose martinis with blue cheese stuffed olives and a waiter with a good personality and attention to detail and we had a dinner to remember. Definitely worth the price. Im looking forward to going to Napa to try out the Bouchon there, as well as Kellers other restaurant, French Laundry."
1,"Coup des Tarte delivers exactly what its name suggests, a ravishing blow to the palette that storms your mouth by force and takes no prisoners.  The chocolate and caramel fleur de sel tart is a testament to the aphrodisiac quality of fine food, and it had me moaning at the table heedless of surrounding company, who conveniently were also moaning with pleasure after sampling the four berry tart with vanilla gelato, so at least I was in good company. nnThe small converted house lends a homey, romantic feel with wood floors, soft curtained windows for natural light and warm walls that were decorated with a discerning eye for color.  The tables are small and a bit crowded, but are not close enough that you will end up distracted by surrounding conversation.  It is most assuredly not a place to bring a large group of people, with a count of four being about the max for a comfortably seated party.nnOne thing I adore is that its BYOB, which is a blessing because their menu is pricey enough as it is without tacking on the inevitable, exorbitant price of alcohol.  Instead they charge a nine dollar corking fee and provide all the necessary accoutrement for opening and chilling your selection during the meal. nnThe appetizers are consistently delicious.  The three onion tart in particular is the perfect balance of sweet and smoky, with the tart crust and caramelized onions playing up the sweet side, and the smoky bacon with Gruyere cheese satisfying the savory.  It is an honest to goodness coup des tarte in your mouth, as has already been discussed.  The chevre cheese and tomato appetizer and country pate plate were also rich and savory, the walnut bread with the pate being particularly notable, although they lacked the complexity of the three onion tart and seemed much more savory. nnThe entrees were perhaps the weakest portion of the meal, which was surprising considering theyre naturally the most expensive.  The duck breast was cooked to perfection and wasnt too fatty, and the honey, lavender, rhubarb sauce was a beautiful compliment to the meat.  The accompanying green beans and mashed potatoes fell far short of the duck though, and could have used a more creative interpretation.  The Moroccan lamb shank with Israeli couscous and chickpeas, however, was off the charts delicious!  It was fall of the bone tender and all the components of the meal were highly complimentary.  The sea bass Ive had on previous visits also suffered the same fate as the duck, with an ultimately well prepared and scrumptious protein accompanied by lack luster sides. nnBut ultimately it is the dessert course that is the crowing jewel of this establishment. Dont say, Well I never order dessert. Or But Im watching my weight.  Believe me, you want these perfectly prepared, sweet and salty concoctions to make love to your mouth.  Every tart I have ever tasted has elicited the same sleepy smiles of contentment and pleasurable moans.  In fact, it might even be a better investment to go a nontraditional route and just skip right from the appetizers to the dessert course.  That way you can order several varieties and indulge in blissful, sugary enjoyment."
1,"Yelp  Challenge  Las Vegas Adventures The Hunt for CoffeennMy husband is a coffee fanatic and is a big fan of Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf. Since we werent familiar with the Las Vegas area, I yelped the nearest coffee joints around our vacation rental instead of hunting for Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf.nnEnters in Human BeannnWhile my husband was playing pool in the den area, I  read aloud the reviews to my husband suggesting that we sneak away since the rest of the household were still asleep! Yes, parents with young adults do sneak away because they will end up ordering for everyone on our own money!nnLocation Easy to find on Fort Apache! Remember those little houses in the parking lot that you used to drop off your camera film Note This is only for people who were born before the s to develop? Well, Human Bean is located in a little house in the middle of a parking lot AND you drive up to place your order.nnService EXCELLENT. The baristas or should I say window ladies? were very friendly as we gave our order AND they also gave a candy coffee bean on top of the coffee. The lids are pretty neat because it had a little open and close lever to prevent any spilling as you drive I can see why because the speed limit was higher here than Hawaii!.nnMenu Pretty interesting because of the different names and types of coffee or beverage they serve. I wanted to try the MexiMocha but I never got the chance to return here nnPrice Your typical coffee and tea prices.nnRecommendation HIGH RECOMMENDATION if you are looking to branch away from Starbucks or other Coffee establishments.nnNevertheless, my husband was satisfied as we drove on because I located a Jamba Juice that was  miles down the road when lo and behold...there was a grand opening of a Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf right next to the Jamba Juice. But, that is another story.nnA Very Random Thought Who uses GPS? I will only use a Tom Tom and no other because the one that my husband attempted to use while on vacation was irritating since we would drive past the Freeway cutoff and had to do a Uturn!Thus, my going back to Google Maps and doing it the old fashioned way of looking for a restaurant, store, or community centers."
1,"I am convinced that there are certain cursed locations in Las Vegas, this being one of them. No matter what goes up in these areas of town, they are replaced just as quickly. Perhaps all the Starbucks makes it difficult to stay in business, because the customer service is spot on. Is this the second or third coffee shop to open at this site?nnThe employees here are wonderful. When I went in to ask for more ice in my passion fruit ice tea, I also got a top off with more of the fresh brewed stuff.  Also stole a few sips of a friends coconut mocha ice blended and it was delicious. It is not as sugary as a frappacinno, but there is no pretending that you cannot taste the fatty goodness. They also have Italian style drinking chocolate, I will wait until the winter to get that, because a thick, hot drink does not sound pleasant right now."
1,Great costumer service! First time getting a massage and I loved it! My husband and I got the couples massage and it was great! They make you feel special and the water they offer you is good definitely recommend this place.
1,"It is too bad I can only give  stars for Tempe Trophy! I had a single aluminum clipboard on which I wanted a logo and text engraved.  I emailed several Phoenix area trophy shops with my request and Connie got right back to me saying they could do it but she recommended doing sand blasting.nnConnie quoted a price that blew all other shops out of the water... they werent even CLOSE.  And, for the quality of the work, it was better than I had hoped.  Paying x at another shop could not have created a better end product.  They were quick too less than a week.nnI will take all of my engraving needs to Tempe Trophy and recommend you do as well."
1,Amazing...simply amazing. Possibly the best show I have seen in Vegas. One hour and  minutes of awe inspiring lighting and choreography. I had heard from many people that this was the best of the Cirque shows and I believe it. Not a bad seat in the house theater in the round. We were about  rows up from the front in section B. I highly recommend this show.
1,"Very pleased with our stay! We only needed one night and the staff was able to accommodate us well at a great rate! nnThe bed was incredibly comfortable and the shower was to die for! I literally stayed in the shower for almost  minutes because it was THAT amazing! The room was very cozy and quiet. nnThe only downfall was that I didnt like how we were treated the next day. Check out isnt until am and at , housekeeping came in to clean the room. We told them we were finishing getting ready and packing and would be out by . At , the managerfront desk worker came to our door asking if we were leaving now. Um.. Excuse me...I have to have someone come to my door to ask us to leave even though its not even check out time?nnI enjoyed the hotel and will be back, but there is no need to knock on the customers door to ask them to leave. Not sure if it was because we got a good rate for the night or what but that was the only turn off."
1,"i feel bad for those that didnt get the good experience.  i was there w a bunch of guys so we mingled at the bar before we got seated.  if you want to a nice quiet romantic date dont come here because your eyes and ears will be occupied by music, tv, and lights.  once our table was ready the waiter greeted us and placed wings on our plates.  we sat and started to grub on our free wings... boy was it good!  they only offer a verbal menu so you have to pay close attention to what the waiter says.  ok, make sure you order their philly cheesesteak appetizer cuz its freakin awesome!  that thing seriously melts in your mouth.  i ordered their lobster thing w risotto and again.. super yummy.  their portions are HUGE so make sure you go on a empty stomach.  chef martorano was there that nite so it was coo to see him in action.  i dunno why people are hating on the location just cuz its at the rio... it might look ghetto but my room was awesome.  maybe they were staying at the cheap towers.  have fun at cafe martorano!"
1,"BEST teppanyaki experience EVER.  EVERRRRRRR!!!nnive been to so many teppan places in hawaiiikobe steakhouse, tanaka of tokyo, benihana none of them can even come close to my time at musashi.  not only was the chef super entertaining, but the food was SOOOOOO good.  nnill start with the chefhis name is tsutomu.  SO entertaining, SO hilarious, SO fast with that knife and two prong fork, did i mention SO entertaining?  i seriously had the teppan time of my life.  i dont think ive ever had a chef that made me laugh so much and dub me a new name mercedes.  AND told a dirty story about rabbits using the shrimp.  AAAAND busted out so many kinky knickknacks and toys.  it is definitely recommended that you ask for him.nnnow, the foodi felt like i got so much more food at this place than any other.  and so many different sauces too!  i swear there were at least  different ones.  garlic, spicy, sweet, ginger, mustard, aioli, etc.  i was so amazed!  my favorite has got to be the garlic one since i LOVE garlic.  i also enjoyed the fact that strips of potato were included in the meal.  i think i liked that the most.  i ordered the katana special which consisted of chicken and shrimp.  sooooo yummy.  i also had a bite of my friends steak which he drizzled with lime something i had never seen.  surprisingly, it was really tasty!  i ate a little bit of the lobster fried rice too and as much as i dont care for lobster, it was pretty effin great.  but of course, my faaaaaave was the dessert.  tempura ice cream! need i say more???nnthe next time i go back to vegas, im def hitting up musashi and tsutomu again!!! nnp.s. their sushi is pretty good too! try it!np.p.s. service is awesome too"
1,"The new Joint is great. Because of the layout and new sound it tops the Pearl for best mid sized venue.  The old Joint I loved the layout but the sound was awful!  The new Joint the sound is great, same great layout only larger. They even have reserved seats for the people that dont truly like the concert experience. To me a venue should be  or more  general admission otherwise its a total corporate experience and not built for true music and concert fans.  Great sounds, good promotion with Live Nation. Happy they got rid of Andrew Hewitt, he robs fans on ticket prices and the bands dont get any more money.  I only wish the Hard Rock would get a better parking garage for when concerts get out. That or  a larger valet area."
1,I have been hooked on this place since my first haircut there. A quality cut with a scalp massage and I never had to wait. The place is very clean and professional. The women barbers are very beautiful especially Reyna who cuts my hair. I highly recommend a visit.
1,Theyre open hrs so its great for us late night casino people.  The bulgogi is probably the best Ive tasted so far in town.  I always mean to try other things but alway keep coming back for that.  Its a little more expensive than the other places in town but the hours and availability make up for it.  Service is less than spectacular but Im used to it.
1,"First time I tried this new snow ice dessert. I actually hadnt heard about it until just recently. Just moved here from Seattle so must be a new trend. I ordered the coconut delight and it was really good. I also had a bite of the black sesame which was also very delish. The texture of it is exactly like it sounds .. like snow! They use condensed milk to sweeten things up and add toppings as you like. Very good stuff, but not so sure it beats my beloved froyo."
1,"the th star is for the fact that theyre open hrs and im usually a fan of eateries open hrs. apparently, this is an extension of The Cheesecake Factory. it was good and the service here is great, i love when the manager walks around and has a conversation with his customers. even the hostess was incredibly friendly and conversational. thats important.nnif youre in Vegas, definitely check this place out for a late night meal"
1,"Its been over a year since I was here and promised to leave a review. Why wait that long?  nnOne benefit is that I can say that the work done has stood the test of time and other than the title it would be hard for someone not very well versed in used cars to tell it was ever in an accident. nnThe process of working with LG was very good with  some phone tag, but not excessively so. There were complications from the kind of accident it was and insurance companies involvment that caused delays  plus the difficulty of getting parts from Japan at the time made it hard to get a handle on how long it would take for me to rent a car for.   In the end they helped me out on the deductible as their site says and a few days car rental so It was fair. nn Id be more than happy to take a car back here should the need arise and Im pretty sure youll be  in the  star range when you do.    For me ."
1,"Came around am. Our waitress was Ashley. After one of the other folks finished taking our drink orders, Ashley returned to take our food order. She was polite and very attentive. After she left in just a few minutes she returned slightly flustered and very honestly told us she had accidentally thrown our ticket away. After retaking our order she left and returned with two muffins. My wife asked why the muffin as she was not to get one. She smiled and reminded us it was for her gaffe regarding our ticket. She left and we chuckled about her being so concerned for forgetting knowing wed probably forget where we parked our car until we left. Anyway breakfast was awesome and actually the order wasnt any longer to our table than normal. No thanks to Ashley. She also comped our drinks which she didnt need to do but again I think for the error. Its nice she had both the courage and obvious pride in her work to simply be honest. Taking full responsibility for anything today especially in a restaurant is rare. Well return again for sure no doubt because of food but mostly because of service! Well done Ashley! Now pack your bags and get on that plane...youre going to Disney!!"
1,"Awesome BBQ ribs with amazingly hot hot sauce!  You can share the largest size and on Tuesday night they are  of for ..  The beans, slaw, corn and cornbread are great also!  Service has also been awesome two times now.nWayne Gorsek"
1,"Coming here is cheap entertainment.  The store is big and stocks tons of foods from all over the world.  They even have some green teamangored bean ice cream.  The back section is mostly frozen fishanimals various fish, anchovies, snails, whole chickens, octopus, squid, CUTTLEFISH?.  They even have a big pile of Durian, along with several kinds of Durianflavored wafers with their own typed disclaimer that says something along the lines of, Yes, the wafers are supposed to smell like that.nnI make the trip mostly for the selection of Mexican food and sweets.  They have many kinds of Mexican candy, along with canned goods you cant find in regular grocery stores.  Everything is cheap, cheap, cheap and never expired.nnEvery time Ive gone the cashiers have been kind, or at least civil.  They get you in and out and on your way quickly.  Seems they have even started taking credit or debit cards now.nnGo check it out, buy some foreign candy, and gawk at the durian and cuttlefish.  Its really worth the trip."
1,"I love this place and I would recommend everyone to go here! All of the employees are amazing and really nice. They go over every detail and answer any questions that you have. They have teeth whitening, facials, massages, tanning, hydration and a ton of extra goodies to choose from. The packages are very reasonable and worth every penny. I think the best part is I have been coming here once a week for about six months now and I have not had one bad experience."
1,"Open hrs, Senor Taco Famous for the Shrimp Burrito is a must stop.nnThe Diablo shrimp burrito is to die for, Lunch or Dinner. Ham  Cheese Quesadillas for breakfast are great Ask them to mix in a few Jalapenos with the ham.nnAll my friends drool whenever they come over cause they want to stop."
1,"Generally, I like it. I think I would enjoy this more as an afternoon bar than a night bar, though. Something about playing a lazy Sunday game of SkeeBall appeals to me more than trying to fight through the crowds for a turn at Jenga. But thats just me.nnOne thing that always bugged me about these arcades for adults is that they seem to focus too much on the arcade and not nearly enough on the food and beer. Sure DBs has every game you can imagine, but youre stuck carrying a  Miller Lite around while you play them. Im happy to say that I think Blind Pig has found the proper balance, with the right amount and variety of games and good craft beer to back it up."
1,This is my top  favorite buffet at Vegas... My friend introduce this place to me years ago and I have came here more than  times ...... Great place with lots of selecting on sushi sashimi and cut roll. Oyster is always good and uni sushi is excellent!
1,"Love it! Best  and possibly only  coffee shop where you can get a spicy chai latte in the east valley. The barista, who is almost always the same guy whenever I stop in there, is very friendly, helpful and knowledgeable about what he does."
1,"I had a sprinkler that was gushing... pipe broken way below ground, it turned out.  I read such good reviews about Ryan and Vegas Valley Lawn Care on Yelp, that I called them to have it fixed.  Their work was great, and they were great to deal with.  So Ill join their many fans and highly recommend them.  Louise R."
1,"We saw the restaurant on TV. Otherwise we would have never known about it. So, while vacationing in Vegas we decided to give it a try we were there on August , . Its modest, clean, pretty inside, and the staff were very down to earth, professional, and informative. Great so far, but what about the food???? Well, thats the big reason to visit Parma! We all had a different sandwich we were there for lunch, and all  were GREAT! nnCasual feel, GREAT food, local feel, quiet and off the strip, and family friendly. And since they have a deli too, you can get all of those specialty meats and cheeses, etc to take with you! GREAT job PARMA!"
1,"My family and I drove here from Green Valley , there was a line up and it moved fast . The staff was very friendly and the waitress came around several times and replenished drinks just as quickly. The fried chicken was awesome and the sirloin steak very good. Good salads and the roast beef was very tender. The desert bar was excellent . Its a nice family orientated place away from the casinos for the locals . The restaurant is big , good parking and bright .  Some people have made disparaging comments about the area  and that is unfortunate .  I hope they are a success and open a few more around town."
1,"The Lodge has what every one is looking for in a bar in Scottsdale  good bar food, sports on the TVs, comfy booths, a pool table, unassuming interior, etc.  Walking in the front door, past the  huge wood carved bigfoot and a small one, lies the interior of a quentissential backwoods lodge.  Antlers for chandeliers  check, barstools made of solid wood  check, split wood walls  check, moose on the fireplace  check, yes, you are in for a good night out at The Lodge."
1,This is the best Outback location in the area.  The food is always tasty but more importantly the service is always great.  I come here about once a month and havent had a bad experience yet.  The sirloin and crab legs are my favorite.  Protip  If you like your steak medium rare order it medium.  They consistently under cook.
1,"The food is not the best, but the phosphate fizzies are out of this world. The oldfashioned soda fountain reminds of when my gramps used to bring me here after gymnastics. It was our special Saturday date. The music supports the vintage theme and the thrift store is always stocked with rare finds.nnEat lunch elsewhere but stop in for a fizzy, you can thank me later."
1,"I havent been to Flemings for at least  years. The last time was in California at the Newport Beach location. It was a week before my birthday, and I still havent decided where I wanted to eat dinner that night. At first I thought, maybe Ill look at restaurants on the strip. Then I told myself, on a Saturday? Hell no! Yes, I am one of those locals who avoid going to the strip as much as possible lol. I thought about Flemings and how I have never ate at this location, so I decided to make a reservation here. nnThe first thing I noticed when we drove in was the valet. Seriously, does anyone else agree that the valet here is pointless? There are parking stalls very close to the restaurant and you dont have to walk far. Anyway, our reservation was at pm and we arrived about  minutes early so we decided to sit at the bar. They had iPad menus which you could use to browse the wine list and food options, which was pretty awesome. The bartender was friendly. She chatted with us for a bit and made us feel welcomed.nnWe were seated right at . The hostess asked us if we preferred black napkins because some people dont like the lint from the white napkins getting on their dark clothes. This was the first time I was given a napkin color option at a restaurant. We told her that the white ones were fine. The food was just as good as I remembered. I ordered the Petite Filet Mignon. Yes, its a pretty small steak, but I like to leave room for some sides and of course dessert for my birthday! My steak was cooked to perfection  mouth watering, easy to cut, juicy and full of flavor! I ordered a baked potato as my side because their Chipotle Cheddar Mac  Cheese had scallions in it that were premixed.  Sorry, not a fan of onions, scallions, chives, etc. My husband enjoyed his Main Filet Mignon as well. He also ordered the grilled asparagus as a side, but didnt like the taste of it. For dessert, we got the Chocolate Lava Cake, which is always very delicious! It is a little rich, so its perfect for sharing.nn minutes into our meal, we looked over at the bar, and it was packed! Happy Hour here at Flemings must be very popular! They should really consider expanding the bar area to accommodate the large crowd. Service was very attentive and excellent. The manager even stopped by our table to wish me a happy birthday. At the end of our meal, our server gave me a complimentary box of truffles as my birthday treat. How nice! nnThis place isnt cheap, but it was worth the money. I would definitely come back again in the future for a special occasion!"
1,"This, along side of its big brother next door, are the best restaurants in Vegas. The food is mind blowing. Service is as good as it gets. The atmosphere is top notch. nnOne thing about the menu. Everything is good. But if you want to taste the worlds greatest mashed potatoes, you will find them there. nnIf you hit it big and have enough extra money in your pocket to either buy used Kia or have dinner, treat yourself and go here. Its insanely expensive. If you are a foodie like me, it is well worth it. Does not get much better than this."
1,"After the first time I ate here, Im an instant fan!nnTheir lunch specials are pretty awesome! For . you get a choice of entree, egg drop soup, a chicken wing and an egg roll. The entree choices have the popular thai dishes  curry, pad thai, panang, thai bbq chicken and also a bunch of chinese food entrees  ginger chicken, chow mein, beef broccoli. nnI always crave their green chicken curry!! The last time, I thought I could handle a level  spicyness but it was soooo spicy! I usually can handle spicy food, but that was SPICAAAY! The next time I think I will get a level .nnThe staff are very nice and service is excellent. They sometimes have live music. Usually at night time. Very big space and a lot of seating areas. nnTheir takeout service is great too! A definite fave of mine! Im so glad they are located  mins away!"
1,I rescued Maggie from a very neglectful situation and when I got her home I didnt realize the amount of trauma she had.  She was anxious and afraid of everything and everyone.  I didnt think she would ever be normal.  Jimi not only helped me with her commands but he also fixed her fear issues.  Thank you for everything!!!
1,"We went here last night for my boyfriends birthday. Made a reservation the same day and I asked the lady who took the reservation if she can personalize the menu for him and have his name on it  something I saw on a previous review. She told me she can work on it but the reservation was last minute, and shell do her best. I wasnt expecting anything but it was nice of her to try. nnTo my surprise when we got there they had the personalized menu greeting him happy birthday. nnOur server was very pleasant and gave us some great suggestions on the wine. We got a nice bottle of cabernet. We ordered the calamari and rock shrimp for appetizer. We got the  oz Tomahawk ribeye and garlic mash potatoes. nnThe appetizer was ok, more salty than I would like and the shrimp tasted weird. The steak was delicious, it had that nice grill taste and a demiglaze that was not too overwhelming for the steak. It was a very big portion that we had left overs. The garlic mash potatoes were also very good. nnAs a bonus they brought us out a toffee dessert thing for his birthday. nnThe service here is amazing. Starting with personalized menu, the dessert, and then they even gave him a card to wish a happy birthday.nnIts off the strip located at the Renaissance. Very nice hotel. I highly recommend this place!!"
1,"For  years I have loved everything about this place.  It is always GREAT, from the food to the beer to the service.  The dedication to this craft for  years takes a very special crew of people.  I Love this place."
1,"Only went here once about a year and a half ago, but they had great pancakes! My only problem with it at the time was that they allowed smoking, so I left smelling like a cigarette. With the change in law, Im sure the atmosphere has improved!"
1,"Two walls of mirrors.  Enough said.  Makes for a very interesting weekend.  Add in floortoceiling windows, and the Vegas experience is just about complete.  nnThe rooms are gorgeous.  The bed is comfortable, theres a TV in the bathroom that you can watch while taking a bath, the living area is spacious...I absolutely LOVED the room.  Based on this alone, I would give the hotel five stars.  nnBUTnnFor a room this pricey over  a night on Expedia, Id expect better sound proofing.  I could hear peoples conversations while they were walking down the hallways and in adjacent rooms even rooms above ours.  I didnt expect so much sound transfer.  Plus, you can hear XS going on all night through the window wall.  There was just a lot of noise.  The toilet in the bathroom sounded like it was exploding every time it was flushed, and you could similarly hear this through two bathroom doors into the living space.  nnWe were given two card keys, and one didnt work.  Also, we had trouble operating the shades and drapes.  Sometimes they worked, and sometimes they didnt and needed some fiddling.  nnWe were left a message saying there was a cake delivery for my birthday.  We made sure to turn off the privacy  button, and we waited for going on two hours and no one arrived.  The next day, we were told that our privacy light was on, which was bull, because we specifically made sure it was off.nnIts still a nice hotel.  I just wish there werent all these little glitches during our stay."
1,"WOB is a pretty cool place. I live really close by so for convenience purposes, its a great place to kick back and have a few beers. The beer selection, as expected is outstanding and the staff is really friendly. I have just recently started expanding my beer pallet so Im always looking for recommendations and suggestions on different beers, and the staff is usually able to point me in the right direction. nnThe prices are a little high for a beer generally about  bucks a piece so I try not to come here too often and the fact that they dont have any food is a little disappointing but I guess if youre a beer lover, this is the place to be."
1,"This is one of my favorite places to go!  I have never been disappointed by the quality of the food and the presentation is fantastic!  Only downsides are  You may have to wait for quite a while if you go at peak times, the prices look a bit steep though you get soo much food that it is worth it, and it is noisy.  Though all of those are not really downsides in my mind, I would still wait  if I happened to have a craving for a Snickers pancake on a Sunday morning! DnnRecommendations  Watermelon kiwi lemonade, Snickers pancake, Meatloaf...  Everything I have tried so far has been amazing! D"
1,"Yum! By far my fave yogurt in AZ!nnI dig the super healthy, fatfree and sugar free options that you cant always find at some of the other dispense your own fro yo places. I also like that they have flavors Ive never heard of ie Macai which I think is a berry found in Chile that has like superdooper antioxidant benefits, like more than acai. Toppings are fresh and there are oodles of fruit options. My only hang up is that its really hard to get around in there. If you want to sample flavors you have to sort of bob and weave in and out of folks who are dispensing with little room to groove. Im sure there is an etiquette Im missing, but like a kid in a candy store, I just plunge in there and get going. nnKnow Before You Go Its always busy. Every time Ive been there. Always."
1,"Yes, this place is impressive. Chicago style thin pizza no deep dish that is very, very good. Crispy and chewy crust, great sausage, sliced into squares. Best pizza Ive had in awhile.nnAs a fan of Chicago pizza my inlaws are from the Windy City I always stick with limited toppings, one of which must be sausage. This time out, we did sausage and spinach, and it was awesome. The spinach is mamas recipe, where theres a secret ingredient. The secret ingredient is garlic. Lots of garlic  and thats a good thing.nnThis place is tucked away into an industrial park, so it can be hard to find. Its also rather small, and can get quite crowded. Expect a wait during busy periods. Its also BYOB."
1,"Willy wonka would stop by this donut shop. Maybe not the one played by Johnny Depp but the older one played by Gene Wilder. The only thing that could make this place a ten star place is if they had umpa lumpas work the donut shop.nThe place has so many different glazes and a plethora of toppings, which makes the combinations of donuts endless. They have cherry, mint, chocolate, salted caramel, blueberry, chocolate chips, maple, even bacon!!!!! So once you figure out the type of donuts you want, you can watch the freshly made donuts make their way on the conveyor belt. The donuts are picked up and placed in the glazes of your choose and then the toppings are put on all right in front of your eyes. Yum yum!"
1,"If it hasnt been hammered into you already, the portions can probably feed an army.nnThings that Ive had so far arennBacon, avocado, and cheddar burger its quite scary to look at.  But it was amazing.  I suppose if you love bacon, avocado, and cheddar cheese, it would be like the best thing ever.  nnSausage biscuit and gravy pot pie Yeah, I ate this over the course of  days.  It was amazing.  The pie part is shaped kinda like a straw hat. The first time I had it, the whole thing was like super crunchy.  The nd time I had it, it was crunchy on the outside rim, but softish on the middle.  I think I like that change.nnSage fried chicken Omg, was like massive.  This was actually my first dish here ever, and it was when it just opened.  Unfortunately at the time circa Fall , the chicken seemed a little dry.  Other people with later reviews have stated that it was better, so probably worth trusting their reviews if theyve improvednnHouse smoked salmon hash pretty good.  It actually seemed to be one of their smaller dishes.nnRoasted chicken, garlic, onions, etc. hash yea, this was pretty good too.  This time the chicken was fairly tender.nnThe Kokomo Let me just say that this one terrifying sandwich.  Its a huge slab of some meatsausage loaf on two texas toast with melted cheese and sundried tomato thats been soaked and sliced.  Absolutely deliciousnnMashed potatoes with bacon and cheddar Its basically mashed potatoes with bacon and grilled cheddar on top.  Its not mixed in, like I thought it would be.nnA bit of advice if you go with some people, figure out if you want to split  or not.  If you do, you wont have to take home leftovers.  They do charge . to split a plate, so order some side that you wanna eat thats cheap or you can take home to reheat, and theyll waive the . split plate charge.  Alternatively, you could pick foods that dont have something crispy that you wont have to worry about getting soggy when you reheat and just take that home."
1,"Maggianos never fails good food, good service, and the familystyle serving makes for a great night out with friends or, well, family. Every time Ive been out to eat at this location, I end up talking to someone new. Megan V. mentioned talking to folks at a table near her own, which has been my experience as well. Normally, I can be kind of a snot about talking with strangers, but somehow the vibe in Maggianos makes it ok. Its a good thing.nnThe staff is fast and friendly, and the prices arent bad considering the quality of the food."
1,"So what more can I say about Swish as I go way back to when the previous location on Sahara and Buffalo was the place to go for Shabu Shabu and Sukiyaki. My brother and I had the great opportunity to go to the new Chinatown location last weekend and my hats off to Phil because the food is even better now. The Crispy Garlic Chicken and Sassy Calamari appetizers were a delicious way to start and the Kobe Chuck in both ways of cooking was the best meal we had bar none during our stay in Sin City. You cant argue the bang for the prices and if you enjoy spicy, go with the Spicy Salmon Salad... I could eat that all day! We went during lunch hours and our waitress Hazuki did a great job taking care of us. Great food, great service.. and now its closer to the Strip. Definitely go check it out folks.. you wont regret it"
1,I enjoyed the frozen hot chocolate at Serendipity. Corned beef hash and mushroom omelets were tasty. Make sure you arrive early and get your name on the wait list. Then have a Bloody Mary while while waiting.
1,"i thankfully! found Liz doing a google search for Brazilian blowouts...though i was initially nervous as one might be with a new stylist, Liz immediately set my fears to rest with her extraordinary knowledge and professionalism. this was my first Brazilian blowout, and Liz totally transformed my previously unruly hair into a gorgeous silken mane...I LOVE IT!!! i have been back now for several Brazilians, each one as perfect and longlasting as the first. though i had initially intended on just the Brazilian treatment, i was so impressed with Liz that i had her cut and style my hair too...best thing i ever did! Liz is a master stylist using only the most advanced cutting techniques...all her cuts are very up to date and absolutely ontrend. now i receive compliments on my hair everywhere i go, from complete strangers!  even my teenage daughter is hooked on Liz, and wont let anyone else touch her hair! if you are considering a new stylist, or maybe just a change, you absolutely must try Liz, i guarantee you will NOT be disappointed!!!"
1,"Had dinner here last night with  friends and was very impressed. How they manage to produce  courses of such quality for ua. is a wonder. Service was always efficient and polite and mostly timely. The occasional cobweb in view and the misspelling of California on the wine list were minor quibbles. All  of us began with the Goats Cheese Crumble w Beetroot. For main I had the Turkey Fillet ordering a sidedish of veg with this might be a good idea for some, whilst the girls enjoyed the sirloin on one hand and the Pea Risotto on the other. To finish I plumped for the Banana  Peanut Cheesecake which was an acquired taste but I certainly got what I asked for and the portion size rivals Howies famous Banoffe Pie. The Chilean Cab. Sauv. I washed my food down with was a decent little number too half bottle ua. Definitely one to go back to. Stopped back in here for Afternoon Tea at the end of last week. Good vfm at ua. like most hotels the bar prices are steeper than average though but could have done with jam to go with the scones  cream and I imagine there are probably other places in town that have an edge over it for this sort of thing. If you go though take the option of having it in the garden at the rear as its much more chilled than the bar or lobby."
1,"Love the food! Always fresh, hot and perfectly cooked! My favorite is the Lamb Kabob! nnThe owners are great too! They always greet you with a smile and a hello! I will be a customer for as long as I live here!"
1,"Try their new menu items!!! Juns Kalbi soup is still my favorite, but I had their new dishes such as JaJang men and hot wings. They were awesome!!!!! Juns has the best quality Korean food in the town."
1,"Indie has a great, funky atmosphere, with a nice little patio out back in the shade of a big tree.  The coffee is very good in my opinion, its the only place off the Square that really has good espresso.  Their granitas are very refreshing in summer, and the grilled sandwiches and waffles are tasty.  Their pastries and desserts arent as exciting, but thats OK.  I dont get there as much as I used to when I both lived and worked in the area, but its still the only place with good espresso that is open evenings and Sundays, so I still make the trip sometimes."
1,"Ive been to Culinary Dropout for dinner several times now and have always had a good experience. We tend to eat early so I havent encountered the lines or service problems other reviews have mentioned. Weve always been seated immediately and have had great service. A few people have mentioned the way the staff dresses it is true that the female staff dresses somewhat.... uniquely. Ill just say the words wholesome family restaurant are probably not what comes to mind. nnAnyway, all I care about is the food, which is excellent. My daughter loves the Iberico ham. Their Iberico isnt the month aged acornfed amazing stuff you get at Robuchon, but is still quite good. My other favorites there are the Koreanstyle ribeye cap, fish and chips, pub burger, and fried chicken. The ribeye cap is a musthave, imho. Tender, juicy, and a unique flavor from the marinade. The batter used on the chicken and fish and chips is really nice  very light and airy, crisp and crunchy. The fish in the fish and chips is fresh and flaky. Flavors in the chicken and fish and chips arent particularly unique or interesting, but the batter, quality ingredients, and perfect cooking really serve to elevate them. The pub burger with bbq sauce and bacon is flavorful and juicy. The only dish Ive been disappointed with was the meatloaf. Waiters on two visits recommended the meatloaf so I broke down and tried it even though Im not a meatloaf fan. Sad to say that after trying it Im still not a meatloaf fan. YMMV if youre partial to meatloaf.nnDrinks are a bit pricey, and I wouldnt pick this as the place to guzzle cocktails but the bar area always seems to be hopping. nnOverall, one star off for lacking a bit more creativity in the menu, but four stars for solid execution on what they do have, along with very comfortable seating at both tables and booths."
1,"First time there and all I can say is that it was gooooood...nnThe only downside was that they were smaller than i expected, but good nonetheless...nnI liked the free peanuts as appetizers while waiting for the burgers..."
1,"I wouldnt expect this to be the neatest Marshalls in town, but it was organized and easy to navigate. I kept finding things that are worthy of trying on here whereas I can go through racks and racks of clothing in other Marshalls and maybe find one thing I even want to try on happy me, unhappy wallet. In some locations the  beauty products,especially boxed sets, get all sorts of janky, but there was very few broken items here. nnI would drive to this one over the Charleston and the Decatur locations for the less haphazard shopping experience and much better stock."
1,"Had dinner here last night and was very impressed.  First the food had the green chili beef burrito and was very impressed.  Next time looking forward to trying the chili relleno.  Next the service very attentive staff, not only our waitress but the entire service team checked in on us throughout our meal.  Very courteous.  Finally, the atmosphere this is a very unique setting with indoor seating, patio seating, and a pond the restaurant is built around where the kids can feed the ducks and swans.  Very well laid out and thoroughly enjoyable.  Cant wait to get back for more!"
1,"A very popular spot, we lucked out showing up at pm right when they opened. Its got a bit of a following thanks to Chuck Hughes who was the first Canadian to beat Bobby Flay on Iron Chef, and also has his own Food Network Show. Chuck was in the house the night I was there yes, he actually WORKS in his two restaurants, although I didnt see him. But then again I didnt go into the kitchen. nnThe food was good. Really good. But not OMGthebestiveeverhad. Which is too bad because its been consistently getting  stars. Their homemade cocktails however, are probably worth the trip alone. Try the bourbon berry. YUM. The pear rosemary cocktail tasted like soap however.nnThe menu had changed so most of the previously mentioned dishes werent available. We did try the kimchee with snow crab yum!, and followed it by the seared tuna flat focicca very nice, the cornbread with grilled shrimp only ok, and the halibut with crispy pork decent, but not rave worthy. We had the chocolate ganache pie for dessert. It was good, but not spectacular.nnThe service was really excellent though, so although the food was maybe only a . stars, Ill give that extra bit for the excellent excellent servers.nnIt is pricey though. We paid  for  cocktails,  oysters, and the   sharingtapas style listed above, and one dessert."
1,I never really frequented Sapporo unless it was during Happy Hour.nThey have one of the BEST happy hours.nnThere service is great.  Sushi is fantastic. Clean bathrooms. and atmosphere is a total scene but it comes with North Scottsdale.nnI always come back here when Im back in town visiting.  Its by far one my favorites.
1,"What a gem to have such a large museum in Sin City. At  per adult and  per kid it is very fairly priced when compared to other Natural History museums around the country. Very easy to google a buy one get one free coupon though, so try that before visiting!nnLocated next to a park, across from Childrens museum and adjacent to the Old Morman Fort this is totally an area to hang out at ALL day. nnThe variety of exhibits at this museum is great, a little bit of everything. Yes some of the exhibits are old, some are kind of cheesy, but it just shows you that Vegas isnt putting their money where it needs to be. nnTake your kids and view this museum through their eyes and you will have a blast!"
1,"Went there with my son after a round of Golf.  The beer was reasonably priced, we split and tasty order of wings and had a Cobb Salad that was amazingly good for bar food.  We sat at the bar and found the others in the room friendly and generally enjoying themselves.  The free peanuts are a nice touch. This place is an oasis of down to earth people in the otherwise superficial world of Scottsdale.  I will be back."
1,"I switched my lawn service six months ago to Palms Away from the corporate lawn company I was using previously. It is great to have a local, family owned company who actually cares about my yard and keeps my yard looking top notch. They take care of all regular maintenance, fertilizing, and tree trimming. nnMarcy and her team pay attention to detail and go above and beyond. It is normal business for them to pull weeds by hand, do a final walk through each week, and tidy up my patio when they are done. nnIt is great to come home on a Friday to a perfect lawn and see that the pool toys are picked up, the grill cover was put on the grill, and that the patio furniture is neatly arranged. nnFinally, a lawn company that cares!"
1,"My favorite restaurant... Kale salad, chicken sausage pizza gluten free crust is amazing, curry, shiratake mushroom dish yum yum yum! The natural cold to drink... Half order of most apps amazing!!"
1,"My go to place in Vegas! Every single time we come to Vegas we MUST eat here  this Izakaya joint has been my favourite for a long time. They always have new menu items which are usually delicious. The fish is super fresh, my favs are the toro not always available and the hamachi. I am from Vancouver, the land of good sushi, and this place can definitely compare."
1,"Such a great little cupcake and ice cream spot in the heart of Old Quebec.  Located right alongside the gorgeous Notre Dame to the left precisely if you are facing the basilica makes for a great spot to stop in for a quick treat.nnThe cupcakes are delicious and they provide a great variety of flavors.  A good amount of options for ice cream as well.  Cant decide whether to do ice cream or cupcake??  Really, just have both, theyre totally worth it!"
1,"The best samich Ive ever had. Im hooked on the turkey bacon ranch sub. I love going here, they are friendly and never get my order wrong. I definetely couldnt work here, Id be fat as I dont know what."
1,"I like this place. We went for dinner on a Saturday at pm I have a hard time with the idea of dinner before , but I was tired and starving, and it was already full. However, we were offered a seat at the bar with no wait, so we took it. I was excited about the Peroni on tap. They have a small but great selection of tap beers, including Papagos Orange Cream. We got the traditional red sauce with Italian sausage and mushrooms, which was excellent."
1,Went last year with family.  Went last week with the other family.  Its amazing.nnObviously you should be a Beatles fan to go  its only Beatles.  Mind blowing is all I can think of to say.nnThe nd time I got to see some of the stuff I didnt see the first time  I cant wait to go a rd time to find out what else Ive missed.nnJust go  if youre a fan of the music I cant imagine youd not love Love as much as I did.
1,"For a few years this has currently been my grocery store for all my essential food and toiletries needs.  I like Food  Less because they have a broad and ethnic food selection and I dont have to drive further to WalMart to get my toiletries.  Compared to other grocery stores nearby, their prices are the most reasonable you pay for what you get and the quality of their foods except fruits are pretty good every time I go.nnThe only thing I dont like about this Food  Less location are people keep asking me for money or soliciting out in the parking lot...  Theres usually the same people that hang around there.  I should just carry a sign with my that says, college student in tremendous debt so they wont keep asking me every week."
1,"Once a month my girlfriends and I get together for a long overdue Girls Night!! This month we had the pleasure of trying out Baku, which is centrally located on Sharon Rd. across from South Park Mall. nnUnfreakingbelievable!!! There was something for everyone, Im not kidding!! We decided to start with a few sushi and sashimi dishes to share while we discussed wine and sake options with our server, whom I might add was charming, accommodating, friendly, and overall extremely helpful and patient with all of our questions. He picked out a few bottles of sake for our table to share based on listening to our likes and dislikes, delicious! nnNext, we decided to continue our experience with some skewers the pork belly are to die for and some small bites  words roasted oysters. As new food came, so did new plates, the staff definitely made us feel as if they too, wanted us to have an amazing experience. We tried everything! We ended our meal with surf and turf and vegetable courses, including the spicy filet, lamb chops, duck, Madagascar prawn you have to see this thing!, black cod, salmon, grilled baby artichokes, and portobello mushrooms. nnWe were so stuffed after trying so many delicious items, we almost passed on dessert.... Jk!! We decided to share the creme brufbluee, mango toffee cake, and assorted sorbets. Holy cow!!!! nnFrom the decor and ambiance, to the attentiveness and outstanding service, I know Ill be back and I know we will also be back for more Girls Nights in the near future. This may just be my new favorite restaurant!!"
1,"Clients wanted me to join them for breakfast on a Saturday morning so of course I wanted to go. This is a bread place with limited choices for breakfast items but what they really do well here is the French toast. Set up like a pei Wei style where you order and they bring the food to the table which literally took less than  minutes.french toast was excellent and I could only eat one piece, it was extremely filling. Based on the people in line I would recommend getting here early, it gets extremely busy!"
1,"My bf and I went there last night to celebrate my new job. Boy were we glad we did. nnWe started off with drinks. I had a Retail Therapy and he had their Manhattan. Gotta say two of the best drinks weve ever had. Delish and dangerous. My bf called them panty droppers lol. nnWe had oysters and they were awesome!! I had the oz Filet and bf had the oz Bone in Rib Eye. Both were cooked to perfection. We also had the roasted Brussel Sprouts with bacon, super yummy!!nnOur server was Bradley, it was his th day but youd never know it. Excellent server!!nLooked like a young Steve Buscemi seriously could play him in younger days!nnWe had a weird moment with diners sitting behind us as they proceeded to talk to us after they had quite a few cocktails but it didnt ruin the night just made for a funny story."
1,"Fin crackin!  I was here memorial day weekend  and this shit was very fun!  Lots, I mean LOTS of people.  rubbing elbows with everyone, so if youre not buzzin pretty good it might get annoying.  BUT, there is tons of room outside near the pool where you can get some air, smoke, etc.  Black jack outside near the pool if you get an itch, I was near a bar every time I needed to be near a bar, so theres a good number of them scattered all over.  Lines huge, make something happen so you dont have to wait.  Although, that was then..."
1,I found this florist using Yelp. I live in Los Angeles and was getting married in Las Vegas. I did my entire order over the phone and email. I worked with kimberly and she was amazing. I sent her pictures of the bouquet I wanted and told her what my budget was and she was able to do exactly what I wanted within my budget.  My first wedding was ruined by a florist you forgot to do my bride bouquet so I was extremely nervous however can barely put me at ease and the end result was amazing and exactly what I wanted.
1,"My boyfriend and I stayed at Auberge de la Place Royal for two nights and we absolutely loved it. It is right in the heart of Old Montreal and so many lovely bars and restaurants are within walking distance, as is the metro. The hotel is beautiful and warm, and our room welcomed us with a little chalkboard on the door with my name written on it. It felt romantic and cozy with the rustic furniture and exposed brick and the room even had a corkscrew and little cafe table! The wifi worked perfectly which was great as our American cell phones didnt have service. Note complimentary coffee was remarkably delicious."
1,"aving done my research ahead of time, I knew a few things going in. nnI didnt want to sit in an uncomfortable chair for  minutes and so I looked at the photos with seat numbers on them and the seating chart so that I could choose comfortable chairs along the outside. It is not currently festival seating as others have stated. All seating seemed to offer good lines of sight so it is a matter of price and comfort.nnThe host is rude, crude and socially unacceptable. He is also funny, very funny. Reading the reviews I was led to believe that my ears would bleed and the ushers upon learning that I was from Indiana bet that I would leave within  minutes. nnI admit to being kind of disappointed in that I was anticipating something that would make Andrew Dice Clay blush. Such was not the case. The emcee knew all of the basic swear words and picked on people because of their size, dress and race but nothing was shocking in the least.  His female assistant was much cruder in sexual matters and equally hilarious.nnThe acts all involved impressive acrobatic skills. Being in such an intimate environment made it that much more impresive as opposed to seeing similar feats from the balcony at a Cirque show.nnFor the same price though, I prefer the Cirque shows. The acrobatic talent level seems similar, but while getting more humor you are giving up a much more grand spectacle."

1,"I went here a couple weeks ago to check out METALHEAD on a Sunday night.  I didnt venture around the place so I can only review the music venue portion of the bar.  The cover charge was more than reasonable  and the sound was pretty good.  It really gets packed pretty fast so I would recommend getting there early if coming to see a show.   for a bottled beer really didnt surprise me for a place like this.  Not that its a bad thing, it seemed like that kind of joint when I walked in so just be prepared to shell out some money if you plan on throwing a few back.  Overall, I really like the place and will be back to check out other shows and explore the rest of the bar."
1,"Why oh why did you close down the resort operations. My stay there in March  was great. Nice room, great view and the premises are very nice. You want wanna reconsider are the restaurant prices and add better lounge chairs at the pools."
1,"This is a wonderful place to have lunch or early dinner any day of the week.nnBeing that its a bakery the bread, cookies and muffins are very good.nnThey have sandwiches, fresh tossed salads tossed right in front of you and soups.nnI enjoy the Tuscan chicken which comes with an olive tapenade that is very yummy, so much so I ask for more.  Fresh chicken, tomatoes, cheese and basil makes it one of my favorites.  nnEvery sandwich or sandwich combo comes with a chocolate chip cookie this thrill seems to be consistent with me if youve read any of my other reviews.nnEvery time I think of broccoli cheddar soup I feel like Im eating cheese sauce, but their version is has slivers of carrots that make me feel just a little bit better.  A little.nnWide open seating, free wifi, great food makes this a great spot to get a bite and stay just a bit longer to lounge and let your food settle in."
1,"Fantastic meal at Eleven last week. The best Ive had there of many. This one was star though some have been star. Only complaint was that the white wine was served almost room temp, but this was corrected quickly with an ice bucket."
1,Great theatre.  Cleaner than most.   refill with loyalty cup.  Kids are nicer here than most of the other Harkins Ive encountered.  nnTheatre is huge and parking is available since BWW no longer shares the parking lot.  nnOverall and enjoyable experience.
1,"Ive tried many different coffee shops in many different cities and countries and I keep coming back to st Street. I wont say that I know a lot about coffee, but I will say I drink a decent amount of the stuff and have developed a taste for what I like and what I dont like and st is the best. They use some of the best beans Black Cat and they usually have another espresso option and they are always able to tell me a little about it. The staff is super friendly and can be talkative if you are in the mood. This is another one of those places that already knows my order when we come in. If you need or want some coffee and are downtown or in the Strip District, give them a try! You will not be sorry!"
1,"Ive been here for brunch a couple times and have enjoyed it immensely. nBloody Marys are YUMMMM, Service is awesome and its very clean and the decor is pleasant.Jerk Chicken and Waffles is some of the best in Vegas. Spicy and sweet and te hot sauce choices are much welcomed and appreciated!"
1,"After checkin out my fave NYCo in AZ  the ghetto fab Metro Center, I have a lil time before I hafta get to my next location  am starving.  Lookin for something quick  easy, I initially intend to go to Subway.  Then I see Z Pizza a few doors down  decide to check out the menu.  nnThey had a pretty extensive menu with salads, pastas,  sandwiches offering something for everyone.  Instantly, Im persuaded to order the . special slices of premade pizza  a fountain drink.  Looking  my choices in the warmer, the pizzas had just come outta the oven, so I figure the special is a decent choice.  I go with  slices of the napoli with fresh tomatoes, basil  mozzarella.  It was fantastic!!!  nnLocation is nice too.  If youre in the mood for dessert, theres a coldstone, smoothie place,  starbux within walking distance."
1,"I love this restaurant. Its right next to my house and it my fall back to No.  Boba Tea. They serve desserts crepe, waffles, ice cream sandwiches, ice cream, etc. I love their nuttella and banana waffle. They also have good ice cream sandwiches. If you are in anthem areas then check out this location. Itll satisfy your sweet tooth."
1,"So on a random whim a group of my friends and I decide to go to the M hotel to eat the buffet. When we get there, we realize there is less than an hour to enjoy the buffet so sadly we went to find some place else to eat. One drunk member in my party exclaimed HASH HOUSE! HASH HOUSE! So we look for the restaurant. Before we get seated...we noticed the little sign in front that says if you sit at the bar its happy hour...so the  drunk members of our party staggered towards the bar. nnAnyway after our party of  is seated, we look over the extensive menu and well since  of the  people have never eaten here we ask our server for some tips. I think his name was Brian, he was one of the bartenders and he was AMAZING. He first took our drink orders, and well he made the  drunk guys some SUPER STRONG drinks. SO STRONG that...well maybe Ill finish that story later. Anyway, I like the great DD I am, ordered an Arnold Palmer decent. Anyway after we received our drinks, Brian came and went over the menu section by section. Telling us his honest opinions of what was good and what wasnt. All I have to say is EVERYONE enjoyed their meals. nnALL PORTIONS WERE HUGE. The  dishes from our order that were the best were the crab cake appetizer and the Meatloaf. The meatloaf is unlike any other meatloaf youve ever eaten. Plus you get SOOOOO much for your money. It took sooo many people to finish off that plate. nnAll in all this Hash House A Go Go experience was Top Notch. nnFinal VerdictnIf I want some American Style cooking and Im in Vegas, I will go again."
1,"HOT DAMN!!! And I literally mean that!nnIve been here a half dozen times and today was my second time having the badass chicken curry noodle soup. The first time I ate in and when they brought out the giant bowl you could bathe a child in it with ease I was very pleased. Very balanced curry with a solid kick to it, perfectly cooked noodles, really nothing wrong with it at all. Today was sooo much better though! Ordered it to go pet pet style Thai hot and it was like getting hit in the face with a cinderblock covered in chili sauce. And, oddly enough, I am really okay with that. I sat in my cubicle at work sweating and drooling and blowing my nose like a fool all with a giant grin on my face as I gorged myself. nnMy lunch buddy always goes for the drunken noodles, very appropriate in her case, and I agree that they are delicious...nnIm not really a fan of their Tom Yum or the Tom Ka though. Then again i might have gone on an off day so i will be more than happy to go back for more tries at the rest of the menu.nnOne word of warning to my fellow yelpers. For some reason half of their website is in Latin yes, the actual dead language. Just click around until you get to the printable menu and skip the rest of the website..."
1,"Maybe my favorite Yelp event thus far, as Im a wine lover and the food was exceptional. Ive been to Pittsburgh Winery before, so have experienced their hospitality and great wines in the past. I like what theyre doing here, and appreciate the expertise and devotion that goes into crafting wine of this caliber. And what an exceptional space for an event! I had only ever been on the street level of this business to sample and buy wine, so didnt know what a cool cellar they have. It was fun to hang out, chat with friends and paint glassware nice touch, Rachel!. Gaucho Parrilla was serving up some seriously tasty bites, and the cheese from Wheel  Wedge...well, Ill just say that some of that yummy dairy came home with us. Thanks Yelp!"
1,"Very good place to go for a quick healthy meal. Even though it is a salad buffet, they also have soups, breads, and on different days extra dishes like spaghetti or tacos. For about . you can get the buffet and a drink. The bar is always very clean and the staff is always friendly. They even have a Souper Fresh Club you can sign up for and get coupons and discounts via email, a . coupon is what i get the most. I would recommend anyone to Souper Salad."
1,"Absolutely superb bread! I think the baguette and butter could have sufficed as a meal, for me. nnThe steak au poivre was large, tender, succulent and peppery enough for my taste. The crunchy frites served with it Im not really a fan of, essentially because of the texture. If your palate is not sensitive to crunchy food then I see no reason why you shouldnt enjoy them. nnService was excellent received multiple refills of water with my meal, and later, coffee refills free, too.  Staff is very attentive, overall."
1,"Extremely solid contender in the Mexican food market place! Lived here for  years, passed this place many times, and just tried it out yesterday. Cheese dip was really great, as well as both of our entrees. Service was nearly perfect as well. Place is really colorful and well kept on the inside. Its slightly overpriced, but maybe thats why reviews are consistent over the years... You get what you pay for in life. Will be going back."
1,"Friendly staff, great coffee... The only drawback is even when it is slow there is always a wait for coffee. Other than that if you have a couple extra minutes stop in for a great cup of coffee of three..."

I also feel an intense urge to bust out some old metal band front kicks while putting up the horns and yelling, Slayer! How those two things go together, youll never know...since I just chalk it up to being strange. Trust me, its me...not you.nnIs it possible that my first experience has made me an addict?

1,"Sooo....have you ever been given a tablet pc as a wine list at a restaurant?  I have not.  So freakin cool.  Normally youre given the generic binder type thing and depending on the thickness of it immediately form an opinion of what their wine selection must be.  Well....wow...youre given the tablet and told, Ok miss or whatever, you can choose a wine by type, label, region, vintage, appellation, etc so of course, Im immediately overwhelmed.  I ask for the sommelier and because Im treating long storyits Vegas, I ask for the last wine of the year acc. to Mr. Parker. thats right...big spendernatchha!  Boom!  There it is on the tablet pcwine list thingie.  Funny or curiously enough, my friends had not heard of the famous wine tower with the famous wine angels, so I ask if he can tell us when theyre getting our wine for us so we can watch our corresponding wine angel, so very mission impossibley he presses a forefinger to his ear and says, Uh, Angela?  You got the brunello?  Great. Yeah, can you turn around and wave please? She does.  How cool is that???  How many places can they do that in?  Not many.  Only at Aureole.  Only in Vegas, where Cirque de Soleil is the new Barnum  Bailey. Not only that, but the food is fabulous.  GREAT experience."
1,"Ive been here so many times, I cant believe I havent reviewed Black Bear yet! This is me and my friends goto breakfast place. Ginormous portions, and for a decent price. A little slow on the service, but if youre not in a hurry its no big deal. Basically down home cooking. You see diner and that is exactly what you get. Good eats!"
1,These are tasty tacos. pastor and cucumbers tacos are very good to eat. Yummy. Carne asada is second best. but if you bring your own beer be discrete you wont care about which is best. nnps. What do you call Mexican food while in Mexico? ... Food!
1,I havent been to PVL in over a decade and Ive never been here sober.  Place hasnt changed much but I think It might be a tad cleaner. Bathroom wasnt repulsive. nnThe live music was great although the sound in that place blows. Will definitely return to see some great local bands. nnnPalo Verde Lounge is a  Tempe institution. Great local metal and thrash scene. nDont be scared its not that bad.
1,"The Spotted Donkey makes the drive to North Scottsdale worth it. The restaurant provides a Southwestern filled fun experience! The vibe here is trendy Mexican with colorful walls, wooden furniture and enjoyable music. Large enough to seat a party of ten or quaint enough to seat a party of two, I enjoy coming here for any occasion. nnWhen the weathers nice, its ideal to sit on the patio and enjoy the evening with some margaritas and tasty guacamole to start.  My favorite dish is the stuffed peppers which are poblano chiles filled with roasted pork, cheddarjack cheese and Spanish rice, in a fresh basil tomato sauce. Its a hefty meal but tastes so good that its hard not to finish each and every bite of it. I choose one of their homemade margaritas to wash it down and if its a really exciting night, Ill have the queso in addition to the guacamole for starters. I choose this restaurant when Im looking for a hearty Mexican meal with the feel of the true southwest. nnAs I mentioned, I absolutely love the environment at the Spotted Donkey. Making its home on the second floor of Pedregal, I can see the rock formations lingering over the buildings and the desert breeze is crisp and refreshing since we are away from the city. Its a fun experience and I always try to find an excuse to make the drive north so I can make a visit to the Spotted Donkey."
1,"Every single time I come here, my husband has to drag me out. The dogs and cats are sooo cute, I always want to take at least  or  home every single time. We adopted our kitten from there and she was spayed the morning of the day we picked her up. Staff was friendly and courteous, the shelter is clean and organized, and the pets look healthy... whats not to like? I love this place! If it was closer to home, Id come here more often.nnId love to get a second cat, or dog... hopefully sometime in the near future and i intend on getting it from here gotta talk hubby into it tho. Who knows, maybe Ill just get lonely one day when he deploys and Ill just come here and bring another one home, this way I dont have him saying NO... NO... NO... keep walking... NO! to every single animal I lay my eyes on. Im a sucker for those furry little guys  Husbands says this is the first stage of animal hoarding andor someday Ill be the old lady with  cats... and quite frankly, I can actually see it happening haha."
1,"Very cool and chic bar upstairs.  Contemporary.nnLive Jazz in the evening, that wasnt obnoxious, nor loud.nnService was excellent.  Waitress made every effort to seat six of us, without a reservation, at  pm, on a Saturday.  And she was pretty.nnA little older crowd.  Our group age range was from  ish, but many of the other diners were cool old people.  Slicked grey hair, well dressed, and not loud.  But, honestly, average age was about . Just sayin, a little mature.nnFood was WONDERFULL. Eggplant bruschetta, seared ahi tuna bites, GIANT blue point oysters, wedge salad, and crab and shrimp stuffed mushrooms in a sauce that we had to fight over...WONDERFULL.nnVERY VERY YUMMY.nnPrice cant recallnnDrinks  full bar, stiff martinis.nnParking stinks.  you must park in a garage and walk, or valet.  Not to far to walk, however.nnA great alternative to Ocean Club, which is great, but this place has food with tons of Italian influenced flavor."
1,"We had an INCREDIBLE steak dinner here! The service was spot on, the food nothing short of delicious. nSteak frite was prepared to order with incredible meat, perfect frite.nThe drinks were great and the staff was kind. nNext time in Vegas, Im here."
1,"Quantity and quality.nnI enjoy the pastrami and corned beef.  I tried their hotdog and found it very tasty.  The potatoe cakes are awesom although I dont eat them with the applesause because I just dont get that.  The fries are decent but I avoid the cole slaw and potatoe salad as Im not a fan of the flavor profile.  The portions are very big.  My mom ordered a small chef salad and found that to be very large.  The Jewish sliders are wonderful.nnThey have a wonder bakery with cakes, slices of cake, cupcakes and an wonderful assortment of cookies.  nnOf course they bagels, every flavor and all the fixings to go along with them.  They also sell their breads packaged for take home."
1,"My wife and I were on a little getaway up in Scottsdale and decided to stop here for breakfast. It was wonderful. Be warned, the portions were pretty large and we both could have walked out with to go orders had we not been staying at a hotel. She got the crabby, which I think was a great deal since, it had two crab cakes atop an already sizable omelette. It wasnt surprisingly good. It was exactly what you would expect or hope for. No more and no less, which is more than i can say for most breakfast places. I would definitely get it again. I got the meat and cheese omelette. Im a sucker for smoked gouda so this was everything i hoped for and more. My only criticism is of what this places refers to as the DD hash. Its skillet cooked mixture of butternut squash and sweet potatoes with some caramelized onions. It sounds great, but was surprisingly lacking in flavor. I attribute this to poor seasoning and a maybe a lack fo salt, but it wont stop me from coming back the next time I am in town. All in all this is a great little place with good atmosphere and a fun menu. Its definitely worth a try."
1,"Qdoba Who?nFunniest thing happened, as I walked into a Qdoba I felt like i walked into a chipotle. Yes, same thing. Except that I had no idea what Qdoba means, and Im Mexican but it looks more like a middle eastern word.n  The concept at Qdoba  All the ingredients are laid out in front of you. You pick  from burrito to tacos or just a bowl or naked burrito, you pick your protein, steak, chicken or pork and last you pick all your toppings and you have a meal. A very good  Quality meal for a very good price, fast!n I really like the location there is plenty of parking  and right across from my favorite star bucks. The place is clean and the service is also great. Great for quick lunch or a nice casual dinner with friends.nn  Some useful, information. The word Qdoba has no meaning, it was created by Qdoba marketing because two previous names they used were already being used by someone else. funny so they decided to come up with a unique name and they ended up with Qdoba.cool"
1,"I have NEVER gone to a chain spa for a massage, but after last night, I will  or at least check reviews yelp to figure out who to see!  I am staying at the Canyons Villas and I would normal go to the Revive Spa at the JW Marriott, but I wanted to stretch my budget.  I am so glad I did.  I booked a  hour massage with BRAD.  He was amazing.  His training includes energy work, and you can tell, ok I could tell immediately.  I have had over  different massagetherapists and I have never felt so much release and energy movement.  Yesi was great in Palm Desert, but Brad is even better.  If you have the chance he should be somewhere else with his talent, book Brad.  You wont be disappointed, but be prepared to be feel the work. If you are faint of heart, let him know and he will lighten up  otherwise enjoy the gift."
1,"I have to admit I wasnt expecting much because the kitchen didnt look like they had anything in stock and nothing was presented at the register area... I guess Im used to Starbucks merchandising with the fancy refrigerated cases, signage and etc. nnThe menu is limited but the drinks are on point! Soy Chai!  nnI also really like the local coffee shop feel. If I lived closer, I would hang out here and read a book or get some work done."
1,"We came here for my cousins bachelor party.nnIt was everything youd expect to from a Vegas Nightclub on strip. Loud and fun music, girls in skimpy outfits.  GoGo girlies, Mini stages for drunk and trashy girls to go dance on.nnNot really sure what else to say... We had fun... We spent a lot of money, at am, I drunkenly decided that I wanted brunch from a place that wasnt open and got thrown out by hotel security... But we had fun..."
1,"I LOVE this place!  While randomly driving through the Melrose District, I came upon this lovely treasure.  This place doesnt look like much from the outside, and you very well might drive right past, but look for it and go in!  Every room I walked into, there was another room to explore, and each room had a ton of different goods.  nnWhen you walk into this store, you might initially think the stuff is all junk, but its not.  Theres more quality products than junk here, and the prices are usually right.  I ended up exploring for two hours here and then bought a red dresser that probably couldnt be found anywhere else for .  The man working there was nice enough to bring the dresser outside by my car and also offered to load it for me.  I plan to return again and again to furnish my new apt, and I cant wait!  Be forewarned though All sales are FINAL. though i cant imagine youd want to return anything you bought here!"
1,"A Beacon in the NightnnWe should have known that something was amiss when my cellular device buzzed and the illuminated screen said, the sky is broken.  Upon exiting the comfy confines of collegetown comfort the momentum and magnetic pull should have been confirmed.  But it wasnt until we stood watching horizontal rain and a sky that flickered like a worn out patio light bulb pulsating on its deathbed that the thought finally came.  Turning to my companion with what has become an apparent telltale sign of mischievous promises I cleared my throat and put for the quandary are you up for some more adventure?nnThe streets of Phoenix looked as if they had been struck a mighty blow by the scientifically classified hurricanes that I had only just recently fled.  But a hurricane in Arizona?  The thought was laughable at best and even with power deficient streets and the scattered limbs of a thousand broken trees leading the way it wasnt until we arrived that the realization dawned upon us.  City blocks in every direction were dark, street lights were nothing more than dark tendrils of metal postings marking an intersection of streets where heavy traffic should be still flowing strong at even this late hour.  The lone beacon in the night was a neon green sign beckoning us in from the storm the calm and cool interior of Shadys called.nnShadys is one part hipster heaven and one part dive bar delight.  A tiny low ceiling building welcomes all and first timers that are arriving on grape vine recommendations always sport the same look of you mean this is it facial contorting confusion.  There is a lone bar that even at the busiest of Friday nights is only large enough for a maximum of two bartenders to man and even then it can sometimes be cramped quarters.  There is a pool table, but if you are there during peek hours it is nearly impossible to play a proper game.  The bar is the place to be, but if this isnt your style a small line of booths horseshoe the pool table and a selection of comfy chairs are arranged in front of a fireplace that I have never seen hold more than a few candles, let alone an honest to goodness fire.  Add to this mix some of the best bartenders in the valley who will sling you any number of custom designed concoctions, old favorites and a bevy of ice cold beers in a maddening variety and you have a very choice locale in which to pine away the hot summer months.  What once was a seldom used back patio is now a hot bed of activity on any given day you can ban smoking from bars but you will never remove the cold hard habit of a beer in one hand and a smoke in the other.  Of course no bar I will list in my top  favorites would be complete without a colorful cast of patrons and Shadys has never failed to deliver to me a witty conversation that I wouldnt engage or some bizarre miscreant to gawk at.nnThe quaint interior, friendly regulars, numerous quality beers on tap and kick ass bartenders are all good but there is one key element that one and all seem needful of.  When the bartenders are too busy for small talk and the conversations lull into silence and those off times when all you want is a beer and a little bit of solace we all need something else besides our own bar mirror reflections to be distracted by.  And Shadys delivers this with a knock out blow.  Forget for a moment that the pint you are sipping could come in conjunction with a viewing of Better off Dead playing in subtitles on one of several TV screens over the bar.  Is it ok to stop and smile as you watch the words form in your own head and found yourself saying out loud, never, ever feed them after midnight along with the cast of Gremlins.  Though if the distraction of long forgotten or just straight up good movie watching isnt your cup of tea then there is always the legendary jukebox to provide your needed distraction.nnIf you dont like punk, you can always pick a couple of tunes from old blue eyes.  If you dont like punk and Sinatra isnt your thing, stink the place up with some James Brown funk.  I you dont like punk, cant do Sinatra, despise James Brown then you can always grab a Johnny Cash tune.  If you dont like any of these musical selections then go home you are in the wrong bar.  If you are however a fan of good punk rock than Shadys will offer up a selection of great bands and odd bsides that will have you in Mohawk heaven. nnLike most popular and hipper locations Shadys is packed to the rafters on Friday and Saturday nights.  nnThere is no kitchen, so eat before you go.  nnNever a cover and proper attire is never required."
1,"Sean is the man! Finally, I found someone who actually works on the motorized Razor scooters. After calling, then driving to  different locations I was ready to give up.  They fixed them quickly, super pleasant to work with and reasonably priced."
1,"ok now. good lord. talk about a nice place. nnive noticed i dont seem to review high end restaurants too nicely. i tend to be very critical of every last detail from the flaps of the toilet paper being folded up, to my napkin being replaced properly every time i leave the table. its not that im a prick and demand the world revolves around my every whim, i just expect when you pay out your ass, some fucker better be kissing it and asking if the temperature and texture of their lips are to my liking. i kid i kid. i actually hate kiss ass waitstaff. i just have two requirements for a good waiter. one, know what they are doing, aka know food. this one time at lark creek steak, i asked our waiter,  is this mirco arugula?  he had that look like.... wtf is micro arugula. he had to go back to find out. ehhhh i can understand, newbie and all. second requirement, dont be an ass. the host and waiter are the first impressions of the restaurant for me. if either or both blows it there goes the meal. nnso this last time around in vegas a buddy of mines comped us our rooms so i thought i should at least buy a nice dinner for everyone. the four of us found ourselves at fleur de lys in mandaly bay on sat night. how swanky. upon entering, im like wow, this is soo not my scene. except for the waitstaff, not a single diner was close to our age. ehh thats alright. nnwe were seated in the tiny bar area if you can even call it that for a quick minute. it was cramped. good thing we were seated at our table quickly. nnthe dining area is awesome. beautiful. the shape of the restaurant is a bit odd, but then again, the fact that i forgot we were inside a casino  goes to show how well they designed this place. very simple, yet oh so elegant. low key but badass. very much my style. not gaudy at all, a nice simple hotness about the place. nnour waiter was great. laughed with us, answered everything properly. at first he was more mmmm, proper and was a bit rigid, but showing signs of someone who knows how to work it in the hospitality business, he adjusted and became more loose and that in turn made us feel more welcomed. i wish more waitstaff folks could understand that... or probably more accurately care enough and do their job well enough to make their guests happy. nnthe food was outstanding. every bite was better than the next. my roasted squab just melted in my mouth. it was FANFUCKINGTASTIC. i can easily say this was probably one of my top  favorite meals of all time. nnbut i must stress this again, the folks working here make the place. the staff here makes you feel truly welcome..... and only then can you really have a very pleasant dining experience."
1,"Best place to get your hair cut and beard trimmed!! nnI have tried many barbers over the past couple of years and always am very happy and say Ive found the one..... Couple days later the feelings are just ok. nnI happened across Tony Stark out in BFE queen creek in a tiny little shack on the side of the road. I was out there for work and had some time to kill and desperately needed a cut. Cant be that bad right? After all he is Ironman.....nnHe asked questions gave suggestions and I walked out REALLY happy!!! I thought, give it a few days as usual and I will look elsewhere, after all hes all the way out there!!!  A week later I knew Id make the trip again every month!!nnNew month, new closer location!!!!nnWINWINnnDo yourself a favor and give him a try. You wont regret it!!"
1,"What a great experience.  Having never been to a cinema that served drinks as well as had pre selected seats, it really was a great place for a night out.  Buying the tickets online was so easy, the staff were helpful and the lines short.  Beers were well priced and my girlfriend said her hot chocolate was delicious.  I really recommend this place if you want to watch a new release in comfortable seats, cheaply and easily accessible."
1,"Oh, man.  This place is AWESOME.nVery romantic  fewer than  tables in a small bistro.  Daily menu for main entrees with a specialty appetizer, as well as a regular menu of salads, and the best calamari I have ever put in my mouth.  Lightly breaded with a honeycilantro glaze.  No need for marinara here!nThey have a nice beer and wine selection as well.  The ambiance is so nice, and the service is great, too.nThis is an excellent place to take someone special when you want to make an impression."
1,"LGO was fantastic.  Great food, great staff, and an outstanding storefront with the best English Muffins I have ever tasted.  I have dined in twice however, and found the service to be a little on the slow side.  Also, with regard to crowding and poor parking, LGO suffers from both."
1,"UPMC is truly world class medicine  it just is  speaking from experience as a patient AND as a healthcare worker. nnUPMC makes up a whole hospital system that has several main hospitals and out laying clinics in Pittsburgh and around the world. They have hospitals in Italy, Ireland, Egypt, etc... and in Pittsburgh alone, looking at Hillman Cancer Center, Shadyside, Presby, etc... its fantastic. nnI have worked at Shadyside and Presby  I cant speak ill on either one. Presby is truly a world of its own, though. Its massive and is comprised of MANY intensive care units  neurotrauma, CCU, surgical ICU, cardiothoracic ICU, liver transplant ICU, medical ICU, etc... The population at presby is VERY sick  they take on clients that no one else will touch because of surgeries being high risk, etc.. and they give patients a chance. nnThe nurses are EXCEPTIONAL, very smart, very well educated and very on top of things, if not overworked and understaffed which is more of a state of the nation, not so much a UPMC specific problem. But when nursing is understaffed, patient care suffered and patient satisfaction drops. nnThe docs are also really excellent. I only worked in the intensive care units there, but I can honestly say that I would send my family there in a heart beat. nnParking is really expensive, they do have vallet services which is great for the ER needs as well. The cafeteria is really big and on the top floor. Presby also bridges over to the eye and ear institute and montifore hospital. They are a level  trauma center, heart, lung, liver transplant center... When I was there, they were not a burn center, however. nnReally sick? Need great care?  Go to UPMC. I would move back across the country to get care in Pittsburgh  thats how much faith I have in their medical practices."
1,"Small, local bar with New Mexican food. We went for happy hour on a Monday and ordered chicken quesdaillas and chicken nachos. The service was amazing. The bartender was our server and a hostess for the restaurant. Despite her having to hustle and bustle all around the restaurant, she kept up a happy and a very pleasant attitude and she kept an eye on our food and drinks at all times.nnThey had great beer on tap for hh . The food was good but kind of heavy, but my husband said that New Mexican food is like that. I think we found our local reverse happy hour spot."
1,"Awesome food! Come here if you are an adventurous eater, as they have some notsoaverage choices! Hibiscus tacos, corn chowder, and crab and mango salad are only a few of the many delicious items! Our waiter was very caring and descriptive of the food, and we definitely will return!!!"
1,"If I die and come back as a dog, I am going to live near the Bark Park.  Who ever designed the place did  a wonderful job.  nFirst view a dog with his bone and behind the dog a dog house.  nthe bones in the park are for humans to sit on, the dog house is for humans to take care of bodily needs and the dog statue is just cute.nnAs other have mentioned the are  parks, dogs under  lbs, over  lbs and an obstacle course.  There is shade canopy and regular seating for humans.  Nice green grassy ares for the dogs to run and socialize.  My experience is that the dogs in the under  lbs are well manner and socialize well.  nnThe dogs have their own water park, behind the dog house you will find  red fire hydrants, that put out a fine mist of water to cool the dogs off on hot summer days.nThere are bone seats for us humans.nnThe park is relatively new   bit there is plenty of vegetation, and in a few years the park will be nicely landscaped and some what shaded.nnA marvelous idea and design, and let me also mention the city maintenance of  the park is will taken care of, from doggy bags, to power washing the walkway.nnHappy to go there as a human, delighted to go there as a dog."
1,"We returned for that deliciously sinful buffalo chicken dip. We also ordered a half sheet of the Pizza Bianco. Three of us filled up and we still had a few slices leftover. We reheated them the next day and Id say those slices were even better than fresh. Nice flavor, thick crust. I wouldnt hestitate to order it again. Im told the Bacon  Eggs is really special. I might just have to give that a whirl."
1,"The chili cheeseburger is phenomenal!! The place is a holeinthewall but its a must try!! They only accept cash and there is no seating. There is a big picnic table behind the restaurant beside the trash cans, and its not uncommon to see white collar and blue collar workers enjoying a classic American burger at this table. During lunch, the line wraps around the building. If you love burgers, you have to try this place.  They also make an excellent sausage sandwich for breakfast."
1,"I intensely love Gado Gado..I have eaten there about five times now..rour for dinner and one lunch. the Chef is wonderful and exciting..Some of our favorites are the Calamari...Lighty fried  with Kalamata Olives and Capers Drizzled with lemon ailoi! The Gnocchis are Herb sauced with a light wine sauce...melt in your mouth! The Chefs Soups are wonderful, I have tasted the Smoked Tomato Bisque and the Vicchysiue Incredible..I would highly reccomend it and its in the Suburbs!! Nice..."
1,"Have yet to try anything off the menu, but I love coming here just for the atmosphere. Great place to end a date or night out with friends. Service is friendly and the whole place is very casual and laid back. Worth a stop if youre over on that side of town."
1,"I dont think I could have survived without Tory! In addition to being well connected  I think she knows everyone in the wedding industry and having a great eye for detail, Tory is exceptionally personable and knows how to decrease stress levels. I was unusually stressed during the few days surrounding my wedding and Tory took on communicating with vendors and family, coordinating transportation and deliveries, and decor. We had a detour on the way to the wedding due to an accident and Tory was on the phone with limo drivers giving them alternate routes to our venue. Everything she did for us was above and beyond our expectations."
1,Lovely place to sit and have quiet time. They have a great area for children and helpful staff. They also have a Starbucks with some lunch options. They will serve you on glass plates and warm up your pastries
1,"Friday night is our traditional family night, take the teens and finally relax after typical frantic school, work blah blah blah. In Summerlin at  pm its not too easy to get a table at a restaurant that suits fussy kids plus parents. nnIve been using Open Table in combination with Yelp to avoid disappointment and the itll be  minutes for your table response that you will hear at popular family places like The Yardhouse or BJs.nnWhen I tell Management I have booked Embers, her response was lees than enthusiastic. The old Embers was a sort of BBQ joint hidden beneath a quite sophisticated Boca Park location. We hate BBQ.nnbut,but,but I eloquently respond theres a new menu.nnWe arrive and are greeted by a very friendly hostess, offered two different tables, window or booth in back and are promptly seated.nnOur server immediately arrived and got us drinks and sodas.nnMenu has changed, extensive without being over complicated.nnWe had a couple of appetizers, ahi tuna on little rice cakes, delicious, light and well presented. After they were done, the Tandoori chicken skewers arrived. Just as good.nOur server noticed that one of the teens wasnt eating and brought him a bread basket. Nice touch.nnMains We shared Beef Tacos, Griiled Salmon, Fish  Chips and the Cheese Burger. All were top notch.nnBelly full,  beers, two Chardonnay, countless sodas  before tip.nnWe are coming back, it will be a new regular venue."
1,"Upstairs at Imperial Palace, the digs arent quite as funky in a good way as the location on Sahara, but the food is great.  Sage Fried  Cicken Benedict starts with a fluffy biscuit then layers on mashed potatoes, fried eggs, bacon, and sage fried chicken and then tops it all off with chipotle sauce for an outstanding meal that, in this case, served three easily when accompanied by a banana brown sugar pancake that was at least  inches in diameter.  But first things first... Start the meal with one of their famous and fabulous bloody Marys or a house tangerine mimosa to get off on the right foot.  This is a great place for an unusual breakfast or brunch.  Beware!  All meal portions are huge."
1,"My sister passed along a free movie pass so the hubby and I went yesterday. This place is really nice! Im not much of a drinker, but the bar was impressive. nnWe were the first of  people to arrive for the afternoon showing of The Immortals. The movie was nothing to write home about, however the theater is. The seats are roomy and comfy with a tray for food that slides back  forth. It would have been nice if the seats reclined more. I ordered the popcorn which was buttery, salty and yummmmmy nnI took  star away because the volume was crazyloud. I anticipate the volume being loud which is why I always bring earphones to the movie. It was still so loud that I couldnt hear the sarcastic comments I was making in my head about Micky Rouke."
1,"OMG! This place is heavenly!  Ive tried a total of four different flavors now and each one has the same moist mouth watering trait.  The chocolatechocolate cake with the chocolate chips... so good.  It had the right amount of sweetness and wasnt too chocolately.  The first bite I took of the seasonal pumpkin spice was reminiscent of Thanksgiving dinner and really gave me a taste of autumn even though it still feels like summer in Vegas.  I can still taste the wonderful pumpkin in my mouth.  I wouldve liked it if they added some chocolate chips in this one too it wouldve been that much better.  nnIm a fan of sprinkless red velvet cupcakes and I always made an effort to stop by when in the area.  That was the extent of my cravings though.  I never went out of my way to pick up a cupcake.  Nothing Bundt Cakes is a different story.  As soon as I finished up my cake, I kid you not, all i could think about was that red velvet bundt... so moist, with the chocolate chip pieces, and the sweet cream cheese frosting.  I had to compare!  Sprinkles is good, dont get me wrong, but their red velvet is really sweet and then its topped with a big whop of extra sweet frosting.  I almost always scraped the frosting off because it was overkill.  Plus, it doesnt have chocolate chip pieces, come on!!!!nnIll pass on the pecan praline.  This one didnt do much for me and didnt have that zest the other favors had.  I cant even say what I didnt like about it because after a couple bites I put it to the side it didnt leave a memorable impression on me.  I still have to try their other favors but the red velvet alone deserves five stars.nnAnyway, Its a cute little shop with friendly employees.  For a few bucks more they wrap your bundt up with a flower and a personalized note It makes for a thoughtful gift."
1,"I have stayed at Mandalay Bay twice, once on purpose, and once on accident. The one on purpose was way back in , for a surprise trip to Vegas for my st birthday. The hotel was pretty new and was the fanciest, most beautiful place I had ever stayed up until then.nnThis review is about the time I stayed there on accident, in .nnMy then boyfriend now Hubs had never been to Vegas, so I decided to surprise him with a trip to Vegas a few weeks after his birthday. To make things even more memorable, he proposed to me on HIS birthday. So, we had several things to celebrate  his th birthday and our engagement.nnI had gotten a killer deal through Vegas.com to stay at theHotel now youre probably seeing where the accident part of this comes in. We would be flying out of Sonoma County to Vegas and staying at theHotel for three nights, all for about . Total. Killer deal, right?nnWhen we got to the front desk of theHotel the agent asked if we wanted to upgrade to a Penthouse at Mandalay for  extra dollars a night. Im not afraid to admit that on this trip we had a strict budget, so we declined the upgrade. The agent, a little surprised by our decline of the penthouse, tried to talk us into the deal by showing us pictures of the room and telling us that we would have a private entrance, etc. As sweet as it sounded, it was a nogo for us. Plus I really wanted to stay at theHotel. The agent told us to hold on while he talked to his manager. He came back and offered the upgrade for  for all three nights. At this point I realize that they overbooked at theHotel and are trying to avoid telling us that by trying to get us to pay for an upgrade at their sister hotel. My now fiance, in his wisdom, told them, No, we would really rather spend the money on gaming at Mandalays casino. The agent steps away again and comes back and tells us that the Penthouse upgrade will be complimentary. I say Sweet and he says, No, Penthouse. nnThis killer deal of ours included a  resort credit, which I asked our agent if it covered the resort fee. He said usually no, but that he would waive the resort fee. We were definitely feeling like some lucky SOBs at this point.nnOkay, so now we have a Penthouse. And  resort credit, and no resort fees. Things are looking good. We find the private elevator and up we go to the second highest floor. Granted, we are facing the airport but I dont think we really cared too much at this point.nnThis penthouse was insane. I felt like we needed an entourage to stay there. HUGE is the only way to put it.nnHowever, the rooms are starting to show their age. The air conditioner in the living area rattled a bit funny story there involving the handyman who came to work on it, but its not something I will share on Yelp. Some of the controls didnt work great. But for the price we paid it was amazing. So baller. And quiet on those top floors. Seriously, the private elevator thing was so nice.nnMandalay Bay treated us well. No one trying to sell us stuff as we walked through the casino, just staff handing out free passes and being very helpful. Got free passes to Mix and had a lovely time looking out from that vantage point. It also helps that we won some money on Roulette at a little table we found. nnWe saw The Lion King here, which was phenomenal.nnCheckout was a bit of a pain in the ass with the wait, but otherwise our time here was a happy one, and perfect for our multitude of reasons to celebrate. nnIm not usually one to stay in the same place twice, so I wont be back for a repeat stay since Ive been twice already, but I will always remember the time we got to live it up in a Penthouse."
1,"It is rare that I take the time to complete a survey on service, but I was compelled to as my husband and I are always so impressed with this service.  The drivers are consistently accommodating and friendly.  We have come to look forward to this service and driver interaction being a part of our trip!"
1,"I have been to several other airbrush salons in the Scottsdale area and I think that Arizona Airbrush Studio is by far the best of them all!!  Donna makes you feel very comfortable and is very educated about the product.  I have a little bit lighter skin color and was very nervous my first time going, but she took the time to answer all of my silly questions and concerns nnI would recommend showing up early to your appointments  she moves very quickly but efficiently.  The color that they use is very pretty  I have never had a bad color or any streaking!  Try them out!"
1,"Yeah, everything is just a little bit more expensive on The Strip.  But at least here it feels like you are getting a bit more for your money, unlike some of the other blah blah eats on the strip.  The environment is great, inside the Luxor and the duecor is very modern with a pretty fancy but sporty looking bar area.  The staff was friendly, you get FREE CHIPS and salsa that tasted homemade.  You get TWO types of salsa, green and red spicy and mild.  Then the food, cooked well, presentation was great, and the servings were more than adequate.  The drinks are made with fresh squeezed fruit so prepare to buy several because they are just damn good.  And the food was served quick.  Will be back on our next trip without a doubt."
1,"Theres nothing I like more than a well marbled NY strip. OK  maybe a tender free range chicken. Any piece of meat I have purchased from Old Time has not let me down. Well, the Dietz  Watson deli meats are wonderful but still pale in comparison to Boars Head available at the IGA over on Mattis. Its all fresh, favorful and kosher! If your deep freezer is empty  you can save a ton when you buy in bulk.nnIts the local butcher shop me and my fiancee had been waiting for. And after three years of being open for business, Old Time Meat  Deli is rarely crowded and I can never figure out why. Its a good thing for customers in the know..."
1,"Old south Charlotte standby ... this is just a great option when you want something comfortable ... but not TOO comfortable meaning you will eat well here.  Short of fine dining, Mamas is right there with Ilios Noche now that is SOUTH Charlotte for our favorite pasta options in town.nnThe management staff changed over within the last year or so, and the new crew seems to have even stepped it up a notch.  This place seems to be humming along at least as well as ever before."
1,"Fresh ingredients, friendly service, a familyrun, breath of fresh air to our neighborhood in Glendale! The two of us ate take out plenty for just over  plus tip. All of the sauces and things I didnt know what they were, rather than describe them to me, they had me try! Just like I was in someones grandmothers kitchen a good feeling. The kitchen is right behind the counter so you see your food being prepared, cooked and served. All the better to ask questions while they do it.nnOn the down side they were out of falafel and a few other dishes when I came in around pm on a Saturday evening. The place was deserted, I even asked if they were open. nnAll in all a charming place and nice find of a new restaurant and gracious hosts. We will definitely come again!"
1,"Best. Place. EVEEER. nbeen going there for years and never had a single bad experience. everytime I go there i have higher expectations and they are always met. People here go out of their way to make sure that you like your food, waiters know evrything that goes on a sandwich down to the ingredients of the dressing. Best of all the prices are very reasonable and the atmosphere is so Willylike. ndo yourself a favor and try the veggie sandwich, your life will never be the same again! I pretend not to like meatloaf but if someone Im with orders it, I make sure they dont have any leftovers. thats how good this place is..."
1,"This hotel was super cheap to stay at during the off season. Came here with my girlfriend in November and it was  a night !!! Great atmosphere within the hotel and I loved the interior design. The main floor is a casino but if you go up to the second level, there is an arcade. That is also where the entrance to the roller coaster is located. They had some great games at the Arcade too. You can also find Herseys Chocolate World attached to the hotel. I think this is a new attraction since I dont recall seeing it in the past before.nnWe booked the most basic room you could find and it was very welcoming. Had all the amenities we would expect, AC, Cable, Free WiFi, King Size clean bed, Sofa and great window view of the roller coaster.nnMy only gripe with this hotel as with any other place in Vegas is that the food was very expensive. They did have a Pizza place that was super cheap to eat at. All the other places charged on average  per person. Thats what you would expect to pay if you went anywhere on the strip. I wont knock the hotel down because of this though. nnThe hotel had a very family friendly atmosphere and I would definitely stay here again."
1,"Really great Pancakes, Burgers, Salads and HASH! Dirty chai is amazzzzzzing and the Moscow Mules are pretty delicious too! Handmade Mozzarella is to die for. Dog friendly and fair priced. I come here a lot and will continue to"
1,"I was visiting from out of town here after work with my coworkers.  nNice place, food was pretty good.  I got the BBQ Peach Pork dinner WOW I was impressed!  Id get it again, pork was thick soft and juicy.  Greens were not overly cooked and flavorful, the relish on top was cold and fresh and the mash potato was thick and creamy not like out of a box taste.  The apps were good and the drinks were even better.  We ordered and shared  slices of pecan pies, it was warm and a lot of pecans yummy!nStaff was friendly and helpful of the menu.nSince I was visiting, Id go back and try other things.  My coworkers enjoyed all the pork orders more flavorful than the beef.  Tacos were good.  Not fond of paying for chips and salsa though.  I would think it comes with ordering a meal."
1,"The owner of the Attic recommended we stop by Williams Costume Co and were glad we did.nnMy friend wears a pair of glasses that are decorated with rhinestones. Over the years a few have fallen out and she has attempted to replace some alittle unsuccessfully. While visiting this store we met Glenda the Rhinestone Queen. HER NAME TAG DOESNT LIE.nnShe knew exactly what sizecolortype of stones my friends glasses needed. She was able to tell which stones my friend incorrectly replaced AND Glenda even glued in the missing stones for us. She was fantastic!nnMy friend also picked up some sequins and appliques and Glenda cut us a deal. Which is the nicest thing my friend could have asked for being a fashion design student on a budget.nnIf you want some bling, TALK TO GLENDA."
1,Being from Chicago I was waiting for this place to open!  Still love it!  Gotta get the italian beef with lots and lots of hot peppers!  They have yummy crinkle fries if I remember correctly.  I also order some gravy on the side. basically its au jus the beef is cooked in.  So delicious!  Now that they have been open a while its not as packed as when it first opened.
1,"Couldnt have asked for a better experience.  Bon was our chef and he was Amazing!  The all you can eat deal is the best... especially if you can put away the sushi.  Like most other reviews say, the place is small, busy and crowded.  That being said, we never waited more than a couple of minutes for the sushi we asked for."
1,We went here on a Sunday night and it was very quiet.  Sat in the bar and ordered cocktails until the rest of our party showed up.  Wanted to try a signature cocktail but in the end I opted for a cosmo. My hubs ordered a martini dry up with olives.  He said there was something sweet to it.  They serve a cheesy bread type thing with the cocktails.  Im not a big bread eater but tried one and it was ok.nnNow on to the food.  I ordered the tongue in cheek which was the beef cheek.  It was very good but a little on the salty side and I like salt.  I also ordered the brussel sprouts which were tasty.  My friend ordered the salmon which she said was good.  There was also an order of  eggplant which I thought was delicious and seasoned just right.  Came in a small cast iron skillet.  Perfect size for a light meal and pipping hot.  I also tried a mushroom dish with toast but I dont recall what it was called.  It was very good.nnThis place has a cool vibe and the service was very good.  Not the very best meal I have ever had but I would certainly come back here.  It is sort of in a weird spot in the bottom of an office building.
1,"Trusted yelpers and glad I did. This place is the go to Thai food when youre in Vegas.nnIm reserving the  star rating until I try the bar setting dishes like pad Thai or pud se ew. I did try the tom yum koong and garlic prawns and both dishes were fantastic! nnspiciness tip if you can eat really spicy food, get level . we made the mistake of ordering level  and wow, my mouth was on fire the whole meal."
1,"Top Four Reasons I Love Four Peaksnn.  My man can get tipsy on Kiltlifter which he love, loves and it makes him happy.  It seems like all the boys love the Kiltliftern.  The pasta salad and steak sandwich are super freakin goodn.  I love that little doll face Courtney at the Tempe location, she is super sweet and she is always on itn.  Your chicken rolls are greasy, fattening deliciousness and that jalapeno dip kills me because I am a baby with spice, but it kills me in a good wayn.  There are always suckers on the patio willing to bet my girly friend that she cant out chug them for drinks, and we ALWAYS be winning! Yeahhh!"
1,"This is my Go To Tailor. Her name is not Maple, its Michelle and she works wonders with her sewing machine. She has hemmed everything from evening gowns to expensive jeans for me and she has NEVER let me down. nnMost recently she has taken in a few pants and skirts that were too big and now they fit to perfection. Her prices are.....reasonable, I guess, but truth is I dont really care when it comes to taking care of my finer pieces. nnI have yet, to use their dry cleaning."
1,"Friendly service and fresh ingredients are the stars here.  I tried the special for the day, battered cod with  sides.  Our waitress explained that the cod was a fresh filet and hand battered.  I had it with steamed vegetables and clam chowder.  The clam chowder was also freshly made, and had nice large chunks of clam in it.  The chowder itself tasted a little too salty for me though.  The green beans were freshly steamed green beans, and they were a nice deep green color vs. the greyish mushy green beans you might usually see at restaurants.  nnService was excellent and drinks were refilled as needed.  Our waitress was very warm and friendly.  Sunnys Diner is hopefully here to stay for many years!"
1,"Hellers Kitchen is a very modern bistro located on Salisbury Place. I was drawn here by the cupcakes displayed in the window as they just looked so yummy, they were garnishes with various different colours of cream icing and many of them were topped with jelly beans. Yummy!nnMy friend and I decided to pop in for a bite to eat and we both went for a cup of tea and a cupcake each and they tasted just as good as they looked. The staff were very attentive and friendly and its an excellent place to chill out, the seats are very comfy and the lay out is fresh, vibrant and very inviting.nnIn addition to food, Hellers Kitchen also boasts a full bar which is well stocked and if youre looking for an afternoon or early evening tipple then why not, I wont tell anyone."
1,"I hate dealerships and I try to avoid them at any cost... But this place is a different story! After several lousy experiences at numerous other dealerships, I didnt want to come here but when it comes to my hubbys STI, I dont really have a choice lol. nnThe staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. Unlike other salespeople at other dealerships, when I say Im just here to look, and have no intentions of purchasing yet, They actually get it! They didnt keep pushing or try to persuade me in any way whatsoever. They still took their time to answer any questions we had and just said well, heres my card and whenever you decide youre ready, you got my number. Uhm... you rock!! The only thing that kept going through my mind was Awesome! Finally! a salesperson that actually has EARS and a BRAIN! Who wouldve thought that was possible?! nnNow, back to the STI... husband loves his car more than anything. I think his priority list looks something like thisn. STIn. Wifen. DogsnnEh, at least I come before the dogs... good enough for me. Anyway, back on topic... He occasionally comes here to purchase parts from Zenkai motorsport. If youre looking to modify your Subaru andor have any questions... Mike is your guy!nnI think well definitely be coming back here to purchase our next vehicle later down the road."

This is the place to pick up cute, trendy things at inexpensive prices literally most everything in the store is less than .   K.La features upandcoming new designers in an everchanging assortment.

1,"I had been going to the same dental office for many years, only because I liked my hygienist.  The dentists changed with the seasons and I wasnt really happy with any of them, so I found Dr. Wirth and decided to give him a try. Yeah me!nnDr. Wirth is not going to set the Scottsdale scene aflame.  I cant imagine him ever talking to me about cosmetic dentistry, but instead I get solid dental feedback, a dentist who listens and gets to know his patients.nnThe office is basic to look at, but they have all the latest digital tools and watery ultrasound drills.  My new hygienist really cares about her job and is chock full of tips.  The fact that I floss daily is a bonus for both of us!nnDr. Wirth approaches my mouth with a do as necessary attitude and it is just refreshing.  Best of all my husband likes him too, which is a major feat and a double check that I have chosen well.nnLet me just say my teeth are exceptionally important to me and I need them to keep eating and yelping!"
1,"We went today for lunch.  None of us had ever been.  My friends had the scallops with the mango salsa.  They did not comment on it...one way or another.  It looked good though.  I had the Kobe beef burger, it was really tasty, The waiter said...best burger you will ever get in a seafood restaurant.  I think he was right.nnI think next time I would like to try the brunch.  Seems like a great deal if you like cocktails...bottomless Mimosas, Bellinis or Sangrias...and lots of choices of fruits to mix in."
1,"I cant say whether or not Blue Nile is better than Lalibela.  They both seem to have their pros and cons, which dont necessarily have to do with the foods flavor, but more so personal preferences on texture, price Blue Nile is a bit pricier than Lalibela, and types of offerings Blue Nile seems to have a more extensive menu than Lalibela.  Personally, I prefer to flavor and textures of Blue Nile but not so much to pay the difference in price.  So, I would choose Lalibela over Blue Nile."
1,"Im in love with Mexican food, period. I travel quite a bit and always order the Carnitas Burrito and here Ive returned often to. Drive thru is a little tough to find, but the staff is always friendly, and visited them many a late nights. Thank guys!"
1,"I will update this as I try more from here but last night I just ordered one dish.  They are my corner thai joint so Im sure I will go back more.  nnI ordered the cashew stir fry which has dried chile in it but I asked for it spicier and I asked for broccoli with it.  Super plus they were very accommodating and didnt charge me extra.  The pick up was quick and easy and the portion was very large.  It was definitely spicy and there was lots of broccoli, my one side complaint would be that it had a bit too much fish sauce for a non fish dish.  But I will just make sure to ask them to tone it down on the fish sauce next time.  Other than that it was delicious and I quit enjoyed my meal."
1,"Ive been going to Dr. Tong for the past few years!  Hands down, hes the best!  So attentive and delicate w his procedures. Im usually a nervous wreck when seeing a dentist because I have this godawful gag reflex but Dr. Tong is very gentle yet skillful... Definitely makes me feel more at ease. I live in Irvine but make a point to see him onceyr when Im in Vegas!  Highly recommended!!!"
1,"Yoforia is delicious. I liked how I got to sample before deciding and I liked how cheap it turned out in the end. The Vanilla Bean was delicious. Pretty crammed most of the time I go by, but it didnt bother me a whole lot, other than the jumping in line and the little kids touching the machines pointlessly. No seating, but thats okay because its nice to just stroll around Southpark eating frozen yogurt at least for me.... Much better than Pinkberry because you make the decisions on quantity and toppings with much less trouble."
1,"Im a Carolina native, born and raised, but you cant get a better hot dog than a Chicago dog.  nnMatts Chicago Dog is serving up authentic ingredient Chicago Dogs to the uptown area is mass quantity!  Quality is supreme and the taste does not disappoint!  nnThe staff is friendly and professional and the establishment is always extremely clean, even during busy service.  its somewhat of a hike for me to do for lunch from far east Charlotte but its certainly worth the time!"
1,Pretty decent pizza in the Chandler area...you cannot go wrong with pepperoni....almost thin sliced and great sauce. The ambiance of this place is great with outdoor seating. On and it does have a decent wine selection...there pizza and wine....much better than pizza and beer. Just make sure to get  pizza for ....might as well get two of the large pizzas while you are at it.
1,"Top quality furnture  if you are looking for the best of the best, shop at Red.  Also, the owner is very nice, and is always willing to help.  Its worth a visit even if you arent considering making an actual purchase.  There are things there that you wont see anywhere else in this state."
1,"I would like to take a minute to thank Dr. Edwards and his amazing staff. I had gone to Dr. Edwards after hearing from a friend about the fantastic work he had done. I had  year old implants and one had ruptured and both had extreme calsifacration. I was a scared about what the options may be. I called his office and spoke to Kelly, she was a great first contact. She put my mind at ease, explained the initial process completely and sent the necessary paperwork to me via email, very easy. n After my first office visit I knew I had made the right decision. Meeting with Dr. Edwards put my mind at ease. He was kind, gentle and direct with answers to all my questions. The final presurgery details were made so easy by Jacqueline Walsh, she was caring and informative.n My surgery experience was just as amazing, it was relaxing and stress free. The postoperation follow up was just as Dr Edwards had explained, there were no  surprises or complications. n My results are amazing, I was completely satisfied with how full and natural I look. I absolutely recommend Dr. Edwards and his staff.     Vanessa"
1,"Bunky is a great little shop that you probably wouldnt find unless you were looking for it specifically, but would be happy to have found if you did. The owner Rachel who is super super cute, more than willing to answer questions and make suggestions, and is very knowledgeable about the area stocks her store with a lot of small label clothing mostly for women, some cool artistmade jewelry, cool fedoras and trilbys and other hats, and purses including HOBO brand.   There is a huge rack of cool tshirts too including kid robot which I think is pretty cool. nnSome of the pricing may seem a little high, but if you found a lot of the stuff she sells elsewhere, youd realize her pricing is really good. If youre in the area for First Friday or happen by another time, give this place a try."
1,"I was sad planning our Las Vegas trip a couple weeks ago, knowing that this place was closed. I had no idea why, but later found out that it was going to be open while we were in town. We planned the trip months in advanced, so I had time to plan my food destinations and this was one of the top ones on my list. I saw it on the food network and it combined two of my most favorite foods...Burgers and Pastrami! I had to try it!nnThe first thing I noticed walking in was the huge menu! I was overwhelmed by the amount of items that they had to offer and wanted to try everything! Of course I opted for the Pastrami Burger...a triple one! This thing was huge, but very, very delicious! I was so happy that I had a huge smile on my face after the first bite. My buddy and I also ordered the gyro fries, which was basically a gyro sandwich all on top of french fries! That alone was a meal in itself! The portions they serve are huge...and I eat a lot. I would highly recommend this place the next time you are in Las Vegas! I know Im going back and getting even more items to try next time!"

1,"It was my first time at a Suitsupply, and my expectations were high going in. I immediately was helped by THE Chris. The man has panache. Chris is so good that Im predicting he gets hired as Ryan Goslings private stylist by this time next year. He has a combination of elegance  precision in his work that would leave Jony Ive impressed. Needless to say, the guy sold me  suits and  blazers, which I couldnt be happier about.nnMy friend who came with me was helped by Taylor, who was equally as impressive. She was knowledgeable, spunky, and very pleasant work with. Huge snag by the folks at Suitsupply HQ. My understanding is that my friend left incredibly satisfied with the two suits she sold him, and may have possibly fallen in love during the process."
1,"We were searching for some good, inexpensive sushi around the area in Pittsburgh, and Ginza seems to meet those conditions. Fairly inexpensive, good ratio of ricestuff inside the rolls. Our only complaint is that the miso soup was a bit bland but not bad, and the shrimp tempura roll was a bit greasy."

1,"Of all the free, or adopt me kittens that Ive had, Ive never had to take them to the vet for any type of emergency.  nnBut then theres Leia....My cat Leia named like the princess she is, had to be taken in to the animal hospital on a Thursday just recently. She had been throwing up and not eating. We werent sure what was wrong with her. My boyfriend called Common Wealth and they took her in the same day. She had xrays, and the whole shabang. nWe were very lucky to have Dr. Clayton C. Watkins working on Leia. She was diagnosed with variant of inflammatory bowel disease, which made her lymph nodes swell up. They gave her medication to reduce the swelling, tube fed her until she ate on her own, and kept a good eye on her. After we paid, they recommended and even had the food she now has to eat on hand. Everyone was very friendly and kind, and loved Leia. After worrying about her for days I finally got her back today Monday  Shes so happy to be home, and were happy that shes doing well and will stay healthy.While it was scary at first it was an overall great experience.nWell be back in two weeks for a follow up!nnThank you Common Wealth Animal Hospital!"
1,"All About Serving just served my evasive ex husband whod already dodged a different process server Id served at least  times.  Their server was resourceful and clever in catching him and getting the papers served.nnNot only did they get the job done for me in less than  hours, but they picked up the papers from me within an hour of my inital call, took online payments which speeds up the process my last process server didnt and the delay sucked, a lot, they were courteous, professional and kept me informed of what was going on with my papers.  nnIm VERY pleased.  I highly recommend them."
1,"Ive known about Triple George Grill since , it came highly recommended by my friend Cinnamon Steen Fahey who used to be a showgirl back in the Rat Pack days she performed with Sammy Davis Jr in the s and Isaac shut yo mouth Hayes as well as numerous shows around the valley so you know she KNOWS Vegas....nnWell, fast forward almost  years later and we finally made it here..go figure, I even lived Downtown for a year and never made it. WHAT was I thinking?!? We definitely missed out not coming here earlier.nnSo we decided to have a staycation for the misters birthday got a room at the Downtown Grand and made dinner reservations at Triple George. I had done months of research on steakhouses all over Vegas..yeah we could have gone to one of the fancier ones on the strip but Im not that type of person I would rather support local as much as I can.  And the Downtown area has changed so much that the area around Triple George is just so much fun now.nnWalking in, I felt like I was back at Chics Place in San Francisco.  Well, I found out from our waiter that Triple Georges owner created it to be exactly like Tadich Grill in SF!  Our waiter was great, we talked about SF and about Maui where he is from service was top notch from the hostess down to the busboy.nnWe started with the baked goat cheese marinara appetizer, it came with lots of crostini and could easily feed  people.  Since we wanted to save room for our entrees, we had to stop ourselves from gorging on warm cheese and bread!nnThe mister ordered the porcini crusted ribeye and I had the petrale sole, both were delicious but I LOVED the ribeye...it was done a perfect medium rare and was like buttah!.  I loved it so much that I ate my fish and almost half of the misters ribeye!  The veggies that came with our entrees were nothing to rave about, but the star of the dinner was for sure the steak.nnWe finished off dinner with a complimentary chocolate cake with a birthday candle and a Irish coffee.  Overall, an outstanding evening!"
1,"Oh man.... prepare yourself for goodness!!nnI got a coupon from restaurant.com which is the only reason we found this gem. We were staying on the complete opposite end of the strip, so we are lucky to have made our way down here!nnDespite the  gift certificate, we had no illusions of a cheap meal. We had checked out their menu online and were prepared to pay. Which is a good thing!nnWe had a reservation on Friday night, and were promptly seated when we arrived. The wait staff was on it! While we had a main waitress, there were several others around who were quick to fill our wine glasses or remove an empty plate. nnIt didnt take long for us to order as we both new we were having steak. I ordered the Filet Mignon medium rare and my husband the New York strip medium with a lobster tail. We also ordered a side of Mac n Cheese and Spinach. nnBefore our meal, they brought out a sample of their duck fat fries. They were good, and we were presented with three varieties paired with a sauce. Im not sure I would order them again, only because the rest of the food was amazing!nnOur steaks were cooked to perfection! Cut with a fork they were so tender! While the two sides were way too much for two of us, they were a great accompaniment. We savored every bite!nnWe also ordered a  bottle of wine. That is way more than we usually pay for wine in fact, this whole meal was more than our biweekly food budget!, but it was awesome. Unfortunately we both drank too much of it to remember the name! Bottom line just let them pick the wine. They wont disappoint!nnWhile it was not needed, we indulged in the marscapone cheesecake. WOW. A perfectly light end to a great meal!nnOur total bill was about . Typically I would have been struggling to breath at that price, but not this night. Maybe it was the wine that had relaxed me, but I woke up the next morning still feeling good about the money spent. nnExcellent food, great service, well be back in  years when we can afford it again!"
1,"Francais aprues.nnI watched Anthony Bourdain No Reservation  Shanghai episode the other night and sortly after, a friend and I went just like that, unplanned. So the place looks sketchy like hell like a lot of asian restaurant. You can say that this place must have been a really classy dim sum place when it opened but its just so freaking outdated. But whatever, Decor only count when the food is ok. In that situation, the dim sums are quite amazing. For any neophyte, dim sums are the Asian version of Tapas. This is a mouthly of VAST BEAUTIFUL FLAVOUR! If youre white they might give you by instinct what I call the uabWhite peoples menuubb. Ask the Dim sum menu when being tabled. The price like any asian joint in Montrueal is ridiculous.  beers plus food for  persons when were only  and I got away from it for less than  with a generous tip of course. nI tried a lot of thing there even the beek tripes which is pretty ok, but I think asian has an acquired taste for chewy stuff. Otherwise my favorite things has the word shrimp or pork in it. They got some sooooooooliiiddd Shrimp Rolls. One tip...one of the waitress.the youngest of their staff which is not young! really will help you select if youre not confortable and she look like a person that has been there forever, so have a meal there with an open mind and an empty stomach yes yes like th chairman say. Last thing Quick service, cheap, good food, Super huge, great for the family orand friends. Pretty good for kids too. CLEAN BATHROOM, no Diharia! TMI I know...nnAprues avoir regarder luepisode a Shanghai dAnthony Bourdain No Reservation, jai vraiment eut envie dessayue les dim sums. Pas longtemps aprues, un colluegue qui terminait en mueame temps que je commenueais mon lunch sen allait diner rapido chez Rubis Rouge avant daller a ses cours. Cet endroit ue lair miteux et comme de nombreux restaurants asiatiques dans le quartier chinois, uea lair pas propre. Quand on rentre dans ce resto on peut facilement imaginer quue son ouverture, uea devait ueatre un palace de luxe dans un monde relativement pauvre. uc mon humble avis, le duecor compte seulement si la bouffe est moyenne ou ordinaire.  Pour les nueophytes, le Dim sums est le Tapas asiatique. Cest une petite bouchuee de SAVEURS EXTRAORDINAIRE Si ue larrivuee on vous donne un menu, vous verrez que cest un menu qui na aucun Dim Sum, jpense que cest le Menu des Blancs. Un genre de rueflexe de donner le menu de la bouffe quon mange. Enfin, comme tous bon resto dans le quartier chinois, cest la duecouverte dune aubaine! Pas plus de  pour  avec  biueres et un repas pour  avec un bon pourboire en plus. nnJai essayue plusieurs trucs jusquue date et mueame les tripes de boeufs. Pas mal caoutchouteux  mais je crois que cest un goufbt acquis chez les asiatiques, la textures est trues pruesente.  Un des meilleurs plats pour moi contient le mot crevettes. Les rouleaux aux crevettes sont gueniales  trues guenuereux en crevettes. Tous ce qui contient porc et crevettes chez Rubis Rouge mont vraiment plus.  nnSi vous y allez, une des serveuses relativement jeune par rapport ue la moyenne duege des employues, est vraiment bonne pour rediriger votre commande sil y a une incertitude dans la faueon de commander. Si vous recherchez un bon plat, elle vous recommandera avec une franchise anticorporative agrueable. elle naime pas un truc, elle le dit!. Le but cest vraiment dy aller avec une ouverture desprit et un bon appuetit. Petits dernier duetails le service est rapide, et cest peu cher. Les toilettes sont macculuees! Propres! Jnai pas eut de problueme digestifs aprues un bon lunch luebas, donc pour moi, cest un resto propre."
1,"Hawaiian food for the soul.nnEnvironmentnLocated on the second floor of the Cal. Its an open restaurant that has seating outside aka in the hotel walkway but small. Expect a wait on crowded weekends, especially tournament weekend! Order and pay, and they will deliver the food to you. They bus your tables for you.nnFoodnIve always loved their saimin, but this year I was sad that my saimin wasnt HOT. It was warm. The noodles were great like usual, but the broth tasted like tap water. Bummer. After I added my shoyu and hot mustard, I was in saimin heaven. We ordered a side of kim chee pass on this which was not good and probably out of a grocery store jar and a side of mac salad which was good BUT had too much mayo and was too salty for my liking. The mac salad had good texture, crunch, and color though. The portions are huge! My bro ordered the small saimin and it was comparable to a regular portion at any ramen house in socal. I ordered the chicken and tofu saimin and I think its served in a large bowl. The chicken was moist thigh meat? and the tofu was regular cooked tofu. The haupia was firm but the flavor was bland.nnWhy four stars?nNothing compares to my grandmas cooking, but if Im in Vegas, this is as good as it gets for Hawaiian food, especially saimin."
1,"My fiancee and I have seen this show a couple of times, and it is our favorite one!!  nnCreative, fun, great seats anywhere you sit because its in the round.  It is almost better to sit up in the second section to get a birds eye view of the entire production.nnWhen you sit really close, you are constantly turning your head left to right to see everything that is happening.nnThe roller skaters with big wooly mammoth boots on is my favorite part!nnGo see this show!!  Its legit!!"
1,"Coming from a tourists perspective, the inclines are mustsee when visiting Pittsburgh! Im fairly certain that we took em more than once because the views are gorgeous and its just a fun activity for anybody to do. nnIf you get the chance to go at night, do it! The lights are beautiful  theres an observatory area at the top!"
1,"Simply the best thrift store Ive ever been to. Well worth the   hour drive from my hometown.nnFirst, and foremost, EVERYTHING IS  off all of the time!nnSecondly, bring cash. They DO NOT accept credit cards.nnThe store is full of wonderful pieces of clothing, all arranged by color and type not by size, which is unfortunate. I found a wide selection of everything from casual pieces to highend business attire to supertrendy teen clothing... what surprised me most about this store was the QUALITY of the clothing. Almost all of the pieces were flawless, a few were worn or faded in some way and the price reflected that. Brand names were bountiful Banana Republic, Ralph Lauren, Chicos, Jones New York, Ann Taylor, American Eagle, HM. There were also some wonderful vintage pieces from the s, bright colors and crazy shoulder pads that would have made a more adventurous fashionista very happy indeed!nnThe clothing smells wonderful, not musty or dirty as in some thrift stores, and there was even a large selection of plussized clothing carefully culled out in a special section.nnI went to Red White  Blue to find some business attire for my new job, and came home with two gorgeous, flawless statement blazers from Ann Taylor Loft and Banana Republic... for a total of !nnCome to this thrift store itll make all other shopping obsolete!"
1,"I have been coming here since . My stylist is Anna Drew. She is wonderful. She takes her time, she has great skills. The vibe is wonderful, they have genuine pin up posters, and everyone there has character and enjoy what they do. nnTrust me. This is not typical hole in the wall salon. These people are happy, dedicated, skilled and up with the new and the old! They can do punk styles, classy up dos, and are very creative. I recently had my stylist do a classic A line for me, and I loved it. She added her own touch, which I really appreciated.  I traveled all over the country, from Las Vegas, to New York and to Miami, and paid for overpriced haircuts, and am really happy to have Shag me Salon right up the street from me. They charge me  for my simple hair cut, it includes a shampoo, and a movie  nnI recommended my boyfriends sister, and she is from the Bay area, she also had a haircut here and she was beyond satisfied and says she would return to get her haircut here again too.nnThe bonus is that Buffalo exchange is next door and a nail salon. So you can get dolled up for a night on the town all in one stop."
1,"Ive never been even remotely let down by Montys.  Is it busy a lot?  Yes.  Are you probably going to have to wait  minutes to sit down?  Yes.  Is the service slow because its so busy?  Yes.  Ive never been under the impression that the service is slow because theyre incompetent, but just because theyre busy.  Besides that, Ive never noticed it being especially slow... just kind of slow, which doesnt really bother me.nnLet me take a moment here to recommend the Meatloaf Sandwich Get it served cold.  Just trust me here.  Do not get it hot.  Ive had it served both ways Cold, it is a sandwich so delicious that fireworks go off in your head Warm, it is an openfaced abomination with gravy and mashed potatoes poured all over it.nnTheir cheeseburger was surprisingly good Id even go so far to say that its one of the best burgers Ive had in Madison.  They had a special entree one evening, Cheeseburger Mac  Cheese, which was out of this world.  It really tasted like a cheeseburger over noodles!  They serve a great chef salad, have awesome spicy waffle fries, and I would die  times over for the buttermilk biscuits they serve with breakfast.  Their expansive dessert case is as tasty as it is impressive looking.nnI was beyond sold on this place one time when I ordered a piece of german chocolate cake for dessert.  It wasnt a piece so much as it was a towering slab.  It was so tall, in fact, that it wasnt until Id eaten enough of it that I noticed that the waiter who was wearing a mohawk and kilt had written, Das ist Deutsch in chocolate on the plate.  nnIve had questionable service twice Once was when I reserved a pie for a dinner I was going to and they did not have it when I got there, but tried to placate me by selling me a larger, more expensive pie.  That was after I approached the counter and saw several staff members stare at me for  minutes before I was finally helped.  The other time was when I was there for coffee and dessert with friends, and we paid with a card.  The waiter told us, upon picking up the card, You know, if you can, you should really give me my tip in cash.  We dont see it on our paychecks for another  weeks otherwise.  Um...thanks for the advice on how we should tip you.  How about we dont tip you at all?nnBut those two experiences aside, nothing has been able to lessen my love of Montys and all its glory."
1,"Ive been wanting to try this place since it was Cave and Ives and I FINALLY made it there the other night. I REALLY enjoyed the place. Its got a REALLY great atmosphere with a nice patio and a fun, cheerful crowd.  They have a good selection of craft beers on tap, as well as wine and cocktails. I had their Ivan burger which was delicious, but HUGE.nnBeyond that, I had downed beers the rest of the night and had a good time. I must say that I wasnt overly crazy about the service. The bartender while reasonably efficient and polite wasnt the warmest or friendliest. It was pretty busy so I definitely take that into account but her attitude was noticeably contrary to the overall warmth and cheer of the place and the patrons which was disappointing.nnI am still down to come again because this is a fun place and I highly recommend it."
1,"I have stayed here twice in my life time and I enjoy it every time. Once in the casino tower and once in the paradise tower.  One of the major reason why I enjoy it is because everything you need in Vegas is right in the hotel. You would never need to leave. No it is not on the strip but walking the strip can be overrated. When I stay here the club is awesome, the restaurants, mostly pink taco is awesome, the gambling is awesome, the hotel itself is awesome, the employees are nice and the pools are awesome. nnOnly issues I have ever had is room service getting out meal completely messed up, which they comped us for, and sometime you can hear to music from the pool area at  am. When I want to sleep in the last thing I want to hear is Snoop Dog. nnThe rooms are clean. It doesnt smell like smoke like some of the other hotels do.  They have a Starbucks which is real nice. And they have an awesome players club where you can win prizes. I am only about . away of game play time until I earn that Hard Rock Hotel min backpack. HA HA. nnWhatever you do Whatever though do not touch the mini fridge. It is on a weight system and if you even touch it then they charge you a gross amount of money which is ridiculous. That is my only grip so I dont touch it not even when I am drunk and I really want to. nnSo I like the Hard Rock and have turned many of my friends onto the hard rock. If you like Vegas but are getting tired of the strip defiantly give this place a go."
1,"I came here for a weekend out with one of my girlfriends.  We chose Palms Place because we wanted to avoid some of the drunken and rowdy crowd you will see at the Palms.  nnService here was awesome.  The bellhop who helped us remembered our names not just the day we checked in, but during our entire stay.  nnWe had a studio suite, and I remember walking in and thinking wow, I would want to live here.  It had a mini kitchen not really used except to chill our alcohol, as well as a seating area where we could relax.  We had a nice view of the strip, too.nnWe decided to hit the pool at the Palms, and that was a bit of a walk.  Our desire to avoid some of the madness meant we had a  minute walk to get from Palms Place to the Palms itself.  Not too bad when youre wearing flip flops, but quite another thing when youre dressed and ready to go out.  nnOverall, I would definitely recommend staying here to anybody who is interested in staying off the strip.  There are lots of young, hot people hanging around by the pool and in the casino itself, so you dont even need to head over the strip itself if you dont want to."
1,"Great old school barber shop.  There around  barbers here, so the lines go fast.  As a guy with super thick and straight or curly under a microscope hair, the littlest imperfection shows up immediately.  Marco hooked me up and made sure my fade was right.  He also did the razor line up right.  The haircut is superb, and I highly recommend coming here.  nn stars for the haircut.nnThe only downside is that the barbers dont speak English to each other, so I didnt understand anything said.  The atmosphere is definitely loud and upbeat, but I just didnt know anything there were talking about.  Another thing, my haircut was  although the wall advertised .  Whatever, Im not a stickler for  bucks, but it definitely will affect the review.  It could have been something lost in translation, but I was extremely happy with the haircut.  nn stars for atmosphere.nn star experience overall.  This will be my regular place from now on."
1,"This is a StateoftheArt Frys Marketplace that provides everything you think you might need...and more!  There is a gigantic Kosher foods section titled Kosher Experience, opening Jews and Goyim alike to delicious Israeli and Glatt Kosher foods.nnThis Frys doesnt discriminate.  If you want to be a fatass, you can spend hours shopping at the snacks and soda sections!  If youre passionate about all things organic and vegan and whatnot, its right in the front so that your anorexic self can prevent yourself from fainting on the journey to the center of the store.  If you live off of TV dinners, this is your place!  If you want a fresh snack to eat, you can get it here too!  Do you like samples?  Frys will let you sample one of its weirdo experimental salads Grape salad?? to try.  Sure they arent the best, but hey, theyre friggin free samples!nnDo you want to buy a whole loaf of bread and dont want to cut it yourself?  They have a BREAD CUTTING MACHINE that you can use!nnWhat is amazing about the Shea x Tatum Frysa serious gem of a Frys, an oasis, a beacon of hopeis that the low prices Frys is wellknown for doesnt change one bit! nnI cant go to this Frys without spending at least an hour and a half in there.  Its worth it because you can get gas rewards for shopping there.  The managers specials actually help you double the points because youre willing to risk your life to buy almost expired food for  of the original price.  They reward you for your ability to take risks.  Can I get a hallelujah!???!?!??!nnFIVE STARS!!!!!!"
1,"I started shopping here many years ago and then didnt have a need for quite awhile.  But, now our son plays soccer, and we like some of the other gadgets they have, weve now been here quite a few times.  nnWe also appreciate they give us no hassle on things we need to return, which makes it easy, unlike places like Walmart that sometimes is a pain to return things to.nnTheir selection of some kids items like soccer cleats were not as good as the Val Vista store, however, customer service and everything was super!!!  You guys give us great service and we appreciate it!"
1,"I could swear the weights werent this heavy before...Ok, I havent been here for a while  but Ive been a member for years and even though I have only one check in here, the reason could be for the fact that the last time I was here I was wearing a beeper, but now Im planing to be more consistent with my exercise routine, Im hoping my doctors health warning will be stronger than my willpower.nI really like this gym, theres ample of safe lighted parking, the facility is always kept clean and the employees are nice and helpful. You can find the newest equipment available, treadmills, weight machines, and free style weights,  they also have aerobic, spinning or many other classes, public or private. The facility also counts with clean locker rooms and clean towel service, there is also a snack bar where you can recover from a hard workout with a delicious drink.  You can count on Alexis the bar attendant to recommend something good for whatever your needs are, he makes some killer protein shakes!  n I will be coming back to this location since it has everything I need....... as soon as I get new gym clothes, I wish someone would have told me that my white and red stripe aerobic shorts and headband were out of style before I walked into the gym."
1,"I was really craving some Asian noodles, so after seeing the Blue Man Group we headed over to give this place a try. We waited about  minutes, which isnt too bad. nnOur server was very friendly and helpful. The atmosphere was decorated to fit the theme and was very inviting.nnI ordered the wonton soup with thin rice noodles, and the boyfriend ordered the chicken soup with flat rice noodles. The prices were pretty decent, about  per person for what we ordered. nnOur dishes came quite quickly but to our disappointment they tasted pretty bland. We let our server know and she brought over some soy sauce, chili sauce, and some salt and white pepper. After adding in the seasonings the soups were delicious! My boyfriends chicken was moist and tender, and the shrimp wantons in my soup were wonderful!nnWe would definitely come back here next time were in Vegas!"
1,"I made a stop there last night.  I wasnt really expecting much.  The place is not really near any traffic.  Ive been craving Cuban food for a while now, but since my first and last awful experience at Florida Cafe last year maybe it was time to try something new.  The place looks very mysterious from the outside since the windows are covered in graphic art but when I walked in, you could sense the mom and pop atmosphere.  nI started with the queso soup, which turned out to be just ok.  For my meal I opt for the oxtail stew.  Ive had oxtail plenty of times, but when my platter came out...I got flanked with flavor.  The meat was so tender the bone kept falling off. The rice was surrounded by fried sweet plantains that left me no room for dessert.nI left happy, but will return hungry."
1,"Awesome concertevents venue, nearby a five star resort, shopping centers, recreation center and award winning parks and trails.  If you want to enjoy live and cheap concerts in the great outdoors, then you must check out this venue, I would highly recommend this."
1,I went here tonight with my dad and it was cute! We had a pretzel for an appetizer and it was really good but little small. We both had the salmon and it was very good! Reasonably priced..The sandwiches looked awesome..Id try it again
1,"Had a pretty good experience with Hertz compared to how I know it could have gone! The only real complaint with the service was the wait we experienced when arriving at the counters. They had  folks working but it seemed like each transaction was taking FOREVER. This was pm though, so maybe folks were tired or customers just werent prepared with confirmations? I dont know... half an hour or so later we were searching for our car in this large parking garage full of rentals. I would have appreciated some mention of the gps upon check in and knowing if it was going to cost us something to use it. instead of risking it, we just turned it off each time we got in the car... nnOne irritating thing, since we had valet at our hotel, was that our car had no popper button for the trunk in the cab or on the remote and wed have to turn the ignition off to get our luggage out, but Im sure its just a safety feature so anyone breaking into the car cant get into the trunk so easily.nnThere are a couple gas stations really close to the rental facility, so we filled up on our way back and had the smoothest and quickest return experience I think Ive ever had. A woman met us at the car, denoting mileage and checking the car over and that was it! nnOverall, had a fine experience with Hertz using our Entertainment Book discount"
1,"stars  not like any zoo youve ever been to.  This is the closest you will ever get to wildlife without going to Africa.  Definitely not cheap, but there is a  for  coupon in the Entertainment book.  Try to smuggle in some snacks and drinks because food is also pricey.  All in all, a big thumbs up."
1,Great place to see the fountains but this is definitely not a club. There was a cover band playing when we were there which then became a DJ later in the night. The crowd is definitely on the older side. Id say the average age was . Come here to see the fountains and such but thats about it.
1,"Came here because of all the great reviews that it got from the fellow yelpers. My boyfriend and I were craving crepes for awhile and didnt want to spend  bucks on a fancy crepe place so we came here. I was very surprised how delicious they were! I got the savory crepe with turkey and everything in it and my boyfriend got the deli crepe. The savory crepe is huge and can be shared. The deli crepe wasnt as good, and didnt think that it would be cold. Im not sure if I would get that again. I will come back and try the waffle sandwich and if my tummy has room, a dessert one as well as. Love the interior and the staff is friendly. Btw, they have a stamp card too, so make sure you ask for one!!"
1,"I live in London, another mecca of Indian food. But Edinburgh? You might have us beat. Theres a lot to choose from.nnWe had Ceylon chicken, naan, pilau rice, lamb jazfrezi and those crispy pancake things with chickpeas in the middle. I forget the name. But that was awesome. Ran us about ua. I didnt find anything too spicy. nnWhatever curry you choose, DEFINITELY get the naan, it is quite light and fluffy yet crisp and flavourful."
1,"Best Urgent Care around.  I am always in and out quickly with great service.  I dont let my family go anywhere else!  The staff is amazing, perfect combo of kind and efficient.  CVS is next door as well if you need to pick up a prescription as well."
1,"I know, I know Im somewhat of a hypocrite, dont smoke cigarettes but I will smoke a hookah once, twice a year maybe With that being said nI have always enjoyed myself at Hkahn, they have a vast variety of flavored tobacco and endless alternatives to add to the base. The establishment is very cozy and the food is quite good, they also have a decent beer selection Lancaster strawberry wheat on tap!, add all of this together and it results in a consuming evening which also adds up to big bucks. Weve been known to drop  in one night."
1,"We stop here every time were in town! My fiancue and I love the macaroni grilled cheese best idea ever! and the daily specials are always creative and delicious. We have a  month old baby and they always pull out an abacus to keep him entertained  he also loves the s music and the colorsorted vintage candy displays  nThe owner is always decked out in s gear and is the sweetest, most welcoming chick ever. This place is a total gem in the Arcadia area."
1,"I had never heard of Fresh  Easy before it was built up the street from my house.  Everytime I drove by, I thought it was a either a healthfood store selling organic tofu cereal, and like products, an expensive frufru snittysnotty gourmet foods store out of my  league, and I have a year old, or an expensive healthfood gourmet store.  Either which, none of them were apealing to me as Im a carnivorous motherwife who doubles as  an elementary school teacher in my spare time. None of those labels makes shopping at a specialty store easy.  Keyword EASY.  I need easy.  Wait, cheap and easy.  nnFor some reason my family and I ventured into Fresh  Easy, and from the moment my skeptical eyes hit the fresh fruit section, they were in love.  Packaged lovengly into small, easytoopen plastic containers were my and my familys favorite fruits fresh ripened mangos, sliced pineapples, strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, and more.  Just the fresh mango chunks alone was enough to immediately sell me on the place.  Oh, and the fact that the small container of mangos cost under  was a definite bonus. nWe had only been down the produce aile moments when we ended up at the first turn and right into the arms of the Sampler Lady.  Camped out at the end of the produce aisle stood the sampler lady waiting for us, armed with an assortment of deliciouslooking morsels that represented every meal  breakfast, lunch, snack, dinner, dessert, drink..... all there, delicious and accounted for.  I immediately felt like hugging her, but resisted.  She kindly explained each food item and directed us to where in the store we could find each one.  Ingenious!  What a great idea!  Open up a box of your product, cook it up, serve it to the customers so that theyll try it, like it, and want to buy it!  Why didnt anyone else think of this??  Not only was the dinner she had cooked up delicious, it was DIFFERENT.  We had tried a savory Thai curry with rice chicken medley. I had to have it!  Our guide escorted us over to the premade meal section where we were giddy to find all sorts of meals  Thai, Italian, Mexican, Vegetarian, traditional American, and more! Even better, they were packaged to feed approximately  people or one hungry person, or two adults and a small child.  When you have a family of , like ours, its hard to buy premade meals unless you want to always have leftovers.  nTo add on to my glee, the meals were so reasonable.  Delicious, inexpensive, gourmetlike meals that make me look like a rockstar mom and wife.  I loved this store.nnAs I floated up and down the aisles, I noticed that there werent that many at all aisles.  Not only that, the product selection was very small, but not to a fault.  It made me realize just how much of my shopping experience is spent making difficult choices from muchtolarge selections.nnFresh  Easy is a great store with great staff... I havent even gotten to them, but thats a whole other review.  I have no idea where they find these people, but whereever it is... it must be a nice place, bec ause the staff is amazingly nice and helpful.  nnJust go there.  Drive past all the other silly grocery stores, and visit your local Fresh  Easy.   Youll be so happy you did."
1,"Sunday brunch on the patio, before hitting the pools. nFor . I got huevos rancheros, a fruit plate, pastry basket, AND bottomless mimosas!nAnd yes, we took full advantage of the term bottomless! I had  and my boyfriend had  before we went down to mandalay beach for a day in the sun. nMy huevos rancheros were good, not the best Ive ever had, but still quite tasty. My boyfriend had chicken enchiladas from the same . brunch menu and they were great, I loved the flavor of the guajillo sauce. nIve been here once before with friends for margaritas and apps before a concert, but Id say brunch is way better! ncheck it out!nhttpwww.bordergrill.comPDFBGLVBrunchFlyerFlyer.pdf"
1,"I love this old Las Vegas landmark. Ive been going there for many years. It is a steakhouse the way Las Vegas used to be. Its a couple hundred feet off the strip on Sahara. If you like a big traditional steak, this is the place for you.n    I dont think Ive ever had bad service there. Ive always left happy."
1,"Knowing I was going to be in Scottsdale today around lunch . . . I decided to find something different for lunch . . . and The Herb Box looked like it would . . . and it did not disappoint.nnWe first ordered our drinks and the Crisp Falafel Bites . . . they were to die for . . . crisp and warm . . . with herb roasted tomatoes and a variety of olives . . . to be honest . . . I could have eaten the whole order myself . . . and the passion fruit black iced tea . . . clear crisp and cold . . . the perfect pair.nnFor my entruee . . . the butternut squash corn enchiladas . . . it came with a roasted tomato verde salad . . . which perfectly offset the richness of the enchiladas.  They were warm and the corn mixed with the butternut squash wrapped in a corn tortilla . . . was so rich and creamy and delightfully packed with flavors.nnThe atmosphere was relaxing . . . so much so . . . that I almost forgot that it was a work day . . . I will definitely be back . . . and I might even surprise my wife, and bring her back here for dinner."
1,"Love this place! If you have not tried this out yet definitely do so! Perfect for the hot AZ summers.nnI have tried the Mango with Chile, Roasted Pecan, Strawberry Cream, Orange Cream, and the Watermelon with Mint. All were fantastic. My favorite flavor really is the one that I am eating at the moment. They are all that good. nnBTW if you decide to sit down and eat your popsicles in the store, their water cooler is always filled with different fruit flavors! The last time I was there it was strawberry and orange flavored water. Genius!"
1,"Our visit was on .  And, I would have to agree with Anna K.s  review below.  The setting is spectacular.  Service impeccable.  Absolutely perfect if you want to get away from the noise, congestion and overall ickyness of the strip  stories below.  nnWe stopped at the Mandarin Bar to have a cocktail before we ate at Mozen.  We ordered a bottle of Sake and, after tasting how delicious it was, determined that we didnt want to rush through our bottle.  The problem is that I like to be on time and didnt want to be late for our dinner reservations.  I could feel the anxiety building. nnAlmost as if he could read my mind, the bartender asked if everything was okay.  I told him that if we enjoyed this bottle of Sake we clearly were going to be late for our dinner reservations.  nnThe Bartender smiled and said, No Problem. I will be right back.  In a moment, he returned and told us he had spoken to the restaurant and we could enjoy our Sake as long as we would like and our table would be ready whenever we came downstairs.  Excellent!  All my anxiety disappears and we enjoy the drinks, view and each others company.nnHowever, be prepared to pay for the ambiance, service and overall Ahhh factor.  Being a Rockstar does not come inexpensively.  But here, for my spouse and I on this night, it was worth it.  Thank you."
1,"Yep.  It was that great!nnService was flawless  immediate refilling of glasses before they were below half full, waitress heard me comment about temperature and immediately offered a sweater which was needed, drinks were quickly brought to the table and my mixed drink was described with a few extra details to ensure its what I was wanting.nnFood was perfectly, and I mean, PERFECTLY cooked.  Grabbed some of the peppercorn sauce for my smashed garlic potatoes.  While the taters definitely stood on their own, Im glad to have had the crazy delish gravy to douse my potatoes with.  The veggies of a single carrot and snow peas were cooked fine, but being a veghead, Id have wished for a lot more.  Regardless, my filet, potatoes, and veggies were more than enough for an overthetop gluttonous meal!nnThe manager stopped by the table to make sure everything was to our liking and cooked correctly.  Even valet was seamless with the experience.nnBased on some of the reviews, I was concerned wed find our steaks underseasoned, and I even thought about asking for extra seasoning.  Alas, it was absolutely perfect as is.nnDefinitely a splurgeworthy meal!nnBonus the happy hour offers discounted cocktails and free steak sandwiches...we didnt imbibe since a steak sandwich before my steak meal seemed a bit overthetopfatassAmerican."
1,"Pool tables. Shuffleboards. College Football games galore. And of course, plentiful pours of the Malibu Rum  a great spot for fun times!!! And did I mention Sundays they have free pool from pm to close?? Wow!!! Plus Duke is from Montana. Double the star rating!!!nnBonus points for their car service when you get a bit tipsy"
1,Cant say enough good things about this small ThaiCambodia restaurant. Great food good service  try the Tom Yum soup   It is delicious. Will be back soon for sure. Ginger chicken and red curry were awesome. I hope they franchise.
1,"Bar Vdara is a great place to come and people watch or laze around until you really hit the hot spots in City Center or on the Strip.  Located right in the hotels lobby, we opted to hang out at Bar Vdara as one last stop before we caught a cab and left.  The atmosphere is wonderful but the service could use a little work.  Our waitress wasnt very personable or friendly and took a long time to even get us a drink menu.  Once we ordered our drinks, they came out timely and were pretty good.  Nothing exceptional about the specialty cocktails but the ambiance is key.  Hope you get a better waitress than we did!"
1,"Pro Anna in the Fireside Lounge, the fire pit in the fireside lounge, cool rose decor in the fireside lounge, did i mention Anna? nnCon Slightly over price food in the Peppermill Restaurant, crazy lights in the Peppermill, so so food. nnWent to the Peppermill due to overwhelming good personal recommendations and of course Hazels review. Not to mention the Rose Bowl was going and we needed a place with big screen to the watch the game. nnSo, Peppermill it is and thank you god for that place. nnThe hostess told us that the Lounge only have starters, so we planned on drinking and watching for a bit with a sampler, then head back to the restaurant for food during half time. nnWe walked into a rose vine covered Lounge with the bar on the right and watery fire pits on the left, flat screen and semi circle couches are all over the place. The lounge server was Anna, a dark hair Romanian beauty that looks like a cross of Rachel McAdams and Lauren Graham but hotter, younger, with longer legs. Yes, I know I shouldnt be reviewing this place based on her, but it is that golden sunset at your Malibu mansion that sets your place apart to other locations. nnThe food and drinks were a flowing, everything worked out with pretty good service. Then we left at half time for food, which just was a bit overpriced but it is very good. Service was prompt and Silviyas suggestion on the omelet are a great one. Milk shake and carrot cake were pretty right on the spot. nnOverall, if you are in Vegas, go see Anna in the Lounge for business meeting or to chill with friends. Food, you can save more money going to somewhere else, but probably not as good."
1,"Ive lived in Phoenix for two years, and Spa Lamar is now one of my very favorite places.nI just went there for the first time today and got a  minute Swedish massage, done by Christina. She is magnificent! I was uberstressed when I went in, after weeks and weeks of stressful stuff Ive had to deal with. She adjusts her pressure to make sure youre getting the most out of your massage, and she just plain knows what shes doing. Ive had massages that were bafflingly subpar. Not this one!nnAfterward, I laid on a blowup raft in the swimming pool, and was hypnotized by the sound of the little waterfall. Im surprised someone else on here thought the pool was like a cheap motel pool. Its small, but I thought it was beautiful. Kind of a Tuscany feel.nnThe people were nice, the gift shop was very interesting. Lots of cool books and jewelry and Tshirts. Oh, and the complimentary gourmet granola bars were yummy.nnI plan to go back and highly recommend Spa Lamar! After a rough few weeks I left there feeling like a human again, and my neck had released the boulders that were there before!"
1,Here it is short  sweet.......GARLIC CHICKEN with xtra gravy!!!! It is the best I have had. Portions are generous and prices are reasonable. The adobo can be on the salty side sometimes but is good. The Adobo Fried Rice Omelet though is........... OOOOOOONNNNNNOOOO!!!! You have to try for yourself. They only get  stars cuz they no can make up da mind where dey goin build in CA. Hurry Up!!!!
1,"I took two sushi fans here for the first time and we had an amazing experience!  The food and service were outstanding!nWe got there right around am on a weekday, and shortly there after the place started to fill up!nI also recommend the call in and pickup...they took about  min to make my rolls!"
1,"This is a perfect sized music venue, in my opinion. Id rather drown in the sweat of a small crowd than be lost in a sea of people, or worse yet, swimming in a large open space with small schools of humans lingering in separate pools. Here, no matter how many people show up, the energy of the show is palpable and contained. The sound has been nearly great, in my experiences, which puts Club Cafe well above and beyond most other venues insert more water metaphors here. I think Club Cafe looks really cool from the outside but doesnt feel too cool ie. pretentious inside and actually lacks character, making it a nice neutral space to suit any genre. But its pretty rare for them to book shows that are of interest to me, so I dont necessarily follow or monitor their schedule. Service is efficient, but sometimes the drinks are weak, and I really hate going to the Southside."
1,Came here while in town for a country concert.  What better way to start our day.  Everything was great.  The service was amazing from the time we walked in the door.  We were sat at a table and to our surprise there is a beer and whiskey tap at the table.  You pay by the ounce and there is a screen to show you what youve drank.  The food we had was great.  The whiskey burger was my favorite.  For you country fans this is a must when in Scottsdale!
1,"The trick with Great Clips is finding a stylist who works with what you like. I like fun, edgy haircuts, and Malia is perfect for those. She has given me pixie cuts, assymetrical cuts, and notsuperpainful growing out my hair trims and they always look fantastic. I am complimented frequently on my hair, and people are always shocked to hear that I go to Great Clips. I have only had Malia cut my hair at this location, but she is friendly, professional, and always does what I ask her to or when I come in and say I dont know, just make it cute, she still rocks something nice for me."
1,"Friday after pm free nights? also Saturdays for now Of course this is a major incentive to visit a museum!nnThis one has a good size and the chance to watch different expositions. Always changing, always showing new artists at least for me. This is a good excuse to go out last minute and have a refreshing night."
1,"The sandwiches are large and even include the fries INSIDE it! Not usually a fan of coleslaw, but theirs is quite good. Not overwhelming in flavor, just enough to make it a unique addition to the sandwiches. Dont be surprised when you get the sandwich and theres no plate that comes with it. Worth a stop when you get a chance!"
1,Excellent place to go for lunch!  One line for salads and another for sandwiches.  I got a cobb salad to go and it was REALLY good!  All of the ingredients were fresh.  The service as fast.  I will go here again the next time Im in Charlotte downtown to work.
1,"As this Peckhams is right down the street from where I work, Ive opted for a bite to eat and a glass of wine here a handful of times, as well as the staff Christmas night out twice.  nnIt might be the time of day, but every time Ive been here there havent been many full tables which never fails to confuse me because of where it is located and its tasty grub.  To me, this is the perfect place to head for a drink and a bite to share after work because they have a great variety of antipasti platters and a good selection of drinks.  I think maybe the problem is the fact that is really is set up like a restaurant and feels just a bit formal for postwork drinking.nnThe two Christmas meals Ive had here have been standard, but when a chef is churning out  meals at once to a table full of drunk academics, no one is really bothered by a bit of dry turkey.  nnOverall, Peckhams Underground has good food, excellent service, and good drinks in a relaxed atmosphere.  A must visit when in Bruntsfield."
1,"Loved Postrio!  My halibut was cooked to perfection crispy on outside, moist on the inside.  Accompanying vegetables peas, mushrooms rounded out the dish perfectly.  Fellow diners enjoyed their Caeser salad, steak skewers, and Caprese salad.  The fresh mozzarella was divine.  I expected the angels to sing from the fauxcloud ceiling above.  nnExcellent service too!  Thanks guys for making a memorable experience."
1,"My brother, wife and kids were in town and spotted this as we drove and bombarded me with questions. It was good the last time I went, but it wasnt impressive that I was dying to go back. I was dreading a very ridiculous wait, but they said  minutes and it seemed like we got seated sooner than that. I guess in the recent year theyve really ironed out their efficiency since our orders came swiftly was well.nnOrdered shrimp, crawfish, and clams in HNJ sauce, andouille sausage in hot butter, and one in lemon butter, half a dozen raw oysters, and rice. Ive never been a fan of crawfish since its a whole lot of shell for a little bitty nub of meat. The shrimp was big, juicy and perfectly cooked. The clams were pretty good but a few had a bit of sand still. I guess thats just a typical hazard with shells. After trying the sausages in other sauces, I still prefer the HNJ as my sauce spicy and garlicky good. I was a tad miffed last time I came here with  rice being a piddly scoop they made the serving bigger which they should. Asians rejoice!  My family liked this place so thats good. Sometimes being a Yelper everyone thinks you know ALL the things and I feel pressure being different in food taste too. nnService was great. Very friendly, checked on us often, fast about getting things. I really think the staff here has finally figured out a groove. Only helps them to faster turnover.nnOf course this is a messy experience, but if you dont like getting your hands all garlicky and seafood smelling, you can request gloves! My nephew wanted gloves so his hands dont smell. They give you bibs of course but this isnt the spot to wear something nice to and avoid long sleeves like white button downs. Cracking shells is a splatter hazard. nnYeah, this place is hyped to hell and I dont think is the greatest thing to happen to seafood like people make it out to be, but it is solid if you just want simple, fresh seafood. Sometimes clambake style food just hits that spot. If only it came with a sea view, I would feel complete."
1,"Authentic, delicious.  If you like spicy Chinese food this is the place for you!  There are dishes that are not spicy also, but Szechaun cuisine is all about the heat!  This region specializes in spicy food.  If you dont like spicy, or cant handle it, I understand but youre missing out.  Definitely coming back here."
1,Dr. Majidi is an awesome chiropractor. He is so personable. He always remembers me  who I am...not one of those things where your doctor makes a couple notes to lookup before they see you. He genuinely remembers almost everything I tell him from where I work out to whats happening at work to my dog etc...you can tell he really cares about his clients. He always gives great advice about exercise diet etc...without saying hey you should make a nutriton appt with me. He gives advise on the places to workout based on what youre looking to do what to take before and after working out etc...and since Ive been seeing him regularly the pain I was getting is gone. Jessica is great too  is a great massage therapist. If you need a chiro definitely go see Dr. Majidi
1,"I actually swore off subway for awhile after I moved here from GA. Not because I didnt like subway anymore, but because on the  day drive here,  I think we ate subway for nearly EVERY meal. Apparently truckers LOVE their footlongs. P By the time we got here, I was absolutely sick of subs, and fast food in general, really. nFinally the craving for a tasty sandwich came back, and off to subway I go. Tastes just as good as I remember. This location was clean, the service good, the vegetables fresh, and they even had spinach, which is something that you dont find as often back home. Perhaps all the subways here have spinach, but I wouldnt know. nOnly thing that I didnt like, was that they didnt have sliced Monterrey cheddar, only shredded. Weird."
1,"I wish I still lived in Ballantyne because I havent found a place as good as this one in uptown or north Charlotte.nThey have the largest collection of colors Ive seen at any nail salon their OPI  Mod About you is my favorite! Their prices are extremely reasonable   for a polish change! The inside is clean and roomy and the staff is really nice and friendly. I have come here just before closing time a couple times and theyve still willingly accommodated me. nAlthough all of their staff is skilled, I still recommend getting one of the men to do your nails since they are the most skilled of the lot. Ironic huh?"
1,"Ive been coming here consistently since the place opened up. Its such a great atmosphere and place to hang with friends. I really appreciate and enjoy the amenities this place includes wifi password written on the menu board, blankets to sit outside when its cold, heaters outside, its open til am most nights, and the waiters bring your order to you.nnI wouldnt say they have the strongest coffee, but I usually end up getting their sweet lattes and desserts anyways."
1,"Really fantastic holeinthewall. What makes this place is the addons  I had the wasabi mayo and dried tomato sauces, the former which gave the burger an incredibly unique flavor. I opted out of cheese, but I think brie or gouda would have been really interesting. Creative and delicious."
1,"Im new to the area and discovered this place on accident. Ive been to both locations and they are both fantastic! Ive lived here  months and been probably  times already. The food is fantastic, Ive ordered a few things on their menu and its always good but I tend to eat most of my husbands pastaits a simple dish but its the best pasta Ive ever had. The customer service here is great too! I went to this location a week or so ago and ordered the tomato soup as an app without realizing there was goat cheese on it so I had to send it back Im pregnant and the waiter was so gracious about it! We told him why and at the end I also ordered a dessert which came with flakes of brandy or some kind of alcohol so he warned me just in case! The prices here are also very reasonable. When I could drink the mojitos are very good! So far its my favorite place in Charlotte and weve been to quite a few!"
1,"These yogurt places are all the same to me. You get your flavors and load up on toppings and they charge you based on how greedy you are, aka by weight. nnRazzy Fresh does have a pretty awesome selection of fresh fruits and such for your yogurt which I feel is what other Yogurt places dont have as much of. Now Im a fat kid so thats not a big pull for me I would rather have the candy and cake bits for mine but I can see how that would be an advantage for others."
1,"Best night FRIDAY. They are known to be the club to go to on Friday night. nnI might be pampered because I have an amazing promoter who takes care of my party but I can say this is the club to go to at least once if you are in Vegas. Like anywhere in Vegas, always easier with a larger ratio of girls. There are two lines guestlist line and all girl line. Admission I believe is ? nnDownstairs is the restaurant and a barlounge area. Upstairs is where the club is at and is two levels second level has tables and the restrooms. Music is good and I know TAO is known to be the asian club but the three times I have been to Vegas and at TAO, the crowd is pretty diverse. I always have a great time here."
1,"I love the Mirage! I stayed here the night of my st birthday, then  years later, I returned with my sister, brother, and husband for their th birthday. nnWe stayed in a king suite, which was absolutely gorgeous. The bed was super comfy, full length mirrors, and a great radio with iPodiPhone hookup, which is awesome. Like anywhere is Vegas, dont mess with the mini bar.... Outrageous prices. Go across the street to the liquor store and grab some water, liquor and snacks. nnThe pool is awesome. I love the waterfalls and the big open concept bThey have multiple poolside bar and grilles, and tons of chairs. We laid out towels on front row  chairs early around or  am?, and nobody messed with them. Tip the servers and they will not forget about you. They did not check our bags as we came in, so naturally, we brought in flasks and mixers. They have representatives from Bare topless option adult pool who annoy the heck out of you, but a firm NO, and they will back off. nnThe casino is clean and nice, with  minimums on the tables during the day, with only one or two tables per game of  min in the evenings. We checked out Revolution the Beatles lounge for free and ladies got at least two free drinks. The Sports Bet is decent per my husband, but drink servers are scarce. We got a  voucher to use at CPK for signing up for the M Life rewards card. Pretty sweet. nnUnfortunately, the room keys did not always work. My sister had to call the front desk at least  times throughout the weekend sometimes after a long night! and had to wait  minutes for a staff member to come open her door. Also, internet and cell  service sucks. Like really, really sucks. nnI would visit the Mirage again. Great location, nice and modern rooms, amazing pool scene and a legit casino level."
1,My boyfriend and I live about  minutes away from this place so we are frequent patrons. We love it!!! Have always had awesome food. It comes out fresh and the portions are generous! I love the eggplant and the greek salad. The boy loves...everything. Their hummus... I crave it all the days! Absolutely recommended!!
1,"Amazing food, amazing service, and amazing atmosphere!  Highly recommend the green chili cheeseburger, the green chili mashed potatoes, and the crab stuffed peppers were to die for!  Will definitely be eating here A lot!!!"
1,"This is one of the smaller lees stores but i would say its one of the best!  It is definitely the cleanest store.. They have an awesome selection of beer,wine, and liquor. If they dont have what youre looking for, the friendly staff can order what your looking for.  The only thing that sucks is this douche bag named garret that works there."
1,We come here when I dont feel like cooking Filipino food myself and have a hankering for Crispy Pata or Lechon Kawali.  They know us here.  They always speak to my husband in Tagalog and he answers right back in English. They always know our usual orders.
1,"Diamond AAA resort.  The lush greens made me wish I was a golfer.  Service was top notch all around the clock.  Spacious rooms, great room service.  You can park for free underground.nnThere are a handful of pools and a deceivingly fast water slide.  Poolside service is great and there are always waitstaff bringing you pitchers of water and ready to take your order.  Get the kobe burger with fries!  There was no steak salad on the poolside menu so I have no idea what the previous reviewers were raving about.  There are also a ton of koi fish in the pond leading to the canyon villas.  If you ask the pool staff, they might let you feed them with what looks like miniature dog food pellets.  Prepare yourself for attack of the monster koi!   nnThere is a super cute ice cream parlor and even a flower shop on the premises.  Loved the hooded bathrobes and generous amenities  nnIxnay on the followingnPaid internet and gym usage.  nNo infinity pool or lazy rivernLobster bisque with no lobster to be found room servicennSee my separate reviews on JG Steakhouse and the Centre for Wellbeing."
1,"Beautiful resort villas snuggled in the midst of beautiful Scottsdale. This property has a golf course nestled next and has multiple pools.  The rooms are deluxe king studio side and premium king  bedroom We were placed in the deluxe side, which was clean and well maintained.  The main difference I saw was the kitchen. It was like that of an apartment, with a mini fridge, no fireplace and  a smaller unit.  We did go into a Premium unit, it was lovely, very spacious, seating for , full kitchen, separate bedroom with large bathroom and a fireplace. nnWe fell in love with Corey, our concierge, who was so accommodating and friendly.  Scott, the manager, seems to be doing a great job and acknowledged our stay  Star owner by sending us a welcome amenity, very kind.  We were impressed with the cleanliness of the property and the staff, most have been there since the property opened. that speaks volumes nnWill make this a yearly event in our calendar."
1,Amazing food I had the peppersteak pasty  friendly knowledgeable staff! Our office orders from here regularly and picks it up and we have been in here a few times as well! I have also been to their other location and it is just as great! Great Job guys!
1,"Its freaking snowing in there! Seriously, instead of just confetti falling from the ceiling, this place has snow flakes that fall on the dance floor. It was quite the surprise the first time it happened, and also rather refreshing.nnId never been to Jet so I cant make the same comparison as some of these yelpers. However, I disagree with the low ratings, I loved this place. The setup was cool with the bars on the outside, then the tables, with the dance floor smack in the middle. The dance scene was legit. Plus when I heard Kanye had DJed there when it opened on NYE, I was completely sold.nnGuys, be smart. First, get at least a  ratio with girls before you try to go in. Also, if youre really smart, youll stop by there with a couple of them during the afternoon and you can get line skipping passes and half off admission tickets."
1,"Take all of your friends! I took a group of friends here and despite their lack of culinary adventure, they loved it and so did I. The tapas were excellent and flavorful. The seafood was tasty and pleaccording to my nonveg friends.nnThe meat looked delicious and everyone fought for the last piece. nnFunky, eclectic And supports local artists. Chef Owner greeted us, not sure if he usually does that but he was really cool.nnAlso, don t be discouraged by its off strip location, it was worth ditching the bland buffets and pulling our car out of hotel lot for a short drive, its right off the freeway. nnGreat place!"
1,"OMG. First thanks to Yelp for helping us find this place. nnIt is a small place but outstanding. When ordering, order half rolls if you want room to try more. Like everyone else has said  very fresh, very good, well priced. They have high chairs FYI. We had A service. Asked our server for suggestions and she was right on. Will definitely be back.  They are open until  AM."
1,"Its Spring!  And nothing says Spring in Vegas like al fresco dining!  nnEmbers has a terrific, cozy outdoor patio with a trickling fountain next to which you can enjoy their terrific cocktails and small plates. I highly recommend their Moscow Mule for all of you vodka aficionados out there  Vodka, lime and Fever Tree Ginger Beer which made for bright, tart flavors  perfect libation for warmer weather!   nnWe eschew red meat  and Embers has a nice set of appetizers for the less carnivorous.  Deep fried artichoke hearts were really well done crispy on the exterior while remaining soft and luscious on the inside.  Their Ahi tuna on minirice cakes with masago and micro greens is very well done as well!  We sampled their Caprese Salad which was nice  but easily, for me anyway, one of my favorite dishes we tried was the Seared Diver Scallop with Roasted Cauliflower, Cauliflower Puree and Wilted Frisee.  The scallop was perfectly seared on the outside and wonderfully nearlyrare.  The roasted cauliflower added additional textural interest and was a creative touch. nnService was very swift and attentive throughout, even with the restaurant packed with people. Music choices were amusing and surprising to us old rock and rollers  we heard No Fun by the Stooges, Sweet Jane by the Velvets and ShaLaLaLaLee by The Small Faces while we were there!nnDefinitely a new spot for us that is close to home.  Glad to have met ya Embers!"
1,I have been going to this club for years when it was previously known as RA.  I dont have too much to say about this club.  All the times I have been here I have had a good time.  Most of the reviews comment on the long lines or cluster F of people in front of the club.  Maybe I have just been fortunate enough to not have waited in those lines as I have only gone bottle service at LAX.nnNow about the bottle service....we had a table right on the dance floor and I had to say the bottle service is as good as it gets.  I think it was something like one waitress to one or two tables and I never poured a drink the whole night.  I thought this club deserved  stars because of the excellent bottle service.
1,I LOVE Yard House! It is definitely one of my favorite restaurants. They have a big selection of food and draft beers. Ive never had a meal that wasnt delicious! I took away a star only because the service at this location can be a major hit or miss.
1,"This ended up being my favorite restaurant on this trip. Funny because we just chose it on a whim since wed just flown in. As we enjoyed superior service and amazing fish, like the hot mess, we were wasting our experience looking on our phones for our last night fancy dinner. See review for mix. I wish we would have just returned here!"
1,This little gem is a new favorite of ours. We are new to the neighborhood and we love stopping in here for lunch or to grab something quick that we forgot to buy at the grocery store. The staff are always friendly and greet you promptly when you walk in. They even know most customers by name. The sandwiches are a great value and you never have to wait long for them to be made. Great business we have been and will continue to be repeat customers.
1,"The Guilford Arms is a great pub, the decor is great and has a very Victorian feel to it. The range of real ales that Guilford offers is very impressive and throughout the year they have a special ale that is offered. The prices are quite expensive but if you are into your real ales, there arent many places around that would be able to compete with the Guilford Arms for choice. However, as Im not that into my real ales the choice of drink was not much better than you would get in most pubs, but at a slightly higher than average price.nDue to its central location. it can become quite busy in the evenings when the office workers finish and make use of the restaurant service. This added to the fact that it is located right next to a backpackers hostel means that there is a varied crowd, which actually adds to the atmosphere."
1,"I went to Madison for the first time this weekend, and of course the boy brought me to Ians to try the mac and cheese pizza. I admit, I was skeptical  I mean, macaroni and cheese on a pizza??? But it was my favorite food of the weekend and there were a lot of great foods!. No tomato sauce, just lots of cheese we think ricotta on the bottom, then the mac and cheese, and melted cheddar on the top and deliciousness. I heard theyre opening an Ians in Chicago, and when they do, I will be first in line for mac and cheese pizza on their opening day!"
1,"Ne paye pas de mine mais tout dans la qualitue! Service super sympathique. Une des meilleures poutines que j ai manguees!! Le tofu burger est excellent les les sandwichs comme le blt sont de bonne taille et bien garni. Des frites fraiches, rien ne sent le surgelue ici! J ai adorue! On est passue plein de fois devant sans s arreter? Quelle erreur!! Et en plus les prix sont plus que raisonnable. Je recommande mille fois!!"
1,"My number  all time favorite restaurant! If you want the best dining experience, request patio seating and enjoy the bellagio watershow.  Make reservations in advanced, or you may not be able to get in without a very long wait during the weekends! Enjoy!"
1,"The sandwiches are creative, fresh and tasty ... sometimes a bit juicy for elegant eating, but hey, most of the time the place is full of students, and students dont take time for elegance, no?  The free cookie is nice, the no refills soda policy is not.  Prices are fair.  nBut the place is LOUD.  Uncomfortably so.  Its not the music, or even the conversation level ... its that there is not one soft surface in the place, and sound amplifies as it bounces off glossy walls, counters, tables and floors.  Its designed that way, and lord knows why. nThe sandwiches and salads make up for it, though."
1,"Im a fan! Weve ordered a full pizza and have also gotten their special  for two cheese slices.  They charge . for each topping added to your cheese slices but their slices are HUGE.  We are talking big slices that you have to fold in half to eat!nnWhat I actually love about their pizza is the crust...I am not a fan of any crust but their thin crust was perfect! The edges were also nice and crispy.nThey also have other things on their menu like lasagna and pasta and wings but we havent gotten that far yet...nnThey are packed on the weekends so expect a bit of a wait and they are closed on Mondays, but other than that, their pizzas are great for our hood!nnOh and its CASH only..."
1,"In an age when tailoring is becoming a lost art, this is the place to go to have your clothes tailored rather than merely altered.  Pasquale is an artist, offering bespoke suits, shirts and jackets, as well complete tailoring of off the rack items.  His knowledge of constructing a suit from scratch allows him to alter a suits chest, waist, jacket length, shoulders, lapel, etc.  services I have not found elsewhere.  He has an artists eye and will tailor your clothes to fit your entire body, not just sleeve and pant length.  Pasquale does the fitting and tailoring himself, so you are assured of quality throughout the process.nnThe emphasis is on quality craftsmanship, so some patience helps, though Pasquale often helps those who have an emergency and need something done in short order.  The atmosphere of the shop is casual and friendly.  The prices are a bit more than some other shops, but considering the quality of the work and the hours of craftsmanship involved, they are really dirt cheap.nnIf you have never had a suit or other item expertly tailored, I highly recommend bringing something to Pasquale.  The difference to standard alterations is akin to that between a Ford and Ferrari.  Pasquale has tailored all my suits, etc., even those I had previously had altered elsewhere.  If I sound like Im proselytizing, its because Im a convert."
1,"My husband had an emergency wisdom tooth extraction. I was searching on yelp and online to find the perfect oral surgeon and came across Dr. Saxe because my kids go to his brothers office for cleaning. The receptionist was very nice when I called at am to see if she could squeeze us in. She was able to get us in the same day and gave me the choices my husband can choose from getting local anesthesia to getting put out.nnWhen I came in the office it well organized and clean. We got called back quickly and the assistant asked a few questions and made my husband and I watch a video about what to expect. Although the patient rooms seemed a little old school, the doctor and staff were friendly."
1,"I really liked staying here, the price was reasonable and it was near all of the shows I was going to.  nnI was a little peeved that our room was not ready when we got there but they fixed it and it turned out fine.  nnPlus when you in Vegas, who spends time in the room anyways!nnAnd their cocktail servers were good in the casino."
1,"Scottsdale Smile Center is fantastic!  The staff is very friendly, professional, and accommodating.  There is nothing that could be done better here  top notch!  I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a great dental practice."
1,Im a bit surprised I gave Big Wong only three stars before. Although not five stars thats reserved for stellar experiences. Big Wong is a HARD four stars. As four as you can get without being a five. The food reminds me of the steamy rice and noodle shops on Mott St. back in NYC. They are straight up delicious and priced to be ordered in abundance. I wish Big Wong was closer to my house. Like next door would be perfect.
1,Great atmosphere and decor..a welcome change from the chains and anchor restaurants in the area that all feel the same. My wife could not stop raving about the EVO salad so safe to recommend that along with my Caesar. Only slight complaint is how fast our food came... Wouldve have liked things slowed down a bit more since the place is so inviting. We will be back.
1,"Ah, Vegas.  Its hard to find a good meal that isnt thousands of dollars.  Sushi Roku was probably our best meal on my latest trip.  The sushi selection is relatively small compared to other cities, but I guess youd expect that in the middle of a desert?  I dont know...  But I went with the japanese short ribs appetizer for my meal because we didnt expect to eat a full meal.  It was so good I asked for a side of rice to soak up every bit of the juicesauce that it was with.  The rolls my dining parter had were good, too.nnThe service was OK  not incredibly attentive but not bad either.  I imagine on a busy night there were only a few people at the time it could get slow."
1,"Its a nice little place to get some brew. The tour was basic and informative given by a volunteer local beer brewing enthusiast. The brewery is a fun thing to do and a great place to take a visitor to enjoy some beer. The sad part was that there was no free sample after the tour which was kind of a let down. nnThe tap room is nice. High ceiling, im guessing those were German flags in the rafters, a nice long corner bar and plenty of servers.  nThey only had  beers on tap at the moment a third being tapped soon i did enjoy the Copper more than the other choice. nn. for a pint."
1,Living in Las Vegas I decided to check this place out back in . The store was a typical pawn shop with the cast actually being on property doing their jobs. Fast forward to last week and alot has changed as the shows popularity has grown. nnThe line to get in was down and around the corner but being a local I showed my I.D. to the guy at the front and walked right in. The store was crowded but not to the point I wanted to leave or felt packed in like a sardine. The merchandise area is what it is. I mean hey if I could make a buck selling a tshirt w my face I would do it too. The items in the cases are actually for sale which is a good thing. The young woman that helped me said she could drop the price of a watch I liked by  but it was still way over priced. nnThe guys on the show were back in their offices and did not come out. The old man wasnt in and I did feel a bit of disappointment since the last time I was there he walked the floor and almost sold me on a motorcycle in the back. nnIm giving this review  stars because it is what it is. A pawn shop made famous for our love of reality TV and by the hard sale pitch of Rick way back when. Its a great spot to visit a great spot to say you have visited and a great spot to kill a little time. If your not buying they keep you moving I guess to accommodate the line of souvenir shoppers. After all I did buy that Tshirt when all was said and done so it worked on me too
1,"One of the BEST restaurants in PHOENIX!  the burgers there are home made and are the most tasty burgers I have ever had.. not to mention their Baclava dont know how to spell, but HELL of good!!! GREAT lunch specials which include a beer as your drink!  need I say more!  Please make time to go in and have a burger here you will not be disapointed!"
1,"Ive come to Golfsmith a few times and always walked away pleased with my experience. Its not the ginormous golfamusementpark retail experience that you get when you go to the PGA Tour Superstore, but it gets the job done.nnThey have a good selection of new clubs, and Ive found their pricing on used clubs to be extremely competitive, if not better than the PGA Store. They also have really good sale pricing on their clothing pretty much all the time. In addition, the service has always been up to par as well.nnId recommend Golfsmith if youre in the area and want to avoid the larger store a few exits South on the freeway."
1,"Was at grand reopening of Herberger, featuring miniperformances from performing arts organizations including Phoenix Boys Choir, Phoenix Opera, AZ Opera, Scottsdale School of Ballet, Epik Dance, Valley Youth Theatre.nnKudos on the renovation  new entrances grants accessibility from nd Street, while maintaining rd Street and Monroe accessibility.nnIn general, the Herberger is welldesigned as an overall theatre destination. Both main stages, Central Stage and Stage West, maintain an intimate feel  every seat in the house is worth having.  The bar counter opens to ample outdoor patio seating, which overlooks the central courtyard. nnBeautiful ndfloor openair loft space above the central rotunda and cozy lounge in the west wing with balcony overlooking the central courtyard. Both spaces were used to showcase local artists this weekend, the lounge seems esp. perfect for event space."
1,It has been about  years since I last visited and it took me this long and a few people to say good things about them before I could return. My last visit was reminiscent of cheaply made sushi and bland food. The green tea fried ice cream was terrible.nnJust last Sunday I had a wonderful experience and the place was nearly packed to full capacity. The happy hour had a few great items and they also have specials that are written on the boards. The atmosphere was cozy and relaxing. nDont miss the surf sushi or the lollipop. Ill be returning next week to enjoy other interesting sounding items like pork and ahi sliders.
1,"I love this store. Its always a quite place to find great cards! I love the quite time I get here reading all the funny cards  The staff is great too, because they never judge me when I am there reading cards for  mins. ! nnThe stores have a way better selection than anywhere else and they also have great one of a kind gifts too. Also during the holidays, nothing beats a Keepsake ornament. I can fill a whole Christmas tree with all the Keepsakes I have! nnMy mom would always buy, send and give Hallmark cards and that has just been something that has stuck with me. I know that nowadays you can find Hallmark cards almost anywhere, but its not the same as when you actually go to a real Hallmark store. If you havent been into a Hallmark in awhile or at all its something to checkout."
1,"Ive been wanting to check this place out for awhile now, and I decided to for lunch today. As soon as I walked it, I felt comfortable since it has that great, Irish pub feel, but more refined. I tried out the tasty Hasher Burger, and it was unbelievable. I cant even describe it, other than a classic burger taste. The sweet potato fries were crispy with some rosemary and sea salt. My boyfriend had fish and chips, and the portions were huge. Big hunks of cod fried to perfection. A great place that Ill be revisiting soon."
1,"If you are looking for a great spot to eat this is it! There menu is creative,organic, and overall amazing. Jeff the owner takes pride in delivering quality as well as culinary twists to every plate. There coffee is amazing they always carry different specialty coffee to also add quality in not only food but there drinks. If you want fresh prepared food and amazing coffee crepe bar is the place to go."
1,"This is only for the pedicures.nnI have only gone to one other place to get a pedi, it was absolutely atrocious and I never went anywhere after that! This place is super close to my house and one day I decided to pamper my tootsies.nnUpon entering you are greeted and asked to sign in. After you go look at the nail polishes they offer, including OPI and others, choose your color, and go sit in the warm water and luxurious massaging chair!!nnThe previous  times I went the man did my pedis, hes great and actually talks!! I expected a quick pedi, but here a pedi takes about an hour. I was in heaven! He clipped my little nails, squared at the top bc rounded look gross, and filed my feets.nnThe big difference here is the quality of the pedi. He really took his time and assured I was comfy and that was before the massage on my legs!!nnAfter he was done painting my toes, he took a brush and made sure there was no remaining polish, I was seriously impressed!!nnPedis are  and a combo of mani pedi is .nnI will def continue to come here!!nnYay!"
1,"I am in love with this hotel. The first thing I noticed was the intricate architecture and decor. Whoever designed this hotel did a great job in recreating a Parisian atmosphere. I loved the color scheme in my room so much that I am adopting it for my new apartment when I move later this year! I stayed for two nights last week while attending WWD Magic. The staff were very helpful and accommodating. I got room service for lunch and dessert the first night I was there and was pretty impressed with the quality of the food. And, I loved, loved, LOVED the Sugar Factory. Even if you dont stay in the hotel, you must make a stop there while youre walking down the strip. The casino area isnt as big as some of the other hotels Ive visited e.g. MGM Grand, Bellagio, Caesars...but I dont think anybodys is as big as they are!. Chateau is a pretty nice nightclub, I really liked the outdoor area the beer garden. If it wasnt so hot when I was there, I wouldve hung out there a lot longer! The thing I appreciated the most was the price. Considering that its across the street from The Cosmopolitan and The Bellagio, youd think it would be expensive. Thats totally not the case! I was able to stay in the red room suite, and it was just barely over  per night after taxes and such. Thanks for a great time Paris, Ill definitely be back! You make a nice substitute for the real thing!"
1,"We stopped off for lunch and had the California Burger and my wife had the build your own burger. The waitress came over to our table and didnt introduce herself, just asked us what we wanted to drink. That out of the way, I noticed that all their hamburgers are  lb. Pretty good size. When we got our order, it was served on an oval plate with lots of sweet potato fries....YUM!! The bun was fresh and the hamburger cooked just right. My wife could only finish half and when I was done, I was stuffed. I probably could have gone without dinner that night. For two burgers and two lemonades, our bill came to .. Not  a place you drop by that often...but when you do, its well worth it."
1,"Just flew in from San Diego and the first text I get when we land is, I hope you guys are hungry! All my cousin can talk about is this amazing mexican place we have to try. He seemed to be over selling the place for about two hours. After we finally get our appetites we head over. We start with chips and salsa and its good.  Spicy and delicious. Then the molcajetes come out and damn. Theres beef chicken and shrimp in this amazing sauce in this boiling stone bowl. With sides of beans rice and guacamole and fresh tortillas. Two big bowls was enough for all four of us. If you have not been here you need to go. The service was good and the food was super tasty. I could not keep from pigging out. They really need to expand to san diego."
1,"httpwww.vimeo.comnnvideo my buddy made...nId just like to thank all the volunteers who made it happen.  Without everyone out their braving the windy conditions, none of could have made it...so much kudos to you all!  And the city of Tempe for hosting such a great event to make so many dreams come true."
1,OMFG.. I tried their burger for the first time few weeks ago when my boyfriend took me for lunch. He ordered for me since I had no clue as to how to order. I took one bite of the burger and it just melted in my mouth! My boyfriend also ordered the Cajun fries and I was kind of hesitant at first because I thought the Cajun seasoning was going to burn my mouth. Well it didnt. I had a few and it started to get spicy for me so I started dipping it in ketchup and it toned the spiciness down. Yummy!!!
1,I showed up at this airport late on a Friday night after lots of travel delays and cancellations so I was not in the greatest mood. But every single person that worked at the airport that I interacted with was incredibly kind and thoughtful. They were so wonderful that it made me want to move to NC. Charlotte airport is incredibly lucky to have such amazing employees.
1,Got together with some good friends for dinner here. Great cocktails and wine selection and good food. We had a great time and the staff was gracious enough to let us take our time catching up with each other.
1,"The restaurant in Concord, NC is great.  Our waiter Jared was super great, one of the best waiters we have had at a chain restaurant.  Food was good and plentiful, so splitting an entree which we did on  fed a family of  and kept cost down."
1,"Give me pistachios or give me death. Pistachio ice cream, cookies, desserts, or straight up, I love those damn little things. So when I walked in to find pistachio ice cream, I didnt take long to make a choice. nnOf course, there are tons of other flavors as well. I also tried the animal cookie and after just one bite, my teeth were wearing sweaters. I couldnt handle the sugar inside that one, even though I am the queen of sucrose. So, I went with pistachio. nnIt was delicious! I am not one for cones, especially when going to be driving so I got it in a cup. The scoop is cute, but makes for kind of difficult eating. Id like to get some in its own little dish to snack on at home. nnFour stars only because the lighting is abrasive and the floor plan is kinda awkward. But its tasty and thrifty!"
1,"Chronic tacos is my favorite place to have lunch at work. It helps that its Mexican food which is my all time favorite food. My favorite thing to get it the handheld burrito. Its not as big as there normal burrito but its perfect for lunch. When you order after pm you het free chip and salsa which are amazing as well. I really like their steak, seasoned pretty well. Not a huge fan of the chicken, but I like to change it up once in a while. nnAnother thing I like is they have the limes on the line for tacos and burritos. Also the staff is really nice. They put on extra cheese or salsa for me if I ask. Plus they always chat me up when they can. Cool place to go."
1,"Best croissants this side of the Atlantic. Layers upon layers of buttery goodness on the inside and crispy on the outside. nnWe usually get the bread basket to start. You get to pick an assortment of breadpastries. Alls good. nnI love their croque madame. The bread has a good crust on outside and soft inside. Tasty ham and cheese and topped off with an egg. nnWeve also tried their specials on previous trips...the pork belly, the trout. Great flavor and texture. Theyre accompanied by delicious vegetables. nnMy other favorite is their mint ice cream. You can really taste the fresh mint. And no, its not green colored ice cream. nnIm happy theres a Bouchon now in LA. I dont have to drive out to Vegas when I crave their food."
1,"I have been to several Indian buffets in Phoenix and also in San Francisco and Boston and I was definitely pleased with my experience here. I got the Groupon for two buffets for  and came in on a Saturday night to find an almost empty restaurant. Nevertheless, the food was hot and fresh and there was a nice variety of options for vegetarians and meat eaters alike, and most of the dishes were very tasty. nnThe atmosphere is kind of weird particularly some of the employees who watch over you awkwardly and peer out the door hoping the place is going to fill up miraculously. Otherwise would definitely recommend. nnP.S. The Naan was delicious. My girlfriend couldnt get enough,"
1,Since my original review of the Scottadale Mortons I have been in touch with both corporate Mortons and the local restaurant. Mortons were very responsive and promises to make it right. Very classy and appreciated by me. Ill definitely be back and cant wait to have another dinner there.
1,"I purchased their annual membership through groupon when it was available. Came with  free passes for  individuals as well as  extra passes for any guests you wanted to take in with you. Overall great deal! Anyway this place is a great for killing time or for touring any visitors you may have who want to see something different than the strip. They have a wide selection of displays about the landscape, wild life, environment of desert we have here in Nevada. There are also seasonal displays that are forever changing so be sure to sign up for their email notification to catch up on whats new. One moment it could be CSI Bugs, then Inventions of Davinci exhibit. Their Cafue is delicious! Prices are reasonable and their menu is seasonal as well with new options being presented every month. The outdoor exhibit is always evolving and expanding so it may not look like much but they are constantly expanding their botanical gardens and trails. I was a bit disappointed because the grounds looked more of a construction site than an actual trails, but its getting there so I cant really give a positive review on the outdoor aspect of Springs Preserve. What makes this place amazing though is that Springs Preserve plays host to many social events! In the Summer they have all you can eat icescream festivals. Cultural festivals. Beer and Wine Tasting Parties and more! Although Springs Preserve is a bit on the small side there are always new events and exhibits going on which will make you want to buy the membership pass so you can receive half off admission to any event being hosted. Overall the exhibits were great and very informative, but I would have liked to see more of them. Great place to take your kids."
1,"First time here. Restaurant reincarnation from a former family restaurant at the Four Seasons Troon. nOrdered  beer samplers which unfortunately came well after our appetizer pretzel knots were consumed  I assume the wait staff were overwhelmed by the Saturday crowd but replacement knots were brought for us as appeasement.nThe meals lobster roll, hamburger, salmon were excellent. Remember this is not a cheap place to eat so expect to drop some coin. nThe waiter, named Tony felt so bad about the delay in our drinks, he provided us milkshakes which truly exemplified the  milkshakes talked about in Pulp Fiction  they were delicious. He also packed us up to go with hot chocolate chip cookies  fantastic, I will be back."
1,Nice customer service with a clean environment..I like that the store crew try to make the best of it with lines to the door..I go almost every day and the bosses always have a smile on their faces make you want to come back..Also like how the bosses are always trying to keep the line moving..only bad thing i have to say to small the building ..
1,"This Albertsons is close to our house, so we started going here for the convenience. This store quickly became a favorite. Every employee goes out of their way to be helpful, and are extremely friendly. nThe produce department is well stocked, and has a great selection. They recently updated their display case in the fresh meat and seafood case. it looks great. The king crab legs are quite impressive, and their meat quality is top notch. n They always have great sales as well, throughout the store. Cannot beat their meat sale prices."
1,"In my previous review, I recommended SaintHenri MicroTorruefacteur in spite of the inconsistent coffee preparation I experienced regularly someday the coffee would taste amazing, another day it would be a diluted mess. Well, it seems like the coffee angels heard me! Over the past  weeks, the several Latte I ordered have all been consistently well brewed, honoring their delicious coffee beans. I raise my two thumbs to the coffee shop and its baristas who have made my life even more enjoyable! I pray that this trend continues, Amen."
1,"Theres something abut this location that I love.  The food is always tastier.  The portions are always larger.  The staff are always friendlier.  The architecture is more unique than other locations.    nnMaybe its more appealing because I typically stop by this Chipotle after hitting the gym, when Im absolutely famished.  Yet again, maybe the foods just made with more love.  Not that Ive ever had a bad meal at Chipotle...  Ill gladly drive a little out of the way to dine at this location.nnRight now Im hooked on the chicken salad.  Im very picky about my toppings and  theyre always very accommodating.  Side of brown rice?  Check.  Separate containers of two salsas?  No problem.  A teensy bit of cheese?  You got it!  True Chipotle consistency, with a little bit more pizzazz."
1,"If you want to get extremely drunk and have major brain freeze, this is the place to go!nnI dont even remember what I got the alcohol probably killed a few brain cells, but it was strong and delicious! nnBetween the  of us, we finished a pretty big drink in  minutes or so. Its Vegas, the whole point is to get drunk the fastest."
1,"I stumbled into Mr. Tofu on a whim, and was not disappointed. True that you might wait a bit for even the side dishes, but they were all tasty so I didnt mind. I ordered the grandmalike chicken noddle soup. I say this because it tasted very homemade with a few sprinkles of love. My other half ordered the seafood tofu soup, and was very pleased. If you really like the strong taste of seafood, then you would love the seafood tofu soup. I could taste the shrimp heads. All in all, this is a good restaurant, but I wouldnt suggest going here if you are on the verge of starvation for youd probably die by the time the side dishes came. Nice service though."
1,"Buy one get one beers, yes! I had the meatloaf sandwich with fries, loved both. Place isnt the classiest place around, but I really enjoyed my food. Place looks like a chain, something I hate, but there is only one of these around. It has that cheesy chain feel because its in the cheesiest casino on the strip, Circus Circus.  Normally I would never go to a place like this, but the circumstances brought me to this end of the strip and my sandwich was just what I needed."
1,"My mouth is watering thinking about this place I shouldnt write reviews when Im hungry.  different sorts of meat, unlimited salad bar, yummy warm cheesy bread, and authentic Brazilian caipirinha  yum. nnI came here for date night and had a great time. Our server was really friendly and explained how the the steakhouse worked as far as meats and the salad bar. Each of the meat servers is actually a gaucho chef. I think our server said there were  of them. That means each of the gentlemen bringing you meat and carving it for you is actually the person preparing it as well. That was impressive and nice to know. nnAs far as the food, some of the meats were hit or miss for me.  The sausage was just meh, the bottom sirloin was a bit salty, but the picanha, alcatra, and parmesan crusted pork loin were so delicious.  Most of the meats were juicy but had a perfect fire roasted char on the outside. YUM.nnI know they have several areas they can convert to private rooms for functions or larger groups.  I talked to the service manager and he let me know theres no fee to rent a room and they can even split everyones check individually in a party.  Im definitely thinking about doing my graduation party here with my family and friends!"
1,YUMMY! Went in to try with the groupon they offered. Very good food  very reasonably priced! Loved the Frontier burger. Friedn pickles were to die for  Oreo shake was delicious! Well definitely be back!
1,"Ive taken my kids there for lab work and the clinic personnel are always very nice and professional.  It is not as busy as the bigger clinics, so I prefer to go there instead of where our docs are when we need labs done between visits."
1,"Awesome! Went with my love and we had a blast. Great food and reasonable hookah prices. Plenty of favors. The ambiance is beautiful and intimate. A nice change of pace place in Vegas to relax and do something different. Really nice staff, clean, and classy. Will be back when I come back to Vegas."
1,"Been coming to saigon nites for several years and we have no complaints.  The owners are very courteous to their regulars and the food is great.  I may not know authentic vietnamese cuisine but their food tastes good to me and thats all that matters.  Their thai ice tea is super delicious. It is so good with a hot bowl of steak pho  nnAs long as Saigon nites stays in business, we will be coming back."
1,"While visiting Squirrel Hill, I had a serious need for coffee and my friends directed me straight to The Coffee Tree Roasters. I had an iced coffee with caramel and it was amazing  not too sweet, strong enough and they have the front window removed for easy access to the summer breeze and peoplewatching on Forbes. Very nice."
1,"After going too the same doctor in Oregon for  years i found Dr Mohans office  when I moved to AZ.   I have nothing but good to say about my experiences.  Ive unfortunately had a series of health issues.  So Im a frequent visitor.  Doctor Mohan, the PA and NP are always very thorough and now have a cardiologist once a month.  Ive had sudden problems and always Been able to get  in immediately.  Dr Mohan discusses her patients visits with the  PA and NP and Ive often gotten phone calls to return for immediate follow up after her review.  My elderly mother was visiting from Oregon and had a nasty fall.  She went to the ER then I brought her for follow up.  She didnt bring any of her Medicare or insurance info. Dr Mohan treated her and said we will figure out the insurance later.  And they still ask how she is every time I visit   Im happy with the practice.  If people are happy they generally dont post.  And Carefree is not known for its youthful population.  So most probably dont yelp"
1,Used call ahead seating on a Friday night and glad we did because the placed was busy. Thats always a good sign.nThe food was excellent and we took advantage of the drink specials.nWe sat on the patio which was nice.nWe would go again.
1,"Here is a prime example of why men should truly listen to their wives. Haha. We watched the food network a few months back and had been left drooling over these, but were not aware that this was nestled within F.A.M.E. however eating at Fukuburger adjacent to this changed everything in a snap!nnThe  for  puff deal is a steal if you ask me and certainly the wallet thought so as well! nnThe puffs themselves were deceptive as at first you give it the its not so big stare and then biting into it you realize oh man how am I going to finish this whole thing dont judge haha. It was cooked to perfection as it was far from too crispy or soggy and it just pulled apart with ease and melted away like butter! What did tickle my fancy was the filling. I have certainly had my share of custard being a Midwestern boy and this one was money. It was served slightly chilled and was not overly or underly WOW, take that Merriam Webster sweet, but was one of the better custards I have consumed to date.nnAll in all I have now found that go to dessert when I am in need of a sweet fix on the strip and Ill be sure next time to break out the stretch pants!"
1,"Great Starbucks whether you go through the drive thru or inside. I stop by every morning drive thru. Service is quick and the employees are all really nice. My order has always been correct.nnThe inside is spacious and there is a nice sized patio. Its always been real clean anytime I have been inside and even if there are a lot of people, it never feels very crowded."
1,"First time having fish and chips in years, gotta say brought back great memories. nnHaddock with chips for just over  which was a great deal! n The fish was perfectly fried and didnt leave a greasy aftertaste.n The chips were just crispy on the outside and very light and fluffy on the inside.nnThe bonus of the loyalty card is awesome, only negative with it is the expiry date that is on the card given that I do not go to waterloo often enough to hit the  stamps needed.nnOverall, the rating would be a ., I loved the flash back to my fried fish eating days. The environment is very relaxed with the feel of a laid back urban loft. I would have given a , but the expiry date of the loyalty card drops . stars."
1,"Went on Friday night and it was packed but still all of my girls had a blast. Dance floor is small so if you can  try to get a table. Loved the girls in the tub and on stage! If your a girl, walk by the club during the day to see if you can get in for free for the night. They should be giving out  waistbands or put you on the list. nnI highly recommoend on getting a table. Service and wait would be a lot faster. Over all, we had a great time."
1,The best  bucks I have spent on an hour massage. Everything of importance was worked on. My favorite part was the head massage and the hand massage. I was so relaxed I even fell asleep! I will never go to a traditional massage place again. Happy feet I am now a forever customer.
1,"Chicken and donuts  two of Americas favorite things. Add those to the team behind Welcome Diner and youve got an awesome new place!nnVisited on a Saturday a little before AM. There was a line but we didnt wait too long. My boyfriend and I both got the twopiece combo. I chose the Japanese BBQ and the chocolate donut and he went Korean with a maple bacon donut. nnOkay. I know what youre thinking  isnt this a fried chicken place? Whats with the Asian sauces? Asian chicken with donuts? Whats going on?? Yes, its a weird combo. But trust me, somehow it works and its freaking fantastic so just go with it.nnThe Japanese BBQ was out of this world. So delicious. It was tangy and flavorful, definitely more of a Japanese flair than BBQ. The Korean sauce was good but a little too spicy for me. So if youre a fan of mild, go Japanese. The pieces are smaller than what you get at a KFC or another place like that. It actually reminded me that chickens arent supposed to be that big so I was okay with the smaller pieces.nnI got the miso corn as my side. It was good but a few too many peppers for my taste. If it was just the corn Id have gobbled it up.nnOkay, on to the donuts. I hate to say it but they were just okay. I really wanted to like them and after the amazing chicken expected big things. I didnt like the maple bacon donut at all weird, right?! The bacon part was good but the donut was a little too chewy and left an odd aftertaste. The chocolate cake donut was better but was a little grainy. I have to say that my boyfriend went back the next week and got the regular donut and said it was very good. So save the upgrade and go regular donut I guess!nnSo despite the soso donut Im still giving this place  stars just for the chicken. As we were driving away I already wanted more. Needless to say, I will be back!"
1,"Been to this buffet numerous times and I think its the best in Vegas.  Last time I went , I was slightly disappointed with the rest of the seafood choices other than the crab legs.  Not much variety, but still damn good.  Im going to skip to the desserts because they and they alone should be enough for one to come to this buffet.  Dont eat so much savory that you wont have room for the sweet.  Trust me on this.  Creme brulee...off the chain.  Chocolate souffle...make you wanna cry.  Cream puffs...I can probably eat  of them...after eating  crab legs...and still want to play craps afterwards...with a big ass smile.  See you again, Studio B.  Im a fan and always will be."
1,"Beautiful decor with metal structure of the tower throughout the dining area.  Elevator to the restaurant has you walk past the kitchen to the upstairs host stand.  I have eaten here twice now, once for dinner many years ago and this time for lunch.  Both times the price is obviously steap but for the ambiance, atmosphere, food quality and service provided it is definitely worth every penny!  Would definitely recommend as a place to dine and overlook the Bellagio fountains!"
1,"Ive bumped up a star because their curry is delightful and has only gotten better. nnOnly downside  nnThey still offer delivery, but the last few times Ive called, they dont want to deliver. I said I would wait and hour...even close to two. They still are very rude about it on the phone. I had a lady say  times that it would be a wait, and I said each time it was fine.  She then proceeded to sigh into the phone like she was pissed. I said, Can I really not do delivery? I cant come in...but, Im willing to wait.nnIf you dont want to deliver and you dont have time, say, We cannot deliver right now.nnGeeeeeeeeez."
1,"Recently under new ownership, and weve noticed a much better selection of wines that they offer. We love the happy hour!  and they offer TONS of fun wines to try by the glass. Our favorite the ONEHOPE Merlot  it was more like a bordeaux blend, and oh so good! Very affordable, and half of the profits get donated to charity. Well definitely be coming back to Enotria!"
1,"Date  I planned to eat at the restaurant, but found out it wouldnt be open for a week. We just happened upon an invite only preview taste and greet. The GM was gracious in allowing us to enter. The food is good, decor with back splashes of gold, hints of Asian decor. The food...was cooked in mass so its ok. Im sure it will be better for individual plates. Well try when its open and FAR less crowded. Oh, love the waitstaff, for tonight, well see."
1,This place is awesome!!! The theme is really unique and fun! Everything on the menu is unlike anything Ive had. I love how the kitchen is all clear glass and the recipes are all original! The rocky road is AMAZING!!  I ordered two!!
1,"Pretty funky hotel! Very happy to stay here for work as I was able to enjoy the big, cozy and chic room, plus the various amenities onsite during my off time.nnTheres a great spa, a cute barrestaurant and not just one, but two fantastic swimming pools!nnThere were minor noise issues in my room in the very middle of the night, but the folks at the front desk were extremely polite when I called in at am to let them know that there was considerable noise coming from the room above me. Even with earplugs I wear for travel I could hear what sounded like furniture being dragged across the floor. Though one has to expect some level of noise in hotels when traveling, I appreciated that my call was taken seriously and that they hopped into action to investigate asap.nnEverything from the linens to the soaps and the huge soaker tub made my stay absolutely awesome. The grounds were kept neat, the hallways were clean, and my room was spotless.nnHuge bonus points for A full length mirror, a bathrobe, a blowdryer, and free WIFI. When traveling these are things I look for first in a hotel and Valley Ho came through and knocked it out of the park. Of all of the hotels Ive stayed in on various trips to PHX, this is hands down the one Ill recommend to friends and keep at the top of my list."
1,"I didnt realize there was a Pita Jungle in Fashion Square... I was so happy when I saw it! The BF and I really just wanted a snack, so we to the garlic dip. The girl behind the counter was miserable and looked really mad that she was working. So not such good service, but the garlic dip, like usual, was delicious! I think they should probably give you at least  pitas with the dip.... but whatever. Also, the pita at this location didnt taste the same as what I remembered having at the sit down location."
1,"I discovered Atomic  becuase they hosted a fundraiser for a dog rescue group around St. Patricks Day and part of their procedes went to the cause. nnI love that the ingredients are all fresh, and you have so many options to choose from! You can taste the difference in the quality of ingredients!nnThe st time I went I had a pineapple upside down flavor, which tasted exactly like pineapple upside down cake!! My husband had chocolate ice cream with cookie dough pieces. I tried a spoon of his and the chocolate was amazing. It was really chocolatey! Unlike any chocolate you get at a grocery store!nnThe next time I went I had chocolate with fresh banana and my husband got bubble gum. Again, everything was fantastic!nnAnd, the rd time we went he had chocolate with cookie dough again and I got peanut butter w chocolate chips. The PB was SO goood!!!!nnPrices are comprable to Cold Stone, but the taste and selections FAR EXCEED anything that Cold Stone has.nnThe are located right by the Galleria in Henderson...and I drive all the way from Lone Mountain area to go here because it is THAT GOOD!!!nnLots of vegan, organic, and allergy friendly choices. They even keep the utensils separate for those with severe allergies! I dont have allergies, but it is still pretty cool that they do this!nnThey also have cakes, cupcakes, and puddings!nnStaff is always really friendly and helpful. I cannot wait for a location on the NW side!!!nnThey are also open til PM!!"
1,Cant say enough good things about Brittney! Ive had her walk and take care of my two high energy pitties over a long weekend. She came for a meet and greet and they instantly loved her. She was able to walk both even with their poor leash behavior. One was on medication which she gave with no problem. Also I add quite a few supplements to their food which she didnt bat an eye at. Kept me up to date with pics and texts without needing to ask. Came home to very happy and content pups! Definitely will use again and have recommended to a friend.
1,"Need a place to get your heart rate up, blood flowing or work off your dogs excess energy?  This is a great option.  Im here just about daily and usually TWICE per day with my puppies for a two mile or so walk around the perimeter and interior paths of this well manicured, well lighted at night park.nnIn my opinion, this is a much better option than a dog park even though it isnt an off leash area.  Also, if you drop by late at night with a blanket, this is a GREAT place to lay on your back and gaze at the stars without light pollution to interfere."
1,This place is a little off the beaten path of the main road but it was definitely a good find. The pricing wasnt too high and the staff is very friendly. Our waters were always full and several times someone came by to ask if we were okay.  My girlfriend got the vodka penne pasta which I tasted a couple times and it was delicious. Overall good atmosphere and service!
1,"We decided to go to this place when the other place we were going to hit was closed.  But boy were we happy we did!!!  This little Mom  Pop joint maybe grandparents is a better description has AMAZING food!!!  My friend and I were hungry and everything looked so good!  I had a chimichanga and a chili relleno and my friend had a combo with an enchilada, taco and a tostada.  Everything was soooooo good!  The relleno was AMAZING  so was everything else!  The rice and beans were also EXCELLENT!!!  The rice is not red, super yummy and flavorful.  I dont even usually eat beans at other places, but they were SO good here!!!  I just cant get over how good the food was!nnThe cute couple that run this place is super nice and inviting.  And they remember you.  A younger guy was there picking up a togo order and the mom told him she put in extra tortillas and salsa cuz his Dad always wants that, but it wasnt asked for in the order.  SO NICE!!!!  There is not a lot of room inside, and it was stuffy, so we went outside.  They told us they would tap on the window when our food was ready!    The only drawback was they dont serve alcohol, but when the food was that good, I didnt even miss it!  If you want a beer, take the food to go! Its totally worth it!!!  I wish I didnt live in CO will definately come back when I visit again!!!"
1,"The cod fish sandwich was excellent. It comes on two regular pieces of bread which we were initially concerned about, but it worked out perfectly. Tried and liked the hushpuppies. And the lemonade was really tasty. We are adding this one to our go to lunch place. Cant wait to try the other items on the menu!"
1,"Step  After attending an event with very little to eat, I saw someone with a pizza box from Grimaldis.  nnStep . While wondering, could this be related to the Grimaldis from NY I quickly launched the Yelp app on my iPhone and found the location for Grimaldis. nnStep . I admitted my thankfulness that the restaurant was still open thank you, Yelp, for telling me the hours.nnStep . Walked to the restaurant, which wasnt too far from the hotel I was staying at.n. nStep . Ordered a pizza.  This was probably the hardest part, due to the growing anticipation of deliciousness while waiting for a painful  minutes.  Gosh!nnStep . Paid about  for a large which isnt huge, but is decent pizza and walked back to the hotel.nnStep  Ate an amazing pizza by a gorgeous pool in Phoenix.  The cost and the wait were worth the price of admission.  Half pepperoni and half sausage.  Thin crust and brick oven baked.  YUM!nnStep  Wrote this review after returning home, and am salivating at the thought of a pizza that is , miles away.  Perhaps its worth a return trip to AZ"
1,"I love this place, I get my nails done here all the time, they always look good, and stay on for a really long time, but the issue that I have is they are not very careful with your nail beds, I always end up with hang nails and bleeding, I wish they where a little more gentle"
1,"Airport restaurants have never been my favorite. Always overpriced but what the heck. Looking for breakfast and saw breakfast burrito. This place is within the Terminal  A wing gate just past gate A. nnWasnt expecting much but the takeout line was short so I ordered the matcha and egg burrito. Very surprised. The tortilla was hot, thin, and down right good. Matcha was tender and juicy but just juicy enough so that its not dripping down your arm while eating it. The eggs were very good too. So I really loved my morning matcha breakfast burrito. nnYes a little overpriced but everything is overpriced at airports. Food good. Service fast. So if your looking for a quick and good breakfast burrito, I recommend this place. Enjoy and happy flying. I sure am."
1,"This was my first time here, I came here based on Yelp reviews. I expected a wowing experience because of the reviews but I didnt have that. I went in to take my acrylic nails off, get a gel manicure and a special pedicure. The guy who did my manicure was quiet at first but then he talked and was nice and he gave me a perfect manicure and at the end a very nice arm massage but it was too short. Then I went on to do my pedicure and it was an older lady that did it, I didnt know their names because they didnt have name tags. I had been faithful for over a year to another salon who gives me awesome special pedicures but they charge  and here you get the special pedicure for . Therefore you get what you pay for, the pedicure didnt make me feel relaxed,  it seemed like she was barely trying and was talking to the other Asian lady the whole time, she was distracted.  It kind of annoyed me they spoke in their language the whole time. Willing to go back when Im trying to save money but for quality Ill go back to my old salon."
1,"The COSMO is gorgeous, modern, full of great restaurants, bars, and clubs. Check in and service is very very inviting, friendly, and definitely  star. nnWe brought a crew of  very highclass meaning highmaintenance friends and business associates here for New Years last year. The place felt brand new, the rooms were sexy, complete with a japanese soaking tub, and we watched fireworks and the Bellagio fountains from our balcony. PERFECT view. nnBeautiful place, Id recommend anyone, from newbies visiting Vegas for the first time to Vegas lovers and even locals, stay here, dine here, gamble, party, etc... The Cosmo has the entire package."
1,"My goodness, I have missed you.  We headed to Madison for our st anniversary and since we booked the hotel I was trying to get my hands on a large cooler so I could stock up on my loved and very missed items at Trader Joes.  Thank you husbands coworker for the mighty fine cooler you provided!  nnThis is a particularly nice and well stocked Trader Joes!  The parking, as everyone claims, truly is a bit of a pain in the ass  oh well, parking at the one I frequented in Chicago was a bigger pain in the ass.   The staff here is just as nice as any other TJs, maybe a little nicer.  I was surprised by how well stocked everything was considering how busy it was and that it was a Sunday morning.   We walked out of here with  worth of deliciousness and we have now decided to purchase a deep freezer  well, weve been wanting to for quite some time, but this little trip and st time trip for my husband really helped seal the deal I think  and make a trip from good ol Wausau every other month or so.  nnMy god Ive missed this place."
1,"Yesterday I had my windshield replaced by Southwestern Auto Glass. Sewell responded timely to my calls, had everything set up within my insurance company very quickly, and came to my place of business to do the replacement. Their service was outstanding and they are extremely easy to work with. I highly recommend this company."
1,"I love Thai food and this spot hits the mark! Great food, excellent selection and awesome service. The Stuffed Chicken Wings are a must and the Silver Noodle Pad Woon Sen is better than what Ive had in China Town. Good morning,nI didnt receive your phone call to update me on the status of my pending lab consultation. While I do understand how incredibly busy your office is, I would like to point out how unbelievably insignificant I have been treated as a new patient. Im not sure who runs the office and it bears mention that I have shown up with an appointment only to feel like a drop in. If theres no specialist available to aid in my treatment please let me know. Thanks and God bless.Plus its next to the movie theater! Thai food and a movie, my idea of a killer date!"
1,"Ive been getting my eyebrows threaded at NStyle for about a year or so. I highly recommend getting your eyebrows done by Tania  she might be the best in the city at what she does! She might give you a hard time about how youve been maintaining your eyebrows but she knows exactly what shes doing, so just trust her. My eyebrows look fantastic after every visit, and it makes my whole face look better. Prices are a little high, especially considering that ideally you should go for cleanups in between shaping appointments, but the loyaltypoints program helps with that a little bit.nnThe only other service Ive tried at NStyle was a pedicure, and it was pretty good too. NStyles house brand of nail polish comes in a wide variety of colours and the formula is good, on par with OPI or Essie. The salon is very clean you see employees washing out sinks after theyre used, and taking out new, clean files and cuticle clippers for every customer and my nail tech did a really good job, so Id definitely recommend NStyle over the other, cheaper nail salons you might find downtown or in the shopping centres and underground. It takes a little bit longer, but thats in part because theyre not so busy that they rush customers through a mani or pedi as quickly as humanly possible. They actually take the time to do a good job, which in my mind is better than the cheaper places.nnOverall, the staff is polite, not always super outgoing but never rude and always genuine, and the place is clean. They accept walkins, but I recommend calling ahead for an appointment if you can, especially for an eyebrow threading."
1,"Perfect Selection of quality food.   I had the ahi tuna meal and every bite from start to finish was awesome.  nTheir dining room is perfect for you to show off charlottes history for out of town guest, as they have pictures new and old and lots of facts about Charlotte along the walls. nThey have food for all types of eating, Gluten Free, Vegan, Paleo, however you eat you can find it here."
1,"Came here after reading several great reviews on yelp. This is my my first time in Vegas and the first meal I had here and man oh man it was AMAZING!!! Sat outside and watched the fountain show at the Bellagio. Me and my bf had the chicken liver pate and the onion soup, oz steak with fries, half chicken and mashed potatoes and a large french sangria to drink... AMAZING! Must try! Its worth the wait at the door! And all the servers were super nice"
1,"Very nice cheap quick bus service to airport. X.  but i think ive found out what happens to all the old buses in Seattle, they are shipped to Pittsburgh, old polluting diesel buses seem to be the norm.nnthey also run the inclines, which are pretty cool if not old."
1,"I love getting a tan from Erika. She uses the best products and when I go there I leave knowing my tan is going to last. Love, love, love Botanical tans. If you are into spray tanning, definitely give it a try."
1,"Ive seen several vegas shows and this one was probably my favorite! The acts were amazing and very entertaining to watch. Although the roller skate act made me a little nervous, it also made my jaw drop in awe! I went with three others and we all couldnt stop talking about the show after we left! Very vulgar but we thought it was hilarious. Definitely worth the  in terms of entertainment and value."
1,Taurus moving is a great moving company and I will definitly refer my family and friends!  They showed up on time and the guys were very nice and hardworking.  The price was reasonable but most important it was clear with no hiddenextra charges.  I have heard stories about companies offering a very low rate and then racking up the charges when the work is done.   They worked at a good pace and handled our furniture with care.  I am very pleased with Taurus moving for making our move as painless as possible.  Thanks again!
1,"The SLS HotelCasino is amazing, and this a fantastic place to have beer, food, and watch NFL.  nnI am not much of a carnivore, so I had a caesar salad which was delightfully fresh and had delicious anchovies.  I also sampled fried pickles which were very lightly tempura fried.  nnThey have an impressive beer list and the overall scene is very fun.  NFL football is shown in the beer garden allowing the opportunity to watch patio style.  Always appreciated.  nnFun times and nicely convenient when on strip."
1,"My NYC gateway staple.  Seeing as I am in NY so much, I take Badger Bus from Madisons Memorial Union to Mitchell airport bc I can usually fly from MKE to LGA for around ...  When my schedule allows me to travel I can never seem to find a decent flight out of MSN for under ...  Ugh!nnIve been taking BB for almost  yrs now and its always been clean, drivers respectful and ontime even in these Wisconsin winters and summer construction.nnOW one way from Madisons Memorial Union to Mitchell airport is  but, if you buy it online at least  mins in advance the tickets only ..nnI like it its simple in a complicated world.  nnRide.  nnRelax. nn ...and reap the benefits of the trip.nnSpankii YumYum has spoken."
1,ok... Emily FORCED me ... yeah thats right... FORCED me to eat the mushroom appetizer they were serving at the YELP Birthday Party.  It was actually REALLY good!  I dont eat mushrooms due to my mom forcing them down my throat while I was a kid.  I actually tasted it and ate the whole thing!  If my wife reads this or anyone else... you can call her and ask for yourself!
1,"Overall I was happy with this shop.nnIts always a roll of the dice when you choose a new repair shop. Youre there because you lack either the expertise or the facilities to perform your own car repair, so you are placing your baby in their hands. nnI looked this shop up on AAA, and they are a certified AAA shop that won a Top Shop reward last year. I figured that was relatively low risk, so I brought in my highmileage Mazda whose CEL recently came on. They came back with a timely quote for work performed. They didnt present anything strange or out in left field from what I requested, so I felt secure accepting their quote and having them do the work. I got the impression I was being dealt with honestly, which is a huge plus.nnThe work was performed well and within the time frame they estimated. Overall, good experience. Their labor costs may be a bit higher than average, but it seems worth it for the good customer service experience."
1,"Some of the best dogs Ive had in Arizona. Tried out the regular hot dogs, and all beef jumbo.nnBoth had great flavor and a crunch to the outer skin good char. I also ordered up the Loganberry shake but was not really a fan especially for the price.nnHad the onion rings, and theyre delicious. They dont really feel oily etc.nnOverall, will definitely hit up this place again."
1,amazing an institution in Montreal  !!!nwent over there and had the ultimate experience for breakfast  the mish mash has eggs and anything else you can think of in this omelet nany one that is hungry and wants to hang out at a neighborhood breakfast joint ntrust me this is the best
1,"Cost  wo tip nnCame in and asked for recommendations, got the veggie Spanish omelette as one and decided to order. nAlso ordered the chocolate milk to replenish my calcium supplies but they were out. Then ordered the half applehalf orange juice and they didnt have apple juice. Finally settled for the typical morning breakfast OJ.nnThe omelette was cheesily tasty, with multiple layers and a generous amount of soft gingers embedded within the layers. Combining this egg concoction with the spicy salsa sauce made it even better.nIt was a very filling meal, especially with the tall glass of OJ. nnThe service was great. The waiter was friendly and active in attending to all customers needs. He continually checked in  but thankfully not too often  and was quick in solving any issues. nnOverall, a tad expensive but highly recommended, would come again."
1,Alex Gregoire is an amazing chef. And I can now say a true Frenchman has made me French fries! He brought us almost everything on the menu and I cant remember the French names but it was a taste adventure.
1,"I mean really, who doesnt love a wellcooked piece of chicken, packed between vegetables, and in a bun. You have to love the idea that there is luxury in every bite, I mean its a darn good sandwich.  nnI live in Seattle, we have no ChickFilA... we dont get to taste this wonderful delight, that make people line up in cars, bleeding into parking lot of the neighboring Office Depot, blocking traffic, and generally proving that if you are hungry, there is no good reason to go anywhere else, because you have it right here. nnTake the Deluxe ChickFilA sandwich. nnThe juicy chicken meat is cooked perfectly, in a light batter, and with cheese, lettuce, tomato... you cant best this simplicity, or the flavor why would you want to go anywhere else for lunch.  You get some darn good waffle fries, and a soda.  Sure, its not the healthiest thing out there, but sure beats any burger, in terms of what a good lunch seems, but it wont leave you moody or in a coma. nnHeres where we are, you want to be here, simple, because its good tasting fast food."
1,We rented one of the private rooms and it was an experience Ill never forget. You can turn the music as quiet so you can talk or as loud so you can dance  and we danced up a storm as you want. Needless to say there was a lot of wine and possibly some dancing on the table. It is Vegas after all and this was the ultimate Vegas experience. nnThe service is great as always and it was a really fun way to enjoy a big group. And its not as crazy expensive as you would think. nnThe Seafood sampler  the oysters and crab legs are great. Try the Parmesan fries. And although I didnt try Ive heard the pork belly is great.nnI got the kurobuta double pork chop and it was wonderful just like everything else. Who doesnt love bacon with their pork chop nnWe opted out of dessert because we had so much food. nnOverall if I could do this every time I went to Vegas I would!
1,"I want to give this place  stars! My only regret is that I didnt stuff myself some more. This is what we had and every bit was delicious and amazing! Oh and it was all prepared by Yasu himself! nnFois gras with japanese eggplant crisscut eggplant was the perfect match to the meltinyourmouth fois gras served with a tiny japanese peach that was sweet and cold, so goodnnsalmon belly sashimi yasu style seared i could eat  of these easily.nnuni  squid playful textures, soft uni and chewy squid, almost like coconut jellynnhomemade mochi green tea not your typical mochi! must try. its sweetness was just right and uniform in every piecennmusic and presentation of every dish and overall ambiance was what every sushi restaurant should be. I cant wait to go back there. Yasu, please open up a second restaurant soon! Somewhere in san diego"
1,"I stopped in overnight to see some relatives. I was happy with this Sheraton. The staff was nice, and the rooms were clean, the internet worked  per  hour period, plenty of pillows, enough parking in structure and easy to get to the freeway. One thing that I had a problem with was that the room and bathroom seemed smaller than I would have thought for a Sheraton. The room had two double beds, flat screen TV, desk with a chair and a padded chair. I felt that the room needed a small couch. But it was fine for the time I stayed. nnThe best part of the stay was the water slide. You have to be a certain height to go on. If you are tall enough it will keep you occupied for a few minutes or all day. It is nice because it is away from the large pool. I would stay just for the water slide."
1,"After eating at this place a few times now, I am still torn. Either the dishes were a hit or a complete miss with me. Here are some examplesnnAll the bubble drinks i have gotten have been great!nnThe Ma Pao Tofu was very Americanized. I am used to it with diced pork and much spicier. The Tofu cubes were too big and had cubed carrots and peas, all which authentic Ma Po Tofu does not have.nnThe stinky tofu was delicious. One of the things I always crave when I go back to Taiwan. The Tofu was fried perfectly with a little squeak to it every bite i took. The sauce was sweet and spicy not in the traditional stinky tofu, but still good. Also, the spicy fermented cabbage was a great compliment. nnIll try to update more as I try more dishes! I am willing to give this place more chances as most places here dont even have remotely close to the authenticity that Rose Tea cafe has."
1,"Great great show! Get there early! Get up front at the waiting line by the bar. Line up starts at pm right by the nd floor entrance. you dont wanna be at the back of the theater. its a flat level theater so general admission means st come st serve if you dont upgrade you will be sitting at the rear half. Show is great with a GREAT live band and the best version of Bjorks Oh so quiet.....sh sh other than Bjorks, of course Singing, dancing, contortionists, acrobatics and even burlesque....... all awesome."
1,"I had found this place via Yelp, and meanwhile a friend sent along a list of  best Vegas restaurants, and they were on it! I definitely agree they should be! This was really good. We ordered  tapas plates for  people, and each of them was memorably good. Generous portions for tapas, delicious. Ample parking. Attentive service. There was road construction in the general vicinity, but that amounted to a minor annoyance especially since I wasnt the driver."
1,"I was shopping at Kirklands today, and the cashier made my day! He was funny, witty, and very personable. Not only that, but he saw the coupon I had and knew that the store was offering a better one, and let me use it! He made it a great experience and I got some cute things to decorate for fall! I cant wait! I love the unique things you can buy, and how cheap they are compared to other home good stores!"
1,"I love some good pie and well this is great stuff. Not the best but also not the stuff that tastes like cardboard that you order to your dorm room in college ie. dominoes. The reason I have been going here religiously for the past month is TUESDAY NIGHT TRIVIA. Plus you know, My Man loves the Beer.nnPizza is solid like I said and either veg or meaty it is solid, nuff said. Beer here is pretty vast. Man has tried a couple then found a Blue Point Toasted and that has been his mainstay. Im usually so dehydrated from being at the farmers market that Ill throw back waters all night.nnService is on point. The bartenderdude is a pretty rad guy. Always takes good care. SO ANYWHOOOO this TRIVIA night is pretty fun. Lately they have been doing like decade themes and those are fun. The cool part is the round prize is a pintobeer or  gift card. Yup being smart and knowing useless things can actually pay off who knew? The music is lively and the hosts Evelyn Rose are pretty cool. Yall should come and enjoy this awesome shindig Tue nights!"
1,"ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS GO TO GROOMINGDALESnnnScott and his team at Groomingdales are FANTASTIC. They are always so caring and kind to my babies and Scott is so personable and takes time to talk to every customer.nnI had a very bad experience this week with another groomer and he spent a half hour on the phone with me talking to me about how to help heal my babys wound. I only went to the other groomer because I live in the Southwest now and it is kind of far to see Scott ... BUT LESSON LEARNED PEOPLE!!! I will drive  days to get to Groomindales before I ever go anywhere else again!!! nnThe whole staff is so nice and they make you feel at home regardless if you are a new customer or existing. I have been going to Groomindales now for over  years and when I lost my Frankie in November to Congestive Heart Failure, Scott was so fantastic and supportive and genuinely concerned for my emotional state and for my dogs being without Frankie. nnGroomingdales truly knows how to take care of animals and know what to do with all types of dog breeds what the best ways are to groom them and handle them. nnYou will NEVER be disappointed with Groomindales. Scott is the owner and he is absolutely without a doubt  one of the nicest people I have ever met. nnThe prices are reasonable and you dont feel like you are being taken for granted at all. nnLOVE YOU GROOMINGDALES!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"Thomas Keller, I really wish you were there!n nI love Thomas Keller cookbooks, but never had the chance to visit his restaurants.  Bouchon is the first, and the food and service are overwhelmed in a good way.  I had a great time in this restaurant with my friends.  nnMy friend and I share the appetizer special and entree special.  Yummmmm, super delicious.  The smoke salmon is amazing.  Prime rib just cooked so well.  They really can make food delicious.  Also, my friends love the butter.  We can have nonstop bread with butter all day long.  Bouchon is Bouchon, make every little detail so perfect.nnJust cant wait to go to other Thomas Kellers restaurants."
1,"I recently bought a Halocouture Hair Extension that I love, but my natural hair did not blend well with the cut I had. Since I spent a good bit of money on my Halo I wanted to make sure that it didnt get too cut up in the process of blending my hair with the extensions. nnAfter reading many yelp reviews, I decided on giving the Parlor a try and am extremely happy I did!! From start to finish I have no complaints at all! nnWhen I called I spoke with Randie, she was extremely sweet and patient in listening to why I was making an appointment. After explaining what I wanted, she suggested I make an appointment with Cole.nnWhen I arrived at the Salon this morning, the first thing I noticed was a little sign that had my name listed welcoming me as a new customer a very cute little touch in addition the the salons already great atmosphere.   I was warmly welcomed and offered watercoffee. When Cole came to greet me he was professional and personable. He listened as I explained what I wanted and gave me exactly that! My hair now blends in so nicely with my Halocouture and he was able to keep most of the length! nnI think one of my favorite things about The Parlor was the positive vibe! When Cole asked for another stylist I did not catch her name to help by blow drying my extensions not only was she quick to do so, but Randie also offered to help. Both Randie and the other stylist were so friendly!  nnWhen I asked Cole about his time as a stylist and at the Parlor, he spent a lot of time talking about how much he loves it and all the exciting things The Parlor is doing including Fashion Week. It was such a pleasant experience to see how passionate he is about his profession and The Parlor. nnIve never been one to have a stylist or salon,honestly,  usually I just go wherever is convenient and cheap but am glad to say Im official a fan of The Parlor and Cole! And will be a repeat customer for sure!"
1,"A couple weeks back I drove down to AZ to visit my pledge sister from my college sorority days.  She has been on a quest to find some of the best restaurants in AZ before she moves back home at the end of the school year. The Herb Box popped onto her list after yelping and hearing other talk about it.  She didnt have to twist my arm to go here for Sunday Brunch, especially when she mentioned Red Velvet Pancakes funny thing is I didnt even order them once I saw their yummy menunnMy other friend and I decided to share two dishes, because it isnt every day that we find ourselves in Arizona and there were just too many things to choose just one.  We decided one sweet and one savory to be well balanced!nnnFor the sweetnCinnamon buckwheat pancakes  served with wild blueberries and strawberries, smoked applewood bacon, and whipped honey butter.  I am definitely a fan!  As intrigued as I was by the Red Velvet Pancakes, Im happy that my friend went with these pancakes instead.  They were the perfect balance of sweet and not too sweet.  Also the buckwheat made me feel like I was being a little healthier without it tasting healthier.  Now Im not a bacon fan, gasp yes not everyone loves bacon but everyone else who does like bacon loved theirs.nnFor the savorynI picked the smoked salmon hash  that came with crisp fingerlings, pancetta bacon, scallions, fried capers, aioli, and soft egg.  I know, that I just said I didnt like bacon but I picked a dish with pancetta bacon...but I love smoked salmon so I couldnt resist.  I could definitely taste the bacon but I thought it went well with everything else so I didnt mind.  I really enjoyed this dish and if you likely hearty salty goodness in the morning or for brunch would recommend trying this outnnNot only was the food great their decor was also really fun and stylish.  There was several vintage pieces with a twist that gave it a very modern feel.  Also their bathrooms had some of the most interesting sinks that Im having a hard time describing ...I wish I took a picture.nnOverall, a great find by my friend.  If I lived in Scottsdale, I would go back without a doubt."
1,"Since Im originally from the Bay Area, I can be a bit picky about dim sum but Im generally happy to very happy whenever I go to Changs. The service and selection are good and things are usually fresh and tasty. The only reason Im not giving five stars is because I did get vegetables once that were way overcooked. Thinking about it now, I should have returned them and Im sure they would have gotten me perfectly cooked ones but I had guests and didnt want to make a fuss. My bad. I still go back and have never had any complaints in the three times since."
1,Cheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeese!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Get the English Sausage Rolls and side of cheese! Too die for! nnIm hesitant to give it  stars for fear that word will get out about the gem of a dive bar. Ive never been disappointed by any of the food or drinks weve gotten there. We go regularly for happy hour or late night hangouts. The bartenders are always friendly and they work hard to earn those tips for sure. Its never very crowded and the regulars are a hoot.
1,i came here with my fiancee a little while back.. its one of the more memorable places in all of scotland.. give yourself about  hours to full take in the entire experience.. and dont forget to get their early to avoid the lines..
1,"Stayed at the Paris for fournights with my Girlfriend. All days have been werkdays, so we got a REALLY great deal which was worth the money.nnThe waiting time was okay. I would have been happy to directly get my room card, but i guess thats just a must at the Paris. At least they had several counters opened.nnAfter politely asking for it, we even got ourselfs a little upgrade A room on the st. floor with a great view of the pool, the eiffel tower and the strip, including the Bellaggio Fountains, that looked incredible from up there. In general the view was amazing, day and night.nThe room was the cheapest they offered, called luxuryand i really cant complain Everything was tidy, clean, smelled good. The style is kind of old french, but completely what i expected and what suits the style of a paristhemed hotel. The Bathroom had a walk in shower and a bathtub, which was a bit too small to take a relaxing bath.nnWe didnt really try the food, except from that little bakery. One morning we had coffee and muffins and it was good and the price was vegashotel like, but still ok.nA beer at the bar was about  i think, which is pretty standard for a vegas hotel at the strip. Waiters were friendly and competent.nnThe style of the interieur of the hotel is pretty cool. It has a sky with clouds painted on the ceiling, street lights and old french houses that host the shops and restaurants.nthe casino follows up that style and is nice too.nThe only thing to criticize about the casino is the staff. While the waitresses are cool and offer you free drinks while playing, the roulette dealers we tried our luck on  different roulette tables were pretty annoying. Because were not millionaires, we always bought chips for the minimum price of about . Also, it was our first time playing roulette at a casino. Instead of being friendly or even explayning some of the special rules to us, the staff looked boring, checked their watches every few minutes and was not in the mood for talking or even smiling. That kind of ruined the gambling for us.nBut the hotel itself is great!"
1,"I live in the area and I have somehow never been to Laloux. This restaurant has been around for over  years but I have often overlooked it for newer glitzier restaurants. My wife and I finally went to Laloux a few weeks back and had a wonderful meal. nnIts not your typical French bistro fare but rather modern French food using local seasonal ingredients. My wife had scallops with curried cauliflower and I had duck ways. Delicious. What impressed me the most was the presentation, which was outstanding for a restaurant in this price range. Only downside was the slow service. Definitely recommended!"
1,"Like I have said before, having children makes it nearly a necessary thing to be at McDonalds about once a week. This isnt always for Happy Meals we prefer home cooked food to fast food always  especially for our kids, but I dont mind treating him with a soft serve cone or a Sprite on the way home from the park, or maybe when hes been really good at the grocery store. They also tend to be a good caffeine fix for me when I dont feel like the Bux. nnThis McDonalds is on the way to Grandmas House so we make stops here more frequently than any other on this side of the valley. Weve never encountered any problems more than the occassional broken straw here. Employees are generally pleasant. How much better could a Mickey Ds get?"
1,"I just recently officially purchased my first home. When I submitted my query to lending tree I got several responses relatively quickly. I decided I would see which lender would give me the better rates and customer service so I started the process with multiple lenders to see how much they cared. Mark Christoffersen from Access Capital was by far the most responsive and interested in my home buying process, and he really seemed eager to help me out. The rates from all three were about the same and access capitals fees were slightly lower than the other two lenders I was communicating with, but seeing as how the seller was paying all the closing costs I didnt care so much about the fees. I cared more about using a lender that seemed interested in landing the sale and pleasing their customer. Mark and the team at Access Capital did a really good job of dealing with the subpar escrow company we were forced to work with and I got timely responses from everybody involved. There was an instance of some docs not being received and a couple of delays because of the holidays but nothing that held up the process or caused troubles. Overall, Im very pleased with Access Capital Group and their staff and I would recommend them to friends if they had need of their services."
1,"I love the food here.  Its always a fun spot to go to for a laidback yet upscale meal.  It never seems busy in there for dinner, which is a shame because its a cute restaurant and the food is great!  BF and I came for a dinner date last Friday and sat in a booth in the bar area.  There was a singer performing some laid back wellknown songs.  It was quite empty so we had the place to ourselves.  nnWe ordered ahi tuna tacos, a crab cake and shared a large filet mignon.  I ordered a martini with cantaloupe cant remember the name.  EVERYTHING was delicious.  They even brought us our steak already split up onto two plates for us with our own sides on each plate, without us even asking.  Now THATS what I call customer service.nnI cant wait to go back and eat more food off the menu.  They are a bit pricey but the food is worth it.  nnTheir drinks are also ALWAYS on point.  Yum!  Highly recommended for a date or a small group.  Not really a place to meet and mingle as there was no one there!!"
1,"I visited Vegas for a tradeshow and was taken to dinner at Del Friscos. I had never heard of it except the reviews from my peers that it was the best steak ever.nnWe had a large party  and so we had reservations but had to wait for a table. The place is busy and standing room only in the bar. I had a lemon drop and it was above par.nnWe finally were seated in the corner and had a semiprivate table. The one interesting thing that stood out from highend steakhouses to Del Friscos is that we had  waiters who constantly stood by us.nnThey dished us our sides and were always there to assist with additional beverages or any issues we had. Ive been to other highend steakhouses where the waiter is handson before your meal but then not present until after. I appreciated the extra touch.nnThe steaks were quite large and I had the sirloin. I had the oz and was barely able to finish it as it was a thick cut as well as the large portions of the sides.nnAfter we arrived back to our offices, we received a personal thank you card from Del Friscos handwritten thanking us for visiting and to come back when in town.nnLoved the service, quality of food and the personal touches. I didnt end up feeling like another customer who passed through. Definitely going to spend pp for a meal but a nice place to enjoy a quality steak and get away from the typical diners on the strip."
1,"This is the th time Ive eaten at Asado. Tonight we got to go and tried something different. We got the spin dip for an app... AMAZING. I love this stuff!!!! nFor the main course I got the carnitas burrito. Im pretty picky about carnitas and this was melt in your mouth delicious. Rice and black beans were great as well. The cotija cheese on the black beans is a great touch.nMy husband got the grilled chicken tacos, which he said were excellent. The grilled pepper and onions made it for him.nThe best meal Ive had at Asado was definitely the Chile lime roasted chicken. The chicken itself was tender  juicy. The chipotle mashed are always fantastic and the grilled vegetables add that extra touch of awesome. Oh, and you have to try the nutella empanadas... They are freaking incredible.nEvery time Ive been to Asado the service has really been exceptional. And you cant beat the tamarindo margarita!!!"
1,"First time here and Im super excited that a juice place has finally opened up in my area!  I walked in and the place is a cute small little spot, but very clean and I like the look plus they have a couple of outside tables. I was greeted right when I walked in and the girl at the register was very friendly and helpful... Customer service goes a long way with me  So I decided to go with a smoothie, but they also have juices and acai bowls which look delicious. nI ordered the date nut which reminds me of yummie banana nut bread, which I love! nnJust a heads up for anyone looking to grab the cleanses or bottled juices, they said they wouldnt be getting those for another week or two.nnIll definitely be going back..."
1,"I was in Vegas the weekend before Christmas and apparently many restaurants close this week since its so slow. My friend and I stumbled upon Le Povencal, after visiting  other casinos and we were pleasantly surprised. We didnt have to wait, even though it was saturday night. The hostess greeted us warmly and was very polite.nThe service was great. I wasnt expecting to have personalized service in Vegas, especially in a hotel. I cant remember our servers name, but she said she had worked there for several years. She accomodated any and all of our requests food allergy substitutions, wine reccomendations ect.. with an upbeat, friendly, and knowledgable manner. She was an absolute delight and really made our night! To top it off, we had the pleasure of her singing with another male server. What a treat, dinner and a show!nThe food was delish! The jumbo cheese ravioli with brown butter is amazing! The cheese antipast platter was perfect. The Caprese fresh and delightful! Even the house salad was great.nCompliments to the chef and thanks for giving me a great place to come back to and bring family and friends. Keep up the great job, and mostly, thank you for a great dinner and wonderful evening!"
1,"One of the best hotels offstrip. Convenient to Nellis and ARNG facilities. Rooms are clean housekeepers black light each room but what makes this hotel great is the staff. The extra attention to details is what keeps this experienced business traveler coming back. Great place to stay if you are going to be in town for awhile. The best hotel I have stayed at throughout my travels in the state of Nevada. nnA Special Thanks to Kathy, Vince, Kristen and the rest of the staff for making me feel at home."
1,"The coziest Italian restaurant! I love it like crazy. nnThe Pizza Angelo is amazing, although different. The Calamari is made just right, in my opinion, the marinara sauce that comes with the calamari is even better than the marinara that is topped on the spaghetti. Maybe its the spicy taste. The Tiramisu is very rumified. The Cheese Cannoli is great in a comfort food way. The garlic mozzarella bread is so good, you might just want to eat it all night. The salads arent all that amazing, just salad. nnThe waiters and waitresses are very pleasant. So.. the decor can be overwhelming for some folks, but for others like myself, its immediately lovable. A good suggestion is to come with a group, or at least  peeps. That way, you can taste more varieties without taking home leftovers not that is it bad. Overall, this is a restaurant I go to at least twice a month."
1,"When you need crickets for your gecko and its getting late, and the poor thing has to eat, you can jump in here to grab a dozen or so and get on your way with medium speed.nnSometimes you gotta wait just a bit for the staff to help you out it seems that most pet stores these days are a little understaffed if you get more than a couple of customers in there, but thats only a mild inconvenience when youre shopping for your beloved cricketeater.nnHavent used them for anything else than thatbut most Petsmarts have the same thing this one doesdog food, cat food, birds, reptiles, and all the stuff youll need to keep them properly fed, housed, clean, and even dressed."
1,"Had the Cafe Cebu fried rice, sinigang, free egg roll for checking in  and the banana fritters. Everything was on point! But Id skip the egg rolls unless theyre free of course LOL. Ive eaten at most Filipino places in the southwest and this is definitely the best."
1,"My partner brought me here for my birthday last year and I brought him here for his birthday this year. It is a bit far from us, so we make a special occasion out of it.nnThis is really unique place with very unique food. I love the Curry Waffles and Supreme Nachos! My partner ate the this Red Beet Burger that was very special. It was really red and yummy. I have to ask them to VEGANIZE them because they have like  dishes with eggs, but they are always accommodating. nnThe place is super cute with homemade desserts that are always vegan. Across the street is the parking lot with the most awesome graffiti that I always like to take pictures of. I love the area. We walked around the streets before and after dinner. There are little fruit and veggie plants that are being planted all the time in the front yards of the restaurant. I heard the owner walks and waters them every day. That is AWESOME.  If you drive a little bit, you will see a green bike lane! They really put a lot of effort to making the space very nice...nnThe price is fair and reasonable. I do hope they expand their menu though. It is a bit small, but I do love their breakfast choices. It is awesome to see Vegan varieties like that."
1,"Amazing place and for an amazing price..I dont know what anyone is complaining about except the roach person this place for.  Look at the pictures, the portions are good, the sushi is fresh AND HALF PRICE ALL DAY!, beer is a PENNY Friday and Saturday nights and AYCE not only sushi, but apps like BUTTER CALAMARI and entrees too!!  nnI will be bringing my family back, and my friends for sure, in fact, I think I will be going here for my birthday next month!  Thank you for places like this, who keep great food affordable in this economy, we need all the help we can get."
1,"i really didnt expect this much from THIS mall. it didnt look like much from the outside, but i was pleasantly surprised. the design of the palce is pretty cool. this probably isnt the best shopping considering all the shopping options in vegas. i would say this is a better shopping option for the younger generation. its also conveniently located right on the strip. right across the street from bellagio and connects to the planet hollywood casino. you can just walk down from your hotel room if youre staying in planet hollywood. nnthey a lot of the popular stores like HM, footlocker, champs, urban outfitters, etc. also a lot of good eats like oyster bay, ocean one, and blondies.nits also a good hangout for watching basketball games haha. they have a circular bar right in the middle of the mall with  plasmas. the LA FAKERS and celtics were playing on christmas day, a large crowd just hung around there and cheered loudly for their team, cool vibe"
1,"I have worked with Marzette on a photo shoot. It was great! There are a few things that stand out for me when I look for a makeup artist to hire for a photo shoot. n.They cant be a flake! Marzette was very prompt, showing up a little early even!n. The work has to be great! We did a shoot for a mens cosmetic line and she did a great job making the men feel comfortable and look better, but not over done. Great for photography.n. They have to be easy and fun to work with! Finally The WoW Factor was easy to get along with, accommodating and full of fun ideas! nnGreat for me! Great for you!"
1,"My husband and another couple attended a class on  and we had a great time! Anthony was our instructor and he was great! We painted the bridge scene and although the it looked difficult, he made the class fun, the painting doable for all of us and all four of us really enjoyed him. We look forward to going again! We cant wait to go back for the Pop Art Your Pet class"
1,"Wow, I cant believe I am becoming such a Fox Concept Restaurant fan.  This is another winner.  I am on a no carb diet and the options here are amazing.  If you want healthy and tasty fare, this is the place to come.  I love, love the chopped vegetable salad with the grass fed steak or the salmon.  After my first introduction to this place, I realized I had been three times in one week.  I had to make excuses to drive to the area, so I could go eat there.  It is a good  to  miles from my home in far north Scottsdale yes, that is where BFE is.   I had a taste of the avocado hummus and it was delicious.  My kids and husband had the little lemon cake and they devoured it.  My salmon was perfectly cooked last time I was there.  I love their teas, specially the acai hibiscus one, cant wait to try the lemonades."
1,"Ive been to the one in NYC, which took a wait of over  hours to get into, and yeah, the frozen hot chocolate was good....but dang....a  hour wait...in a tight, cramped place!nnI was excited to see that there was a Serendipty in Vegas. The decor was beautiful and it was roomy and spacious! My friends and I had the chicken fettucini with chicken, pot pie, and the burger with brie and avocado. We were all fans of our food! So, so, good. We also had a pina colada mixed drink that was beyond incredible!nnBesides the good food and drink, our wait was about  minutes and we had awesome service! Check it out!"
1,"Best place to eat breakfast in Henderson, especially if you like Benedicts andor Hashes.  Great for lunch as well, but definitely our favorite breakfast spot in Henderson!  As busy as it always is, they still manage to have great service as well!"
1,"Ah Tommys, you either love it or hate it. If you like greasy, caloriepacked, delicious fast food and like reflecting poorly on your diet plan, then Tommys is the place to go. You cant go wrong with a doublecheeseburger with chilicheese fries! Tommys is by far one of the best burger joints on the west coast, easily up there with innout, possibly better. The chili resembles something that you can buy in a pet aisle, but it makes up for its awful looks in its personality like that one girl in college that always wondered why you never wanted to hang out in public with her. Not too spicy, not too mild, a perfect taste and an ultimate addition to any of their meals. nn     If you arent that thirsty dont buy a large drink, its big enough to get you five years in prison if you walked outside with it in New York. But if youre willing to take on the bucket of carbonated sugarsyrup than by all means go to town. Dont pay too much attention to the bad reviews on here, some people just dont appreciate a tantalizing meal like Tommys can serve up! The only reason Im giving it  stars is because of location. VERY eyecatching, but the parking lot holds only a handful of cars, so youll have to park a little ways away, but youll need to burn the calories anyways. So whether youre heading home from work or taking your prom date out for the fancy meal shes waited her whole highschool career for, Tommys is most definitely the place to go, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
1,"Hands down the best lounge in USA and I mean USA only! nnI travel a lot and have been through many perks in my life while traveling. My parents are both million mile flyers  Weve been to HK lounge w full on buffet  lots of different perks. But weve never seen something like this within USA. nnThis has to be hands down the best lounge with actual food served. nThe place opened  weeks ago with a full on staff of chefs. I heard that the food that they use are all organic. Everything is served fresh from am to midnight. What else can you ask for? Well, full on bar without charge! you can ask for all kinds of drinks alcohol or nonalcohol  coffee. Servers comes to serve or they assist you to what you need. nnThe have office on hand for meetings  family room for parents to play with kids. nYou can also check out tablets to use while your stay. Oh, did I mention crazy internet speeds? nnSince I only have  visits, after the , it would be charged. I wouldnt rate this a  if i had to pay for the service all my perks are free since were all million mile flyers."
1,"I adore this gaming store. As a female gamer it can be hard to find a good gaming store that doesnt smell and where all the employees dont stutter and stare at your boobscoughGamersInncough.nnGame Depot is nothing like that. It is the most super awesome game store ever. It is clean, well lit, smells nice, nice bathroom. Ok, so Im a little obsessed with the ambiance of my game stores.nnThere is also an excellent selection of games and minis and books and toys and everything my geeky little roleplaying heart desires. Patty the owner is always willing to help me find something new. She has an amazing ability to not only recall the names of most of her customers but also their gaming preferences.  She is also always willing to order something if they dont have it.nnI love coming here and I even enjoying playing games in the store. They host a great DnD and I just recommend this place to everyone."
1,"stars I was upgraded to a remodeled suite, the entire living room and bedroom had new carpet and furniture. The view was incredible of the Wynn towers and the golf course. nnI worked out a couple of mornings in the fitness center but noticed several machines were inoperable. Service at the club lounge and front desk were stellar as usual.nnDownstairs the bar and lounge area is now another restaurant called Grill . I didnt experience the place this time but it looked inviting with the new decor.nnIll continue to stay here in the future  the Renaissance Hotel is quaint, has no gaming, offers solid service and the suites are comfy."
1,"Amazing happy hour! The miso eggplant forever changed me! It was delicious!! The beef rolls were also great!! I didnt like the tomato roll, but surprisingly the Hubby really did, so it must be a matter of taste  We got stuffed for under  on the strip for dinner, and thoroughly enjoyed our meal!! Big time score!!"
1,"I used to cycle past this place on the way to uni, and always felt hungry as the scent of bread baking and... something else... teased my senses. I stupidly didnt know what this was for quite a while there was just a car park with a couple of cars close to this seemingly empty building. Then I saw some people entering.nnIt would seem that you must first reach this remote destination hidden behind the east park side residential area, then enter the building through the humble little door, walk up a brief staircase, and enter a very cute rustic cafe, which just so happens to be vegetarian. The concept behind the place is really ethical, as people with learning disabilities are employed and offer internships, get some exposure to the catering industry, and build confidences.  nnEthics aside, foodwise, this is a real find. They have changing daily menu, and often choices include jacket potato with a variety of filling options, soup of the day, veggie burger,  pizza, toasties, thai green curry, and a variety of other local and more exotic dishes. All the bread is freshly made downstairs, as is the tofu that other nice smell I said I couldnt quite put my fingers on. You can buy loaves which come in various shapes, sizes, flavours and types. The tofu is also for sale, and available smoked, marinated, plain, or in burger form, ready to cook at home. Besides savoury food, there are a good variety of cakes available, some of which are vegan vegan carrot cake with cream cheese frosting and vegan chocolate fudge cake!nnThe prices are very reasonable, and there are many places to sit. The close quite early and sometimes the hours can be unpredictable, check on their website to avoid being disappointed!nnif you dont want to come all the way over the New town, you can find some of their products like tofu cheese and bread at the castle terrace farmers market on a Saturday morning."
1,"I found Lees Paining  Drywall otherwise known as M handyman on Yelp. Michael, the owner, was easy to work with and communicated oftenas needed both before and during the project. Michael quoted us a fair price, got started immediately and even worked Saturday and Sunday. His team did a great job on our home, and made sure that we were completely happy with everything before they finished. I actually liked having the crew there because they were all really downtoearth and likeable guys who just happen to paint much better than I could..  Oh, they all love dogs which made our life easier as well. In another post, Ray G. explains the process of how Michael works out the paymentpaint costs."
1,Had a great date night with my husband. The macadamia nut halibut was wonderful. Server was great and gave us plenty of personal space. We told him we were not in any hurry and he respected that. My only concern was the abrupt rude hostess when I called to make the reservation. Not friendly or welcoming at all. But on a good note the bartender and waiter made up for the lack of the hostess. Food was wonderful!
1,"X MARKS THE SPOT!nOct . Just had the most enjoyable lunch. A delightful Salmon BLT, with potato salad. The atmosphere was relaxing and intimate. Our server, Carley, was polite, professional, courteous, and displayed a knowledge of how the dishes were prepared.  I found the menu to be refreshing and inviting.  I will be back to try The Spot Burger and Gorgonzola chips......in addition to the Adult Beverages.  Thanks Tiger."
1,"I cant stress how incredible the Big Burrito group is. They deserve prizes.nnI came to Soba with two friends for the Oc Om Boc festival, and was pleased to order and eat the pricefixed  fourcourse meal they offered. Delicious pho, egg rolls, spring rolls, duck confit, duck breast, noodles, beef and rice, fresh vegetables, and an incredible dessert of cake with a hint of banana and a vanilla wafer.nnThe lights were turned low, there was a wall with running water streaming down from the top, and there was some contemporary playlist in the background playing all of your NPR favorites David Gray, Radiohead. As an added bonus, the paper towels in the bathroom were EXCELLENTI felt so guilty wiping my hands on them and throwing them away.nnThe menu is a bit pricey, but I dont think Im experienced enough to judge its price vs. the food...Im just a pretty broke college student who spends all of his expendable income on nice places like Soba."
1,"Absolutely incredible steak and a great meal overall. The Golden Nugget had a ad in the room that you can take the restaurant where you get an appetizer I got the Wedge Salad, main course oz  filet mignon and mash potatoes for me and a desert Went with the chocolate cake for less than , a great deal. It was one of the best steaks Ive ever eaten, no joke. nnThe side that you get is more than enough for two people, so my wife and I ordered two different sides, she got the creamed spinach, both were excellent. The service of course is top notch. I didnt eat much of the desert, not only because I was really full from the meal, but the chocolate cake was really too rich for me. However, I loved the steak so much, I could have cared less about the cake!nnIt is pricey of course, but if youre staying on Fremont and want to go all out for one a great meal, this is a good spot to do it!"
1,"Truly exceptional .......plate by plate, Chef Chris is sure to delight your palette with his fantastic flavors and fresh ingredients. Go there, just not on the days I want to go back...I dont need you getting in my way!"
1,"This is a wonderful find, the food warms the soul, its affordable and the portions are gigantic. This place has it going, and we cant wait to go back, I just hope more people find it and it stays in business. Please go, you wont regret it!"
1,"I LOVE Vegas....ahhhhh Im super excited to go back this spring  Treasure island damn you gots some comfy beds! Ok so the last time i was here was Halloween weekend, it was sooo much fun we went to the Christian Audigier club which is located in the hotel and it was packed and if you are staying at Treasure Island you get in for free! The rooms are super nice Flat screen TV, Nice modern Decor and we had the room facing the Siren Show which i didnt get to see it cause we were so busy but i did get to see a little of the Fireworks they did that was part of the show. Service was good always had clean towels and bed made everyday! The hotel is located right across from the Fashion show mall,Wynn,Venetian and Mirage! I will be back!"
1,"Making it okay to have seafood in phoenixnnYes, yes, that sounds like an awful thing to say! But it really is true, I have had some fabulous seafood dishes in phoenix and some that left a bit to be desired. A group of us came here for the prefixe menu. You get an entree and a regular size app for a fixed priced. Its actually a really good deal considering this place is err a little on the pricey side.nnWe sit down and everyone is super nice! As we wait for our orders, we are brought out some spicy thai like edamame. It was delish!nnBefore talking about my meal, lets talk about how absolutely knoweldgeable our waitress was. I hate I cant remember her name, but she was SUPERB.. I always say it is nice when you talk with someone who knows the menu down to how the best way to serve it is i.e. fish should be medium because it loses flavor the longer its cooked but offered flexibility when I wanted my potstickers well done texture always gets me.nnMy group has the crunch golden pot stickers and calamari  fantastic! They are really setting the tone for me.  For my entree I had the Roys Original Hawaiian Blackened Island Ahi  this was mahvelous and cooked to absolute perfection. The spicy mustard that accompanied with it took it over the edge! Everything else my group ordered was good as well. People had no complaints which is hard to do in big groups.nnLast but not least, dessert. There was some chocolate goodness and something else. Im not a big fan of desserts, but for those who are.. these were quite tasty!nnWould totally go back and Mondays made it way more reasonable."
1,"This place is simply amazing.  I wish it were in my neighborhoodId be here on the reg.nnThe guy who was working here was polite and seemed v. knowledgeable.  I felt kinda weird ringing a bell to have my order taken, like I was rudely summoning a butler or something but I guess it IS more efficient!nnI had the ice tea that looks like a glass of beer and it was amazing.  Everything here is beautiful.  The decor is great, it doesnt take a turn for the cornily ethnic white people gone native look similar establishments tend to take on.  nnOne of the best spots on state street!"
1,"ok, I have eaten here a few times. My wife has eaten here once a week since they have opened. nnOverall, the idea and concept is great. Good food at fair prices. The cocktails and wine are all reasonable. I have had great dishes and bad dishes chicken and dumplings. nnThe food to me is  stars. I can never get a consistent meal.  good meals  bad meals,  average meal. I know what to order now and what to stay away from. If your looking for outstanding food...this is not for the foodie. Its good comfort food. nnThat being said! What makes this place stand out is the service and management. They have always gone out of there way to be a step up on every body else. They always greet us and the owner is willing to come by and chat about food, wine, service, or any thing else you want. The service to me is  stars. nnIf you want the best relaxed experience sit at the bar and enjoy the scenery of the hustle and bustle of the restaurant. The bartenders are great and always engaging. nnI wish them continued success!"
1,I usually prefer Harkins but AMC does have the lead during week days.  movies really cant be beat if youre bored one weekday! I like the stubs program especially now that its discounted to join...the points add up fast! Hopefully one day theyll have the other half of the theater open again.
1,"Great experience at Flemings Phoenix.nnIve wanted try Flemings for some time.  We have one in my home town of Walnut Creek, CA., but have not yet got around to it.nnOn a recent business trip to Phoenix our hosts treated us to dinner at Flemings. We started with an array of appetizers. All very good. For my entree I had the rib eye and I have to say it was perfection! Cooked as I ordered and seasoned perfectly. The mashed potatoes and green beans were very good too. Desert was carrot cake. Im not a big fan of carrot cake, but as far as they go Im sure it was great.nnThe server was attentive and very friendly. Also, I ordered horseradish on the side and he remembered without being reminded. I dont take that for granted anymore. nnThe location was a bit strange. Its located in a strip mall. Im accustomed to a Flemings being in cool, unique locations. But maybe its a Phoenix thing. Everything is located in a strip mall in Phoenix.nnIve eaten at Mortons and Ruths Chris many, many times. Flemings is my new favorite and will have my steakhouse business going forward."
1,Ruby Tuesday is great!   I seriously give them an A.  The restaurant has an overall clean and appealing look...we are always made to feel welcome and the service is always wonderful. The salad bar is always crisp and fresh. Today I had the Petite Sirloin and Lobster Tail. The steak was cooked perfectly at just the right temperature. The Lobster was fresh and melt in your mouth delicious. the baked potato was huge! This makes several visits now to this restaurant and they deserve my solid A grade! I travel to northern Nevada Reno area often and I only wish theyd open one there.
1,"If youre having a craving for tofu soup, Mr. Tofu is the way to go! nnThe environment is very kick back, quiet, and casual. The service is decent too. It was a little slow when we went because there were only two servers at the time and they were doing all the prep work, serving, and cleaning. But they were still very attentive and nice so props to them! nnWe ordered the combination tofu soup and the bibimbap. The soups were so good!! The only thing is that the soup doesnt come out boiling hot like Im used to but thats just a preference. The bibimbap was okay too. A little on the bland side but its still good. nnOverall it was a good experience and well be coming back again when were in town."
1,There are few times in life when you will be shopping for an Engagement ring and i was Finally in the market for one. I went to three locations prior to walking into Galicias fine jewelry in scottsdale. my Prior experiences before going to Galicia fine jewelry were nothing but Confusing and feeling pressured. The staff at Galicias were Amazing And needless to say on that day i walked out with the most beautiful ring for the Most beautiful and deserving woman in my life. Thank you Galicia For making my day an my life special.
1,"We kept it simple... a cheese plate  the Wurst Plate.   All of it was outstanding, great cheeses  the various meats went well with the cheese.    nnThe service here is surprising good considering how jammed packed it was during a Sunday Brunch.   Our drink glasses never came close to being empty and when we did need something, the wait staff was on top of it.   If you happen to get a window seat, its actually a nice view of the Capitol Square!"
1,"I loved the Trump for many reasonsnn. Its quiet. I needed some sleep, stat.n. Jet tubs  TVs in the mirror.n. No smoking, no casino, no screens flashing all around you.n. Service was almost as good as the Four SeasonsnnWhy they dont get  starsnn. They dont have enough umbrellas or shade by the pool. This is Vegas. Im pale. And its hot. My pool time was cut short because of this. Not cool. n. The room was void of robes and they ran out of the wine I ordered. However, they did refund my resort fee when I mentioned how I wasnt completely relaxed because of this. n. The free wifi was slow. I hate slow Internet. nnI think its a great hotel if you prefer somewhere a bit off the strip, expect great service and dont want the noise and smell of a casino."
1,"Saigon Pho on Alma School in Chandler should never be compared to anyone else using that name. We went there last night for the thousandt time and still loved the food, menus and taste. This place is a clean no frills friendley and fast service restaurant. Not only is the food terrific it taste good and almost everything on the menu is under .. Yeah I said . it  not a typo. We had an opening of fried Salt and Pepper Squid or Calamari for you Italainas and of course iot was tender and crispy with a geneous portion. I also had to order the Saigon Noodle soup that has Oxtail, Tendons and meatballs which sounds weird but taste out of this world. That bowl in itself is hard for a big guy to finish. That was .. Ridiculously affordable as I could see with whole familie od  eating in the next didning area.nDepending on the day they also can have live lobster, Tilapia, Crab and so on.nNot all the food is made with Oxtails or Tendons so if you not adventurous theres plenty to choose from thta well worth ordering. Try The Cuury Chicken soup with Chicken, Curried Brith, Basil, Bean Srouts and Jalepenos. Way over the top, Huge and oh so delicious. This is one little restaurant  thats worth the drive from wherever you are."
1,"I really like this park.  I visited the park  or  times a week prior to my move across town, and I miss the amenities.  With newly renovated tennis courts, batting cages, and an indoor soccer facility there are a ton of activities.nnThe farmers market is nothing to get excited about in my opinion.  There are only a few vendors and none of them are memorable."
1,"Came here on a Friday night after a bike ride. As an Irish bar, there is a lot of whiskey on the wall, but they can make whatever you need. The food was a hell of a lot better than I thought it was going to be. nOn the encouragement of the bouncer, I ordered the wings which were meaty but Ive had better. What I should have gotten was the shepards pie.  of my friends got it, and it was VERY good. Im going to go back, just get it on my own. nLastly, this place dishes out cheap, strong drinks. Good place to get sauced before hitting a club."
1,"This place has EXCELLENT street tacos. The Carne Asada taco is one of the best I have had perfectly seasoned, grilled and perectly tender. nnFYI for anyone who hasnt gone yet when you are looking out for the restaurant the first time you go, make sure you look for Tacos Saguaro that is what the sign says for some reason Yelp has the name spelled wrong."
1,"They serve water in metal cups which was odd because it throws off your palate. For a place focused on the wine experience thats a faux pas.  Who wants the taste of metal on their mouth just before sipping a new glass of wine? Easily remedied though by an extra wine glass for water.nnThe charcuterie didnt have as much variation in flavor between the different meats as Ive experienced at other places.  I would give it three stars as an appetizer.  Needed a lot more bread crisps to go with it as well.  They gave us ... You dont just eat it plain because its so heavy.nnI had the filet and it was cooked perfectly.  The wine reduction was great.  French fries are also super tasty, a small portion that keeps you wanting more.  I wasnt crazy for the haricot vert but thats because I dont like undercooked green beans and theyre always like that.  nnOur waitress raised my review a star.  Would definitely go back to try more on the menu because of the ambience and service was excellent from start to finish."

1,"Lyrics  Phil Collins  In The Air TonightnnI can taste it going to Bianco tonight, Bo BitesnAnd Ive been waiting for this location to open all my life, Bo BitesnCan you taste going to Bianco tonight, Bo Bites, Bo BitesnnWell, if you told me you were hungrynI would lend a handnIve seen your appetite before my friendnBut I hope you know who I amnnWell, I was there and I saw what you didnI saw it with my own two eyesnSo you can wipe off your mouthnI know what youve eatennIts all been a plate of pies pizzannCame here for a quick HH drinks with a buddy!nnHowever, when in Pizzeria Bianco you have to order a pizza!  It would be sacrilegious not to!  Im not too fond of the draft selections since there were only , but I guess I shouldnt expect too much from a wine and pizza joint.  We ordered the Margarita Pizza.  Overall, it was pretty good  firewood baked pizza pie in a stone oven you really cant beat that quality!  The aroma of the basil, the stringy mozzarella cheese, and the sweetness of the tomato sauce is enhanced by the toasty smell of the firewood! Yum!  nnThe service was very good!  There were several people that attended to us, but seem like they were all in sync and willing to help to make our experience so much better!  The place itself is different from the one downtown.  This one had more of a farm home feel with a touch of spring!  In the end, a must visit next time your around the Biltmore area!  Enjoy!"
1,"Excellent food, unique in the best way possible. Try the specials, they rock. This place has a great atmosphere and scratch made food. This is what your Grandma would make if she was Polish and had the chops of a Michelin chef. You will be surprised and will come back. Oh and the soups are exactly what any good polish place would have."
1,"the room we got was very nicenview st floor with a view of the stripnbeds comfy, with fluffy beddingnbathroom large and decently litnnthe pool was fantastic. love the lazy river!nthe selection of restaurants inside MGM is pretty awesome too."
1,"This place is great. I recently moved to Tempe, and have been looking around for a smoke shop. I walked into Smoke World, and I knew that it was the place. It was clean, fully stocked, and there were a ton of glass pieces. I asked the owner if he had any foldable hideaway pipes, and he instantly pulled out a great selection. I ended up getting a rastacolored wooden folding pipe. This store is great!"
1,"I was amazed, but concerned that if I tell you my masseuse you will ask for her and I will not see her again. Well I cannot hold it from you, Sarah was her name and when I proposed after there was no responce but trust me she was incredible. I had a deep tissue massage and for a big guy she realy helped me with my multiple stress knots. Thank you Sarah."
1,Went back.   This time I tried the fusion tacos.  They were wonderful.   You can taste the Korean meets with the Mexican sauces and ingredients.   It is a very unique and wonderful union of two great foods that normally you would not expect to be combined.    We also got the fried rice.   It was excellent.   Usually its hard to get a table during lunch time and thus we went a bit later and it was no problem.   The service and food were both amazing.
1,"I really enjoyed my ribs, side salad and baked potato with the works. The service was better a couple of weeks ago when we went but whatever. I love the sauce on the ribs and my brother loved his big ravioli  and my dad enjoyed his chicken sandwich. This place hasnt been around for as long as it has for nothing the food is good!"
1,"My friends and I came here after the Rock n Roll marathon, and we were surprised the place still opened late! I am usually not a beef type of girl unless its shabu or hot pot or something. Im boring when it comes to steak houses...just give me a filet mignon, and Ill be happy. Like, how can you go wrong with one of the most tender cut of beef, right? But at Mon Ami Gabi, how can you go SO right with it that all other ones you had became eh??  The piece of filet mignon was small as usual like most other steak houses, but the char on this one was superb. Not to mention the merlot glaze totally compliments it! The frites that come with it filled over  of the plate, but they shaped a bit flat, but super delicoius and crisp! Dip them in the merlot sauce, and theyre still good. The french green beans, as a side, was so buttery! nnThe service was just okay though. The waitress came back occasionally but not noted to details like few of us need our water refill and so forth."
1,"I recently rented a car from Budget Las Vegas and had a great experience. Since I travel to Las Vegas several times a year for business, it is always nice to receive fast and great service when renting a car. Thanks!"
1,"We stopped by for what looked good and got an apple turnover with sesame brittle that chewy sesame and sugar syrup mixture that resembles a Chinese candy, and it was so good. We saved a kouign amann for later eating, but as we have been trying to learn over and over and over again, pastries are best when fresh so dont buy them if you dont think you can finish them. I wish this shop were closer to home... in NY."
1,"The smells from the kitchen are just amazing, great quality steak selection, intimate wine room for a group, and the BEST dessert in all of Phoenix. The service is a little fast for my taste at this price range, but the butter cake...you just cant say no to..."
1,"The hype for this place is everywhere so I decided to check it out with some coworkers. It was absolutely hyped for a reason. One of the best places in Las Vegas to get a burger!nnI ordered the Farm Burger. It was a sesame see toasted bun, with fried egg, english sharp cheddar, and duck breast bacon. It was cooked perfectly and melted in my mouth! The egg was cooked well and their was yolk in every delicious bite. The duck breast bacon good, but I expected it to be more savory. Its okay though because the burger made up for it!!nnFor appetizers we got parmesan truffle fries, jalapeno poppers, and wings. The truffle fries were the best out there. Lots of parmesan cheese and the best part of all was their house ketchup sauce. It worked amazing with the fries. The jalapeno poppers were good too. They came in a cheese sauce that cooled down the spice. The chef included seeds in one popper making it a game of roulette for which one had it. It came down to the last one! I split it with my coworker and it was spicy!nnThe wings I werent a fan of. They bring out a duo, one more traditional buffalo and the other wasabi style. The cool thing is they scrape away some of the meat so you dont get your fingers very messy and can hold the wing by the bone. But unfortunately neither style of wings worked for me. The traditional had a good spice but it wasnt anything great. I took one bite of the wasabi and that was it. It wasnt spicy at all, but kind of sweet and it just didnt work for me at all. nnAll in all I plan to return and soon. The menu is decently priced, better than I was expecting. The food was amazing and I can truly say they do a burger right."
1,"They are friendly enough and service was good.  Bread was decent, pesto sauce was good but could have used either salt or parmesan.  Fusilli Bolognese was actually rotini, but good.  I really like the sauce.  It could have used a little parsley for freshness and color.  The cheese ravioli Im not too big of a fan of, the sauce is watery and salty and it wasnt great?  But its not a dish I favor and my friend says that its not mushy like it typically is so it might be a good version.  Will definitely go back."
1,"I went today and they had some great beer at some great prices. It was happy hour so they had  pints. Lots of fun stuff to do like darts, pool, video games. The staff was very friendly and they had an awesome dog."
1,This is a cool place to sit and enjoy a cup of coffee.  They roast and sell their own coffee so it does not get any fresher than this.nThe place is cool with a great combination of AC and ceiling fans that makes you feel more outside in a good way!nThe coffee was great and there is even a pool table needs a coin though.
1,"Had a blast here! My group got a cabana here and partied with vivid lasting memories... Yes, the clubs main concern seems to be a lack of a bigger or designated dance floor due to its outdoor relaxed environment. Well we say screw it! Just got a bunch of girls and started a dance floor in front of our cabana area with a stripper pole right by! Came in handy I must say"
1,"Wow!  Local moms you have to get here ASAP!  The food offerings look amazing. I saw some grab and go that needs to be in my fridge now. nnHowever, I only came in for a quick cup of coffee. The cashier encouraged me to try the lavender infused honey latte. Amazing. Great recommendation. nnBoth the owners were in there wow!  What inspiring, kind and fantastic women. nnGive this place a try!"
1,"I walked in and first noticed the spacing and style of the place. I liked it. I ordered the honey vanilla latteless sweet and iced. It was great! The hint of honey was just right and not too sweet. Unfortunately I didnt have the friendliest barista when my order was taken...but she perked up when she have me my order. Hopefully next time I go, the person who takes my order will be a little nicer and more inviting. And gonna try a pastry!"
1,"Great customer service.  Talking about getting a refill when your water is low, this place refills it every time you take a gulp out of it.  And you know how you hardly ever get a how was the food? is there anything else you need? or get any attention when youre at a Chinese restaurant, well, you wont get that here.  Youll get all the attention you need.  Their BBQ pork ribs are a mouth watering dish, full of flavor and just cooked enough to be tender and not falling off the bone.  Fried Chilean Sea Bass was terrific.  Very expesive place though, I guess it comes with the territory.  So expect to put out at least  for party of .  Would come back here any day if I have the money for it."
1,"Pupusa addict back... Ive visited this location a few times since my last review and had a few things to say...nnThey are starting to take a while to serve people. The past two times i have went we waited quite a bit for our food, yes we are glad business is booming, how about hiring more people please? Thank you"
1,"nnWhile I immediately signed up for the free loyalty account online in July , this was my first time watching a movie here.  I could kick myself for waiting all this time to find out what all the fuss was about!  I entered the theater lobby through the Tanzy entrance, so I passed the concession stand to my right and the wraparound couch with the wine kiosk to my left to get to the box office to redeem one of my  premium plus seating passes I received at the Yelp Elite event held at Tanzy back in December.  Yes, they were inside those delightful gift bags that very fortunate Yelp Elite members get to take home after having such a wonderful time at these events!  I was going for the p Thursday showing of Jack, the Giant Slayer, so besides the couple that arrived before me, and who were being taken care of by a clerk, I was the only one waiting in line, and I didnt have to wait very long.  While it was nice not to have to wait for more than a minute, or two, I can see how these lines could get very long and tiresome during peak times, so I suggest you book your tickets online, or via mobile not only to avoid waiting in long lines since theres only room for two clerks to wait on people, but to make sure you can select the seats you want!  Ive been to Ultra Star and Studio Movie Grill before, so I was familiar with the seat selection process, but if youve never been to either of these theaters, then visiting for the first time with only a few minutes to get through the ticketing process before the movie starts might make the whole experience a little stressful.  Be wise, and take some time now to check out www.ipic.com and familiarize yourself with the theater to maximize your theater enjoyment!    nnAfter greeting me a warm welcome and asking me if Ive ever been there before, I answered with a no, she then asked me for my surname.  Btw, everyone here is so friendly, before, during, and after the movie!  After giving her my name, I was reminded that I did sign up for the loyalty program a few years ago, which then gave me a little jump seeing how long this theater has been open!  Soon after this process and with ticket in hand, I found my way to auditorium  and quickly located my luxury seat.  Oh, my goodness!  I knew already that this was quickly going to be one of my favorite theater venues, and after settling down onto my seat and handed my free popcorn and D glasses, and my request for a glass of water, I knew that I was in for a terrific treat!  And then, the D trailers started to play... OH, BOY!  nn for premium plus seating, with no price difference between regular and D films, is a gorgeous steal when you consider everything youre getting in return free popcorn for you popcorn lovers, a pillow, a lux blanket, AND a seat with a button that, upon depressing, raises your legs so that youre able to recline as if laying down in a firstclass airplane cabin.  The D glasses I received provided me the BEST D movie experience outside of D IMAX . for Avatar at Harkins Arizona Mills and a D Immersion experience an additional  for a , or minute film per person with an admission ticket to Baltimores National Aquarium.  Most theaters charge at least  for a D experience that, at least for me, can be a hitormiss, and then, for those who absolutely need it at the movies, a small bag of popcorn, which can cost you at least  elsewhere, so add another , you get a personal bed, complete with a pillow and blanket, and the chance to enjoy a D film with what must be stateoftheart D glasses!  I so wished I saw Life of Pi D here...nnFrom the moment the trailers began, I had a feeling I found THE place Im going to watch D at the movies from now on at iPic!  And after taking a quick look at the cocktails menu, I know what Im going to try on my next visit, which I will dutifully post a photo of, and it will be very soon, so stay tuned!  nnp.s.  Free valet with your paid, or gifted, premium plus ticket!  nn Great movie, considering everything youve read of the childrens classic fable, and for all of the special effects, the only way to see them, at least for me, is multidimensional!  Im looking forward to seeing more D films here."
1,"I have turned into a metrosexual.  My wife says I enjoy the spa experience more than she does.   I have no problem parading my naked Asian body around natural lighting, cascading waters, and steamy saunas, until I fall limp on a lounger.nnAs has been mentioned by many others, the spa here is luxurious.  The towels are plush, ample space in the steam room and sauna,  bottled waters galore, a gallery of toilets, a hushed waitingsleeping area with good tea and delicious refreshments, before you are ushered through a nondescript door into a dazzling nirvanalike corridor of treatment rooms.  There are a few different showers, one of which is a cascading waterfall.  The jacuzzis have high pressure sprouts around your ankles, so you can massage your own calves.  Finally, there are the warm stone loungers, where you can read the newspapers or assorted magazines available, alit by natural lighting from a skylight.   There is so much attention to detail, down to the ripeness of the fruit, that I was quite taken aback.  nnThe only reason why I didnt give a five star is completely subjective.  Although I loved the over the top luxury, I felt like I was a guest in someone elses place.   And, because there was no station to really scrub myself squeaky clean, as I like to do in my favorite Korean spas back in L.A., I felt refreshed and wellpampered, but not quite cleansed.  Nevertheless, a wonderful experience not to be missed at the Encore."
1,"Let me start off by first stating, Ive been in the highend restaurant industry for  years as a waiter, trainer and General Manager. I managed Mangia, a Mediterranean restaurant on Madison Ave., in NYC.  Kabab has, without question, some of the BEST Lebanese and Mediterranean dishes Ive had, EVER! The dolmas  dolmades, falafel and babaghanoush where all amazing!  And to make our evening even better than the food... Our waiter, Heny hope I spelled that right.  He knows the menu like the pros do in highend establishments. Hes attentive, helpful and respectful to his guests needs.  There is no doubt well be spreading the news about this place and be back... soon!"
1,"I have been here twice now. I am still very pleased with the food. It is absolutely amazing. There is no other way to describe it. The only thing I have to say bad about this hidden gem, if you are a first timer, do not sit in the lounge  bar. The older female bartender  waitress paid very little attention to us and was not all to friendly. The food mire than made up for the service though. I recommend the Veal Tortellini. You cant go wrong with it."
1,"The kale salad is fantastic, especially the dressing! Lots of vegan and vegetarian offerings that are filling.  My only cautions are the raw desserts really arent that tasty and most of the entrees contain too much bell pepper.  However, the cowgirl cookies are a big favorite with my husband and son.  The special lemonades are also quite good if a bit pricey refills arent free so pace yourself.  This is one of the best vegetarian restaurants in the East Valley and the staff is very friendly  especially Matt!"
1,"Best Cirque show Ive seen, ever.  I love the Cirque shows and have seen several, this one cant travel due to the elaborate set so I strongly recommend seeing it if youre in town.  The music was awesome too.nnSat in the  level and saw very well but it would have been perfect to middle of  section at lower level.  Dont sit too close or youll be looking up and all around to take it all in.  Leaving the show after it ends is pretty slow so dont expect to get out of the theater until  minutes after the show.nnI thought some parts were pretty scary for kids under .  Just the costumes etc."
1,"Ive been here so many times before for brunch and I never fully enjoyed it to its extent but that all changed when when I went for dinner this past Monday night!nMaybe its because Ive always been drunk or super hungover so I cant ever really stomach buffet food but I was sober this time and it was soooo gooooooood!!nnMy boyfriends a Diamond status for Total Rewards so we got to skip the entire line  got seated right away which was definitely a PLUS because the line here is always SUPER long.. like  hours wait long.nnIn my opinion, buffets are ALWAYS better for dinner than brunch.  I dont want no scrambled eggs, bacon and sausage when Im at a buffet... I want the GOOD STUFF. and thats exactly what I got when I went nn for  people for dinner.n for  people for brunch on a weekend? that includes unlimited mimosas.nIf youre a Total Rewards member, use those points for a free meal! nnIn the mood for some Chinese? Sushi? Pho? Prime rib? Mexican? Seafood? This place has it all! nnI consumed a lot of seafood heresalmon, tuna,  red snapper nigiri, sushi rolls, fresh oysters, crab legs, clams  mussels.  The quality of seafood is always a hit or a miss at buffets in my opinion, but the quality here was well worth the money.  nOysters were very fresh with no fishy smelltaste, the crab legs had decent amount of meat to them  the nigiri was fresh as well.  nnI also finally got to try the juices that come in cute little bottles.   I tried the Guava, Mango  Horchata. Mango was really good and I also liked the Horchata but I found it a bit too sweet for my taste.nnNothing much to complain about here except I would stay away from the hot  sour soup and the prime rib as I found both of them to be extremely salty and unsatisfying.nnNOW FOR THE DESSERTS!nLovednChocolate covered strawberriesthe chocolate one was sweet  salty.  nCREME BRULEEsuch perfection.nItalian Cookie Gelato is probably the best flavor they offer.nMacarons are soft and sweet. Was not a big fan of the flavors they offer but they were still good.  I mean, what other buffet offers macarons at their dessert bar?!nnBASICALLY, if youre in Vegas, got time to kill  super starving. COME HERE.nTruly the best buffet in Vegas, hands down."
1,"Ah, a friday night and like many a working professional i found myself headed to the bar for a few drinks and a catch up with a lovely friend!  we decided on bon vivant and as i walked into the bar i was met with a scene of many suited men and some very attactive bartenders!!  perfect start to a friday night....nnnow if youre in need of a cocktail, the drinks list at Bon Vivant has a large number of options.  they also have a really good wine list from which i ordered a glass of riesling, an old favourite.  My friend opted for the Matinee cocktail which was a gorgeous concotion of rum mixed with kaffir lime leaves and some other items i cant remember nor can i find a cocktail list on their website to tell me...  i did have a taste of the cocktail and thought it was so good i ordered one as soon as i finished my wine!nnthe restaurant portion of this bar is lovely with a sort of gothic chic design.  the food menu is quite clever as all their starters come in two sizes, a start portion or a bite portion.  the bites are each ua and its a great way to try a few of the tasty starters they have on offer.  we ordered the crispy prawns, the breaded brie with pesto, the falafel with a chili and pumpkin sauce, and queenie scallops with garlic butter.  all of these were delicious and just the right size to enjoy as a nibble while having drinks.nnthe bites were also the perfect size to leave us with room to have a look at their dessert menu.  we shared a portion of the chocolate mousse with caramel and a quince and pear crumble with a side of pear ice cream.  both of these were absolutely delicious and were quickly polished off!!  the perfect end to our time at bon vivant and our catch up.  it was also good timing as the table was reserved, but i have to say that helpful staff never rushed us to leave which i thought was a nice touch.nnmy last comment about bon vivant is that the drinks may be a bit more expensive than other bars, but everything else on their menu is incredibly good value!  the bites at a ua are so good and the desserts were only ua for a size that was big enough to share.  its also worth noting that their desserts also come in a ua bite size.  and really, the cocktails are so good theyre totally worth the price!!  looking forward to another visit some time in the near future"
1,"LOVE THIS PLACE!!! I came on a Friday afternoon and got a table right away since it wasnt very busy. The service was quick and everyone was super friendly. I got the Lil Amadi with fries, and lemonade. Chicken was crispy and the WAFFLE was amazingly tasty. The menu made me giggle. Contemplated on coming back on my way to the airport but didnt have time ."

1,"When I came here for my first visit, last December, it was cold inside  they had run out of tamales, so it cost them a Star.  This time it was a bit warm inside, but with it  degrees outside, I was inclined to cut them a little slack.  Also, the food here is so special that you just cant hold them down to  Stars forever.  Really!     nnSo anyhow, this little madhouse was filled to capacity, at  PM this evening, but I got lucky  scored a table,  ordered a Taco de Asada steak, a Taco de Pescado breaded fish,  a Red Chile Beef Tamale.nnMy order arrived at the table in a short time despite the crowd,  was accompanied by both red  green salsa cups  a tray of grilled onions  green peppers to add on to everything.nnSo, how was the food?  OUT OF THIS WORLD GOOD!!  Yes, this very plain little place makes itself very special  Mr. Big Guy running the place found the time to give me a strong thank you for coming, just as he did last time.nnTaco de Asada  .nTaco de Pescado  .nTamale de Carne de Res  .nnI think this friendly, busy, noisy, plain little place with its inexpensively priced sensational food is ABSOLUTELY  STARS!!"
1,Love me some crown and anchor. nnThe last  times I have been in I get the chicken fingers and fries. These are some of the best chicken fingers around. Really good. nnThis also a good place to grab a drink and hang out with friends. If you are a soccer fan there almost always seems to be a game on. nnIf you like fish and chips Monday night is your night. Its all you can eat fish and chips. This are also very good. nnLast but not least Thursday night at this location is bad singer night. If you like to karoke than this is the place to be. If you like hearing your favorite song ruined also the place to be. nnI am a fan of crown and anchor.
1,"Yesterday afternoon, I started having a pretty good toothache.  By evening, I was in severe pain  nothing was helping.  Needless to say that I did not get any rest.  My dentist closes on Friday.  I called his cell phone for emergencies but was unable to reach him.  I started looking up area dentists, found the number and I called Boca Park Dental. I spoke with Amy who was very nice and understanding.  I was told to come in and they would try to work me in, despite their full load and my time restraints.  Before I had completed all of my paperwork, Dr. Turner saw me in the waiting room and whisked me back to numb my mouth after asking pertinent questions about the toothache and my medical history because I was shaking and crying.  I was in and out of here in under an hour!!!  Now, I am happy to say that I will become their regular patient, and not just for emergency use as I did today."
1,"Awesome!nnThis small bar is packed with tiki kitsch. nScreens play videos that range from traditional Polynesian dancers to s topless burlesque queens and Bmovie trailers.nnDrinks are strong, reasonably priced, and often quite interesting.nWhen I asked the bartender what the spicyherbal flavor was in my Zombie, I was told that it was their own bitters blend that included clove and ginger. Very nice!nnThere are several booths and larger tables for groups, but the bar is the place to sit."
1,"Is it bad that I loved the New York New York? After all, I am from the big apple. Neeew Yooooork, concrete jungle where dreams are made of theres nothing you cant do!nnI took a walk through on the way to the Roller Coaster. The casino was very fun themed and full of busy bright lights, a lot like the city I love. Even the guys handing out flyers, and discount books added the New York flavor to the hotel casino. There were pretzel shops, pizza shops, ice cream stores and a coyote ugly to definitely make you feel like youre in the heart of New York. nnI definitely wonder how it would be to stay at the hotel and constantly run into that type of traffic."
1,"Shayne was referred to us by a good friend and we used her for our personal and business taxes this year. She was really professional and very reasonable. We also are using her to help us with some IRS debt that we have. She is very friendly, knowledgeable and gets the job done fast. I highly recommend her."
1,"If youre familiar with PF Changs and their look, you probably wouldnt recognize this one in the SouthPark area.  To blend in any strict SouthPark codes, the restaurant looks like every other building in the area on the outside with just their name added.  Not until you get up to the front door hidden in a breezeway do you begin to recognize the establishment.  nnIve been to this PF Changs a few different times and had varied experiences.  The first few times were good, as expected.  Then I had the most crazy experience Ive ever had at a restaurant.  The hostess pulled a superiority card and said she couldnt seat our party of five for  minutes because there were no tables available to accommodate our size.  I pointed several out to her and she shrugged her shoulders.  Thats right  she shrugged her shoulders at me.  I guess nobody taught her how to count and spot empty tables before, so my logic blew her away.  I wrote a letter and got an immediate response from the GM who was very apologetic and invited us back.  We did give them another try and have been back a couple of times since.  nnOur return visits have been very good.  The food always tastes delicious and the service was excellent, too.  The chicken lettuce wraps are on the appetizer menu, but they make a fantastic meal for one.  I feel like Im eating so healthy  yet so tasty  when I choose them.   If Im really hungry, I go for the Ginger Chicken with Broccoli or Ground Chicken with Eggplant.  Its tough to decide between the two for me.  And usually its white rice for me as an accompaniment instead of their other option of brown rice.  I tried the Orange Peel Chicken once, not realizing how much orange peel they really put in the entree.  Ever eaten a lot of orange peel?  Its bitter.  And totally ruins the flavor of the meal.  And there isnt enough soy sauce in the world to correct it.  So what did I learn?  Orange Chicken good.  Orange PEEL Chicken bad.  nnOne of my favorite touches at PF Changs is that they offer a variety of sauces at the tables.  You can mix your own combination of oil, vinegar, hot mustard, soy sauce, and chili pepper sauce if you want to...or just go straight for the chili pepper sauce solo and let the heat take over.  YUM.  nnThe last time we were there, we splurged and got dessert, too?  Why?  They were tiny and calling our names.  For about , you can order a mini dessert about two spoonfuls in a shotglass just for a taste.  That way, you get the flavor without all the calories!  I tried  different ones  and, mind you, I LOVE chocolate  but the carrot cake one with cream cheese frosting was my favorite.nnp.s. I rated PF Changs not good for kids because they dont have kids menus."
1,"I really, really like this place a lot.nnThis is yet another restaurant where the surroundings and location dont necessarily say this place is excellent, but sometimes you have to jump in there.  Or, take the advice of a friend, which is how I found this place.nnThe dining room has always been quite clean, maybe made to feel moreso with the metal tables they look like polished aluminum or stainless steel, very modern looking, and there is some decent art hanging on the walls.  The restrooms are situated such that you can see into the kitchen area if you head over to them, which to me says that the owner has some pride in the cleanliness there as well.nnThe food can be slightly salty now and then, but only if youre really looking to taste the salt.  I wonder if this might be due to variations in the ingredients going into the dishes, but either way I never did run into a this is too salty situation.nnId love to point out one or two dishes that stood out, but I think they all did.  Several times did we grab shrimp, chicken, beef, curry, and soup dishes to dine in or take out, and it was always great.nnDefinitely worth checking out."
1,"Recently decided to skip town for a minivacation in Vegas. We found a good price online for Planet Hollywood so we went for it.nnPROSn Location is fantastic close walking distance to Bellagio, Aria, Cosmopolitan.n For whatever reason we got upgraded to a junior suite which was a nice surprise. The room was very well appointed, it had some memorabilia from Dr. Zhivago including a white dress that was displayed in a glass case. When we walked in the room it scared the crap out of us, because it looked like a ghost!. The bathroom was huge with his and hers sinks and separate showertub.nn The attached mall is good for killing some time. Grab a  Octane drink at Fat Tuesdays, go browse the shops, then go to Earl of Sandwich to get some food to lessen your buzz.n The casino was a lot of fun even for us nongamblersn Service was actually very friendly.nnCONSn The two pools were a major letdown. Theyre just too small and it just felt like we were too close to all the drunken fools that were hanging out there.n It seems the amount of smokers here was larger than the average Vegas casino. It really smelled like smoke in the hallwaysnnConsidering the price we paid hello, a junior suite for  on Sunday night!, we were very happy with the choice. BTW I didnt realize that fridges were a standard offering in Vegas Strip hotels. If you want a fridge stay at La Quinta"
1,"Great eats here. My wife had the gyro with a side of garlic fries and I had the seasoned chicken kebabs with the lemonoregano fries. Our tastebuds exploded. Period. The lamb in the gyro is so delectably tender and well seasoned that nothing even comes close...anywhere. Were from NYC and have had a good gyro here and there but this really kicks butt. Not to be outshined were the kebabs. Seasoned to perfection and moist! The portions and price are just right. Weve been here before but we continue to come back because of the consistency of service and food. nThe owner, by the way, is a rare guy indeed. In a world where the dollar is what motivates us all, this man has has a passion for his food and it shows.nnGive this place a try and you wont be sorry. There are some businesses Id like to see stick around and be successful and this is one of them."
1,"One of my favorite places for lunch. Cheap, fast, flavorful, and healthy  what more can you ask for? They are so fast that your food just may beat you to your table. Granted, the place is first come first serve for seating, but everyone who frequents there seem to know the code and will chow down their lunch and get out. So dont let the long line scare you."
1,"A cafe that definitely caters to more of an adultprofessional crowd. They sell sandwiches and salads options, as well as offer a few dessert items.nnI just came here for coffee and was pleasantly surprised by their options. My girlfriend ordered a White Coffee which was made with condensed milk. Definitely good for people who like creamy coffee drinks Theyre very flexible on how you want your drink ordered.nnI got an iced caramel drink that was about .. They put them in stryofoam cups which I thought was a bit weird especially for an iced drink. nnThe location is right off Rio Salado with metered parking or a garage. Its a bit hidden and not your typical ASU coffee shop where students are taking up all the spaces to study."
1,I was here while there was a rain storm going on the east coast and I was re routed to the Charlotte airport instead of Philly. I was impressed by the size and organization of this airport. All of the escalators and walkways were functional and restrooms were very clean. nnThey were very fast at moving air traffic as soon as the runway was cleared and we were able to take off about  minutes before the scheduled departure time after being delayed by  minutes. nnThere are plenty of options for shopping and dining. I did not have much time to explore everything but very impressed by the sheer size and architecture of it.
1,"Great setting, seating and atmosphere.  Yes its great to have a glass of beer, wine etc. and some nice touches like popcorn etc. nnBUT it is NOT a restaurant and yes, the food is mediocre at best and lets all agree, it is next to impossible to eat, let alone serve in the dark.nnMost times you go to a show and a movie so I suggest breaking it up and choosing one of the many great restaurants at the Quarter and enjoy the show with a beverage, great seats and have the best of all worlds!"
1,"This place is a winner in the Chelsea Premium Outlets in Downtown Vegas.  My girl got a Stella McCartney top for , that is like a  markdown...and it isnt ugly!  They are practically giving the shit away here.  I got some soccer stuff that were samples on the real cheap, you cant beat that.  My rule of thumb, shop in the hood for hood prices!"
1,"My family has been coming here for at least fifteen years. Not sure why I am just now writing a review, but better late than never! This little family owned and operated Italian place has always, and will always, be amazing. The service, the food, the atmosphere, everything about this place is as good as it gets. nnAt least one or more of the family members are working every night, and they take great pride in what they produce. There are family photos all around, as well as on the tables. The  boys all work in the restaurant when they are available or in town, and even if you dont get served by one of them, the service is always amazing. nnThey have specials every night which I love, because I am still able to try new things even though I have been coming here for years. My favorites are always their ravioli and their Giuseppes salad. Some of their menu items are named after each of the sons, which is a really nice gesture. nnThey also allow you to bring your own wine, and no corking fee! Such a great part, and it makes the bill a little lower than if you were to go elsewhere. nnWe will go to this place as long as it is around. We go here as soon as one of our friends comes into town for the first time, and they always request to go back when they come back into town. Even though we live in Cave Creek, we make the trip to this little restaurant. Great place for family, food, and a whole lotta love!"
1,"This review is for the Alvadora Spa at the Royal Palms Resort.  My friend planned an amazing weekend in Scottsdale and our day at this resort was relaxing and fun.  This Spanishstyle resort is quaint with a very European feel.nnI had a deep tissue massage, and it was among the best Ive ever had.  Even better is that with any treatment, you can enjoy the rest of the resort for the balance of the day.  Coming from the Chicago winter, we chose to lay by the pool, basking in the Arizona sun with a couple of cocktails.  Perfect way to spend a girls weekend away!"
1,"I think I just found our lodging for whenever we go to Vegas.  We had a junior suite with king bed booked for  nights.  Much to our surprise we were upgraded to a  bedroom suite.  It had a kitchenette with oven, microwave, stove, sink, and fridge.  Two full baths.  The master bath had a jacuzzi tub,  shower, separate toilet, two sinks, etc.  It was wonderful, and cozy.  There are  towers, but each is connected with a pathway that also leads to the casino."
1,Was craving a sub and saw all the Sicilian sub pictures on here so I decided to give it a try. nnSienas is a nice restaurant with a deli attached to the side. I was really surprised by the selection of food at the deli. There was also gelato and lots of cold foods but I played it safe and went with the Sicilian. Cashier was was very friendly and the service was fast. nnI would probably give this sub a . It was a delicious sub but Ive had better. The bread was really good and it wasnt messy like other subs that Ive had that are just prone to falling apart. nnI just really love that theres a freaking deli attached to this restaurant! I was expecting the sandwich to be pricey but it wasnt bad . including tax. This may be my new place to go when I get the munchies while studying at the Sahara library.
1,Cibo has not only great food but wonderful ambiance inside and out They serve clean and healthy food that is always tasty mmm pizza! It is located downtown in an old house thats been converted into the restaurant which gives it that old charm and private feel as you dine.n   Stop by for lunch or dinner and sit on the patio for a lovely dining experience sure to please any palate. Great for date night too
1,"I was never really introduced into the bagel world until I moved to the east coast. The cold, inclement weather would drive me home, whence i would enter the basement and peak into the pantry. Starving my ass off I would grab one of those bagels youd buy at one of those wholesale stores, in packs of . I would devour the vaguely fresh raisin bagel and immediately head off to mop floors or start an MIT problem set that would be due the next day. These were the kind of bagels that kept me alive while I succumbed to the masochism of the BostonCambridge college life. The bagels I would eat after a horrendously brutal crew workout. The poor bagels earned a dark, treacherous connotation, a symbol of my entrance into the brutal nature of adult life.nnFreshmen year ended, and flew off to Las Vegas, NV to begin a fellowship at UNLV. Couldnt ask for a better job great professors, new friends, cool dorm, and being surrounded by restaurants. However, waking up in the morning got no easier. Luckily, right across the street from campus, conveniently approached by a lighted crosswalk, lay Einstein Bros. The sish fresco art looked familiar. Wait a second, this was the same shit they sold at the Costco in Somerville, in those wholesale bags!nMy first real experience with a fresh, wholesome bagel came in the form of a cinnamon raisin with a strawberry shmear. I expected the same crappy shit my fraternity would buy during those torturously long house meetings. But when I took the first bite, I was like Oh my fucking god! I was immediately enveloped in culinary estasy. The cream chesse melted in my mouth the bagel was a heavenly assertion that I had met higher ends of life. nIt only got better. Honey almond wheat with an almond shmear. I wanted to freeze that point in time and live in happiness forever. Even better with the hazelnut coffee. nDo not forget to come here on your debaucherous resort getaway to sin city. Good stuff."
1,"This place is not your normal taco place, this place serves street tacos like youll find in LA and San Diego when youre wandering around.  Im a fan of this place obviously, and its super convenient located a quick walk from campus, and the free wifi is a bonus too.nnIm a fan of the chicken tacos, but really, all of the tacos are good, and I was even pleasantly surprised by the potato taco the first time I tried it.  The toppings are traditional, and definitely need to be spiced up for my taste, but lo and behold, there are like  different hot sauces to try.  You can ask the owner or cooks for suggestions, they know all the sauces they have.  Also, how can you not love a place that does a great taco Tuesday and have great beer prices?"
1,"It took me a very long time to find an Italian restaurant in the Phoenix area that I really enjoyed.  I had all the usual suspects in Scottsdale and Phoenix recommended to me, to varying degrees of success.  Most of them were good, but nothing that I would rather go to, than just make my own food at home.  A friend finally brought me to Marcellinos about  years ago, back when they were in North Phoenix I miss that little place.  nnSince the first day I went, Marcellino has been serving some of the best handmade pasta that I have ever had.  But my absolute favorite are his lamb chops and filet.  With so many favorites to choose from, its easier most days to just order the chefs tasting menu, which usually includes a duo of my some of my favorite appetizers scallops, or mushroom polenta, or some buffalo mozzarella and tomato, etc., a duo of pastas and a carne or a duo.  nnNot only is the food amazing, there is one server here in particular who always makes me feel like family, Scottie.  His knowledge of the menu, food, wine and the restaurant is flawless and his warm demeanor is incredibly welcoming.  His service takes this place a notch above the rest."
1,I have been to this location  times. All i can say is that  this place is somewhat inconsistent.  Tonight the bar area was a  for sure.   months ago it was a . So tonight for happy hour all bottled beer . and well drinks  bucks. Half off appetizers and an awesome bartender. Ordered the cheese crisp with machaca beef and a sampler.  All was hot to the table and super tasty.  Give this place a go if youre in the area!
1,"I give this place  stars cuz they cater to customers at anytime of the day and night.  After a hard night of drinking and clubbing, they will take your order for either breakfast, lunch or dinner at anytime.  You want to take it with you to your room, go ahead.nnMyself I had breakfast at  in the morning...it was good dont get me wrong.  Probably not the appropriate thing to be eatting after vomiting due to alcohol poisoning.  It was good though.nnSunnyside up eggs, hashbrowns, gourmet style...nnThe last day in Vegas we ate here.  i ordered Chicken fingers.  Now you would think  strips of chicken.  Lets try pieces with veggies and mashed potatoes.  No I didnt finsh it, I shared.  other dishes my friends tried was linguini with mussels funny picture for this dish of me and my friend sharing a string of linguine in a white wine sauce, flautas, and steak."
1,"Great for when youre really craving Thai food! nnI tried this place out recently when I had a really intense craving for Pad Thai at work. I did takeout since I was on my lunch break and waited about  minutes for my food, not bad. I was pretty impressed by the decor and ambiance of the place, it didnt have that grungy non updated look that most Asian restaurants have. It was pretty packed when I went and most of the customers there were people who worked in the business complexes behind or near the restaurant. nnI ordered the Pad Thai lunch special that comes with an egg roll and wonton. The egg roll was bland and forgettable, and the wonton was basically a deep fried piece of wrapper with a peasized piece of meat in it. However, the Pad Thai was very flavorful and had the right amount of spice and sweetness to it. nnI just found out there is another Archis location near my house, so I will definitely be trying their other dishes soon!"
1,"I was in Las Vegas for fun and decided I should get my eyebrows threaded.  I normally do not go because mine are pretty thin and I can keep them looking nice.  However, I had not done any upkeep and decided that I would just continue to let them grow until being in Vegas. nnI used yelp to find this place  was not disappointed.  It was very quick  was done well.  Something new for me was the use of rose water on my eyebrows after the threading was complete.  This was really soothing  felt very nice. nnI was able to checkin and use the Yelp coupon.  I thought pricing was reasonable and had a good experience here.  I would recommend it!"
1,"Ive never been out of the country, so Im a sucker for authentic places that can make me feel cool.  Pipers Pub makes me feel cool.  The waiter reminded me of Gerard Butler in accent, not appearance, sorry! and the menu was a friendly mix of American classics and Irish meals.  Me and my boyfriend both went for the Irish food. nMy Shepherds Pie was fantastic, topped by this flakey, beautiful carbthing that made the dish. Boyfriend said his bangers and mash was lackluster, but I tried it and I called him a liar.  Just needed salt. nI ordered a fancy sounding stout and was disappointed to reach the limits of my ability to blend into the Irish dining experience  it was much too bitter and dark for me.  I wasnt able to finish it, but Im still glad I tried it.nnWe went when it was pretty busy, and I wouldve loved to ask the waiter questions about the beer, but he was running around like a crazy man.  Oh well, I guess their job is to serve, not to entertain a beernovices questions."
1,This was the first meal we enjoyed when moving to Arizona and it really sealed the deal. The food was incredible. The best Mexican my party had ever had. I enjoyed the signature dish as recommendation of the waitress and was extremely pleased. The guac was out of this world. You couldnt be disappointed coming here. Must visit.
1,"P.F. Changs but fastcasual. The orange chicken is a stand by that we enjoy, we like to sub out the white rice for the fried rice. The wonton soup is great. Love the lettuce wraps.nnThis location can get very, very busy. The take out counter can get slammed and you have to help them find your order  sometimes the pickup time can be an hour after your order on busy weekend nights so plan ahead.nnDana Parks parking can also get very busy, Pei Wei has a nice amount of reserved parking for take out orders which is very convenient."
1,"My wife and I went to Fig Tree for our th year anniversary the food was superb as well as the service. We especially loved that it has a old house feel with plenty of charm. It s was highly recommended by friends, and we really enjoyed the  experience ."
1,"Combining a number of craft beers with halfoff Happy Hour, good food, an eclectic mix of patrons and occasional live music makes The Smiling Moose one of the better spots Ive visited on the South Side. I stopped by with the intention of eating, drinking and watching the Pens game and somehow found an empty seat at the bar. nnThats when I found out I only had  minutes left until the end of Happy Hour pm. Quickly looking over a salivating list of craft brews, I decided to partake in a Rogue Double Chocolate Stout. Of course, I made sure to order another one remember,  price! around  pm.nnThe bartender also informed me that all their sliders were half price during Happy Hour as well. One version included BBQ sauce, grilled onions, cheddar and bacon with a side of macaroni salad. I easily submitted an order. Thank you, Mr. Bartender! He eventually took away a completely empty plate as Smiling Ben enjoyed the rest of the game."
1,"Somehow my review got moved to the Yelp event page. Reposting here...nnEvery once in a while, you have an experience at a restaurant thats so lovely, you know youll remember it for years. The meal we ate at the Capital Grille this week doubtlessly falls into this category.nnI know that Capital Grille is a chain, and an expensive chain as well. Im not usually super excited about corporate steakhouses Ruths Chris meh, and I usually wouldnt have chosen one for a Restaurant Week outing. However, Capital Grille treated us so well during the Yelp Generous Pour event, we decided to return. Im glad we did the food and the service were both amazing.nnIll talk about the food first. Their Restaurant Week menu is not very varied they offer three steak entrees and one salmon dish. However, I dont see that as a downside, since if youre looking for something lighter andor vegetarian, youre not going to go to a steakhouse, anyways. For my entree, I ordered the Konaencrusted sirloin with shallot butter.. oh my. This was a good steak, folks tremendous flavor and perfectly cooked. Ive learned that this steak is on their regular menu as well. This could be bad for my credit card. The appetizer of clam chowder was good, if not exceptional. My dessert of creme brulee was delicious. Nevertheless, it was all overshadowed by that steak.nnOk, now lets talk about the service. Yes, my steak was amazing, but you can get an amazing steak at other venues. What really set this night apart was the level of service we received. Even though it was Restaurant week, and even though we had nibbled and sipped for free the weekend before, we were treated as well as they could have treated any bank executive or local politician. Our waiter, James, was unobtrusively attentive and poured us multiple glasses of wine on the house. The manager checked in on us and shook our hands on the way out. Ive never been treated better in a restaurant, especially when eating a meal at such a considerable discount.nnIn case you cant tell from the above, we really had a fantastic evening. I suspect that well be back the next time we have an excuse to splurge."
1,"Thanks to Yelp, we found this gem of a breakfast spot.  l had the Fancy Pants scramble with spinach, onion, garlic, turkey, brie, and fig compote and it was decadently delicious. My daughter had the breakfast burrito and the menu allows you to pick what you want inside which is great for youngsters. Other daughter had silver dollar pancakes and rediscovered her love of bacon at the same time. Will be back for sure."
1,"awesome food.none of a good dining experience with excellent service.nthe food is a tad salty for my taste, I wish they use more natural ingredient other than Salt.npresentation was great and cooked my filet to perfection. the meat on the other hand, had a few gristle.  that seems awful..nI would try a different meat dishes, but they should monitor their steak quality.."
1,Had the country fried steak again.  Of course it was good.  Meat was tender and flavorful.  The only thing I didnt like the the coffee....It tasted really burnt.  I guess theyre really going to that diner taste!
1,"This place pleasantly surprised me Im always looking forward to trying new breakfast joints. This place serves up a very Traditional Americana Breakfast! Dont look for anything fancy because you will not find it, they dont offer much but what they do offer  is mostly good. For pete sakes order their namesake! Ordering tip, make sure you stick with the meals they have prepicked on the menu because if you try to alacarte your meal its going to cost you a small fortune. I like the barn yard feel, especially considering this place use to be a carwash so they did an awesome job on the conversion. The only thing I would suggest is a better grade of coffee, I like a really smooth velvety taste, this one has a more gas station scorched taste. Best bacon and biscuits on this side of town!"
1,"Excellent food and well worth the drive. I had the enchiladas suizas for a main course and absolutely loved them. Guacamole is tasty, with pomegranate mixed in to the avocado mix. Service is very good, too."
1,"I would come back here everyday if I could.   Too bad I live across the country, can you open one in Boston?  This is a perfect spot for dog owners, which I am.  nnSo much beer, so much great food, so many wonderful dogs!   I met some friends here while on a business trip and I had no idea what a gem this was from the front.  As soon as you walk in, theres this great outdoor patio, great inside area and as you continue to the back patio, it opens up to a whole new world!nnThe beer was fantastic.  Craft brewed, and I ordered a small pitcher of amber on my own.  I got a burger and fries and it was juicy, tasty and went perfectly with the beer.  One of my friends ordered fish tacos and I had the pleasure of taking a bite.   Yep, Ill be getting those next time.nnFantastic place and I will come back any chance I get!"
1,Ate here after arriving at the Mirage after a long flight.   We were tired but wanted something to eat.   Walked around the Strip for a bit and came back here. Had a hot pastrami sandwich and fries DELICIOUS!  You can also get food to take out.
1,"A true, authentic dive in the most accurate sense of the word. Theres neither pretense nor irony, either. This place has cheapish beer, decent shots, a great jukebox and patrons with good enough taste to make the right decisions when pumping money into it.nnIts small and Im pretty sure its not air conditioned. However, this is a great downtoearth place to while away some spare time. Nice people. As others have said, Dons a great bartender too.nnCash only, natch."
1,"I have been going to  for about  months and cant say enough about this gym. The Coaches are great, they work with you, and they help you. They put together great classes and are always challenging us. The members of  are great people. We all check our Ego at the door and encourage each other throughout the process. Keep up the good work  staff!"

This video was shot  couple of months ago. or go on YouTube and type Full Delicious Bellagio buffet tour and you will see my videonnhttpswww.youtube.comwatch?vaeixPhmCInnI had an opportunity of dining at Bellagio buffet for the second time. We ate for dinner during the holidays rush, so we had to pay close to  per person.nn This time was actually pretty good and had a lot of varieties of food to choose from. nnI have never had beef wellington before, Ive only heard and seen it on Hell Kitchen, but man it was moist and good. nnThey even had Pho. It was blend, but eatable. nnThey even had Alaskan King Crab Legs, which is the most expensive crab legs out there. I spent most of my time, eating the King Crab legs and not the Snow crab legs since you can find snow crab legs for dinner at every buffet in Vegas.nnI didnt get any sushi, but man, the lines were looong to get some made to order sushi roll.nnDeserts were abundant. They even have Macarons. I saw one diner got a whole plateful of Macarons, Im assuming they going to stuff that into their purse to take home.nnService was good. Server kept clearing the plates quick.nnOverall, it was a pretty good dining experience.nnLike I said before, if you guys want to see what kind of food are served at Bellagio, check out my video below or go onto YouTube and type Bellagio Buffet and you are likely to see my video on top of the playlist.nnhttpswww.youtube.comwatch?vaeixPhmCI"
1,"Fry Bread is really a lot like fried dough, but this restaurant takes it to a whole new level. My favorite is the beef and vegetable stew, but they have tacos and dessert stuff too. All centered around fry bread of course. The service is quick and the prices are reasonable. There is not wait staff. You order and they call your name.The night that I went most recently was a busy night because of a fair that was happening on th ave, so the food took about  minutes, but usually its pretty prompt."
1,"Great Food, Fantastic Atmosphere, Future BoundnThis place has it all, inviting ambiance, friendly staff and a creative menu.  Ill start off with the food since thats the heartbeat of all restaurants.  My personal favorite is the Captains Burger, a juicy slider they call them mini burgers seasoned to perfection with balsamic reduction, feta cheese, arugala, tomatos, and carmelized onions.  Im getting the craving just typing about it.  This is set off by a delicious wheat bun....mmmmm!  The Pep Pep and the Buffalo Soldier are good as well, but its hard to pass up my fav.  Also try the Sweet Potato fries, a unique and tasty twist to typical fast food.  The atmosphere is fun and filled with energy, music is pumping, colors are vibrant and the staff is courteous.  Its a haul for me so I usually catch them at First Friday in their Food Truck"
1,"Giovannis is the sort of business that demands I stop what Im doing and write a glowing  albeit limited  review. Im ashamed at having waited this long to do so. nnMy GF and I were in town for the New England debacle around Halloween and stayed at a nearby hotel. A quick Yelp check revealed that Giovannis was THE place for pizza in the area. So we ordered. Then we ordered again. nnAfter that, we order some more.nnI cant rave enough about how large, delicious and filling their Texas Roadhouse Steak hoagies are.  minutes after calling in, my order arrived. I swear I heard carols of angels singing as I unwrapped the paper. Inside were steak, onion rings, provolone cheese, fried onions, peppers and mushrooms lathered in a spicy Santa Fe sauce. nnThe memory stimulates my salivary glands as I type.nnNeed I go on?nnBut dont stop reading now. Because the pizzas are also large and tasty Freshly baked bread, excellent sauces and a wonderful assortment of meat toppings. nnCorporate pizzeria conglomerates Are you taking notes?nnBecause if the owners ever think to expand, Giovannis will...well, eat your lunch."
1,"This place is a secret little slice of food heaven. Everything they make ia amazing. My love is for the Shrimp Arepa, then pork, then beef. My  stars should speak for themselves. So happy to see them grow from a tiny shack, across from the titty bar, to a legit building took over the asian bbq on the corner, in the old tower records shoppibg centerThey need a food truck. Hear me, Arepas? FOOD TRUCK!"
1,"WTF, I just notice I never review this place before.  Well, let me get started then!nnThis is one of must stop place in Vegas for me, and t should be yours too!nn things that I always order herenn. Tom Yum Ka  a little bite of sourness with a little bit of heat a perfect balance of what a soup should be.  The chicken and mushroom inside also complements each other perfectly. Its a light soup, not heavy at all, so perfect for any day.nn. Garlic Shrimp  cannot not find it any other Thai restaurants Ive been to. Its basically fried shrimp with their secret seasoning. The shells are also fried until their extremely crispy, so you can actually eat it!  You MUST try this!nnrd item always depends on my mood.  This time, its chripy duck with drunken noodle. If you ever had pad see you, it tastes like that with lots of basil. The fried duck is crispy and moist, yummmoooo.nnIf you never had good Thai food before, this is the place to come. Oh, becareful the level of heat you asks for. If you can take spice, then theres nothing you need to worry about, but if you can, go  or lower!"
1,"Ive read the reviews, heard the recommendations, and finally I was in the area today so I got to try Grumman . So glad I did.nnThe tacos were flavourful and, while small, the staffs recommendation of  tacos for a meal was right on. I had the Pork Banh Mi, the Jerk Chicken, and the Beef taco and was quite pleased. I wasnt even offended by the price as some of you mentioned given that the ingredients seemed fresh, tasted great, and they werent skimpy on em. I didnt buy the  taco though. I cant conceive of a taco that size that would be worth  to me.nnAnd the drinks out of a bag. Creative. Never seen that before well, maybe those juice bags we had as a kid but certainly never at a restaurant.nnGood job, ! Ill be back."
1,This place is seriously so AWESOME...this is my husband and my go to for late night eats...all the BOMB appetizers are  off and super yummy..the staff is the best part too always so friendly and nice and hold good conversation...this place has been a fav of mine since I was young just good ol bar food...not to mention my elderly grandparents come here almost daily just for their yummy soup! Thank you for being so awesome!
1,"I am finally going to write a coherent review that does not labor with ramblings before the actual review. One that succinctly gets to the point and does not meander through the muddy waters of trying to come up with an anecdote that gets the point across without actually delving into a review of the actual place. Oh damn, Ive done it again. Here goes...nnWhat can I say Mr. Thomas, not sure if that is his real name, you do a very good job.  I have taken numerous shirts and trousers to him and he makes sure that they fit according to my specifications. Examples Shirt sleeves shortened and darts added so that it fits closer to the body. Trousers hemmed, tapered, and the seat taken in so it is not baggy.  It can be expensive, depending on what kind of work you are getting done, but the workmanship is excellent. I would definitely recommend this tailor."
1,"Good but not great. They definitely have an inventive menu that is the main appeal to me. Corn Flake Eel Croquettes??!! Tried it and it was different but good!  Staff was very nice but service was spotty. I had the lobster Spaghetti which was very good but served lukewarm. Also, the boys ordered the ribeye for two which they couldnt finish, but liked it. Overall a really noisy spot best enjoyed with friends where you need to shout to be heard which I thought distracted from the overall experience. I wont be a regular, but would go back if asked."
1,"Had a great time at Tryst. Escorted to our table with no wait in line. we made reservations a few days before recommended. nnSingle bottle service was perfect for the four of us. The music was surprisingly good ... Remixes of  min of pop  hiphop songs. nnGreat vibe. Would definitely go back on my next trip. In fact, Im staying at the Wynn on my next trip without a doubt."
1,"Ive been working with Jason for about  years.  He is an outstanding person, honest, kind, hardworking and ethical.  nnI recommend my clients to Jason because, I know that he will do everything, legally, within his power to get my clients loans done.  He has been able to get loans done for clients that I thought might not even be possible.  He has superior timing with staying in touch with buyers and cooperating real estate agents.  He gets documents to title well ahead of the game.  He is friendly and always has a positive attitude.  He just makes the entire process so much less stressful than it is with other loan officers.nnI know when my clients go to sign their final papers there will be not last minute surprises when Jason does their loans. He has already gone over the process and what their loan will entail in detail with them.  They always have great praise for Jason. nnJason is in the Top  Mortgage Originators in America for  not because, he takes any deal and slams it through. Its because, he is exceptional at what he does and people go back to him again and again and also send their friends and families.nnYou wont be disappointed when you use Jason.  I doubt you would ever think of using another loan officer again!"
1,"My fiancuee lives nearby so we decided to try this place out.  I ordered the cheeseburger and she had the fried zucchini and gyro.  We both had fries as well.  The service was real good although we were only one of two couples in at the time.  The food was pretty good. A little bit pricey, but the food was pretty good overall."
1,"This was the first time I got Greek food, and since I got there the service was great, they explained me everything and Nick the owner was there talking with every customer in the restaurant... Very friendly environment, great food, and I will defenetely recomend this place to my family and friends!!!"
1,"Who would think of seeing this kind of store in the South? This shop is a mustsee. It has a wide variety of unique and interesting products such as magnets I bought a ton for myself and my family and books about Asian gardening techniques. They basically have something for every type of person, literally. nnIts really the kind of store you would find in Brooklyn or in alternativehipster areas of major cities, and as much as I am not a hipster, I just could not resist this places charm.nnMore power to you Paper Skyscraper!"
1,"This is a great barber shop. The guys here are consistent and know what theyre doing, Ive been going here since  and every time I walk in, Im confident that Ill walk out with a good haircut.nnPlus, you can usually walk in on some interesting stories from back in the day and learn something new!"
1,"Goodness, could there be anything more delicious...I could not decide what I wanted more to start with dessert just in case I got full or have a normal meal progression. In the end I started with dessert which was fantabulous!! The Nutella Banana!!! This is a light melt in your mouth crepe."
1,"Lets get to good stuff right awaynnNutella Milkshake  absolutely delicious.nnBuilt my own Kobe Burger w Bacon, Avocado, and Chipotle Sauce on the side.nn Regular fries and Sweet Poato fries were not good. I wish they were better, because it would have made the entire meal perfect.nn Service was standard and the wait time for  people on a Saturday afternoon approx  minutes."
1,"I really like Wallys. Ive tried several options there.nMy favorite is the Chop Chop Salad its a nice combination of vegetables and I like the honey mustard dressing that its tossed with. They dont put too much dressing so its not soggy, but its nicely coated.nnI also like the Veggie Burger Its a housemade patty which I always appreciate.nnTheir Basil Hummus appetizer is also very nice.nnMy husband and father both rave about their Fish and Chips Fried but never too greasy, and nice pieces of fish. nnWallys is definitely upscale pub food and a nice atmosphere. The wait staff is always kind and the restaurant is always clean!"
1,"WOW... pure fun and great music! its a nice is of ages being  I did not feel like the old man in the place.nnwould have give  starts but drinks could be a little less expensive, and get rid of the smoking."
1,"I am not a great poker player.  In fact, Im not even a GOOD poker player.  I would love to engage in the illusion that I am a great poker player.  The reason the MGM Grand Poker Room gets many stars from me is because it creates a temporary reality where I actually get to feel like Im a relatively GREAT poker player.  nnDont get me wrong.  I got absolutely owned one night here to the tune of  on a single hand because I badly misread an opponent.  However, aside from that one rather unforgivable mistake, I was playing the lowest limit poker offered  and pretty much was able to pay for everything but my room while I was in Vegas purely with my poker winnings.  And that was after sitting at their tables for no more than  hours TOTAL during a three day period.  nnIf you arent any good like me but would still like to make a decent sum of money apx hr, I would strongly suggest playing a relatively tight game early on and getting it all in when you know you have the goods.  Some people here will call you just to see what you have even if they have essentially nothing.  Seriously.  But aside from the rare miracles, a relatively basic understanding of pot odds and statistics should earn you a relatively healthy sum of money.  nnHow is the actual poker room?  The dealers are friendly, the cocktail waitresses bring your non alcoholic drinks of choice at a relatively quick rate, and there was quite a bit of nonasinine table talk.  Because the MGM Poker Room is in a temporary location right now, I didnt notice the loud blaring music that others have noted.  Then again, I played exclusively morningafternoon sessions here.  So there might be your answer.  This definitely is not the sexiest poker room.  If you are looking for that type of experience, you should go to Aria.  If you arent at least a semidecent player, however, prepare to lose hundreds if not thousands of dollars.  nnOverall, I think this is a fine poker room for people who just want to play lowlimit tables against people of modest poker ability.  If you are looking for a more challenging game or if you just want to play somewhere that looks gorgeous, go elsewhere."
1,"Crazy. Awesome. Good. I cannot believe it took me this long to try some Short Leash Dogs!!nnThe truck is adorable and the service is top notch. I dont have to repeat things  times and the service is much quicker than I expected.nnI ordered the Lady dog which has onions, fried pickles and chipotle cream cheese sauce. I got it on an all beef dog. I added mushrooms to it for something extra.  When I got it, it was piping hot in bread that I think is naan, and if not, is something pretty damn close. It was so good, I didnt want it to end. I didnt want to admit that I had an empty dish in front of me. I wanted to get in line and buy another. But it was enough for a complete meal and I knew I had no one to roll me into my house even if I managed to make it to my car.nnIt was piping hot, which was good but that combined with the bread made it a little hard to hold. Im not complaining though. Next time Ill just have to knife and fork it, which is completely fine by me. nnAdditionally they have pepsi in a bottle, which is hard core. Im a fan!"
1,"Ive been to Cibo a handful of times and each time I have left full, content and served well. It can be crowed if you are eating at peak times days, but that just reiterates the tasty food and pleasant service! nnIf you have not been, I hope you enjoy Cibo as much as my wife and I do."
1,Went and saw Nathans show again at his new theatre.  The theatre at the Miracle Mile Mall matches with Nathans show  both class acts.  Still have the great prices and the new theatre is much more comfortable than the old. Again I went with the VIP seating and again I was amazed at a great show with a great value.  You never know who his surprise guest might be.  I just read he is adding some new illusions so looks like another trip to Vegas will be in my near future.  Love your show Nathan  wishing you continued success!!
1,"Excellent restaurant located right off main lobby of Caesars.  More casual relaxed atmosphere but still very tastefully designed and decorated restaurant. Food and service was outstanding.  Three of us diner for dinner.  Appetizers were deviled eggs spinach dip and Mac and cheese. All were awesome tasty and nicely presented.  The meatloaf , spaghetti and meatballs and filtet mignon were superb nnWe shared a huge banana split with their homemade Ice cream and cheesecake for desert. Both were bog portions and delicious nnWe met manager Raymond and our server was Jody. Both were gracious and welcoming and service was spot on!  nnI highly recommend Central.  It is an unpretentious dining experience with a twist on Americas comfort foods.  Open  hrs too"
1,I was searching for a good nails place in the area for Xmas gift certificates for my co workers and found this salon with a lot of great reviews. The manager great me very kind and my coworkers come back after try them out with a very high recommend. I will come back to joint them again. They are great staffs.
1,"Seeing the Dale Chihuly glass art and paintings on exhibit and for sale at this gallery located in the new City Center was one of the highlights of our recent trip to Las Vegas.  A gallery agent named Mary was particularly helpful and knowledgable about the exhibit.  Items displayed included glass chandeliers, sculptures, bowls and columns as well as drawings and something we had not seen in Chihuly exhibits before, an acrylic on plexiglas that was lit from behind for a remarkable impact.   Weve seen larger collections of Chihulys work and installations in more amazing settings, as in the Desert Botanical Garden in AZ a couple of years ago and, of course, the ceiliing of the Bellagio lobby. But the display here seemed unique for how up close one could get to the art.  nnNow if we could only afford to buy one of the talented Mr.Chihulys creations!  Hmmm..we wonder how those blackjack tables work???"
1,Yummmmmmmm soooo good. Got their combo pan roast with a friend   on the spicy level. It was super yummy and really filling... so I definitely recommend sharing. There really is very little seating only seating is around the bar surrounding the kitchen. The lady waiting on us was really nice and super helpful.
1,"I love this place!  They have a good selection of frames incl. some very unique ones.  I especially like Linda who has fitted me several times and has an INCREDIBLE eye for what looks good on you, your face shape, your personalitytype.  Dr. Albert is great too and provides very thorough exams.  Highly recommend.  BTW, they are also very accommodating and will fix or redo any prescription or frame if it doesnt work out."
1,"Let me start off by saying that I had a wonderful meal with my family at Gordon Ramsays Steakhouse.nnWe had a reservation for pm, and the hostess seated us right on time when the doors opened. We were then greeted by our waiter Matthew who showed us the ropes and was extremely pleasant and knowledgeable. Also serving us was a very nice man named Mohamadu who did not skip a beat when it came to refilling glasses and removing finished dishes both he and Matthew had a great sense of humor and really made our party feel welcome and relaxed.nnTo aid us in our drink selection the restaurant uses an Ipad with an interactive drink menu which really came in handy, giving us all a look at what each cocktail would look like when served. I was surprised with the ease of use of the device and everyone played with it a bit before ordering. We ordered a nice cabernet sauvignon, with the aid of the delightfully helpful and knowledgeable sommelier, and the HK antioxidant cocktail both were fantastic. Then, to aid us in our choice of steak for those who wanted steak, the staff brought out a wonderful arrangement of cuts and Matthew gave us a quick but detailed description of each. This was fantastic, being able to see each cut and knowing exactly what you were going to get as you ordered!nnAfter placing our orders, a delicious assortment of specialty breads was served. Mohamadu noticed that we had all sampled the same kind of bread, and without a moments noticed had returned with an extra plate of just those breads we all very much appreciated his keen attention to detail as we devoured them.nnThe food arrived hot and prepared as ordered... to perfection. Every dish our group of  enjoyed was delectable and exceeded all expectations. Each of us ordered something different, so we sampled a good portion of the menu to include several different entrees, sides, and soupsalads. Especially delicious was the beef wellington, which is one of the steakhouses specialties. Also I would like to point out how great the macncheese was  I would have never though macaroni could taste this good! After dinner we enjoyed a few of the desserts offered to include the cheese platter, and again we were not disappointed.nnAs we all walked out, Matthew and Mohamadu shook our hands and thanked us as we passed by. We have all dined at several other highend restaurants in Las Vegas and never once had service like this. Many other dining spots in the area have exceptional food, but none have the atmosphere and care you feel like a guest in someones home.nnSo to sum it all up, my party and I thoroughly enjoyed the atmosphere, service, food and drinks ordered. Each dish was cooked to order and all were seasoned deliciously. The service was second to none, and if you want a sure bet for wonderful service I would definitely recommend asking for Matthew and Mohamadu by name... they wont disappoint!"
1,the quality of and consistency of the food at the location is on par with other locations weve dined at.  my favorite location is still the anaheim location for its decor and service. overall a good dining experience.
1,"Great food! The atmosphere is awesome!nMe and my gf had the lobster,crab,artichoke dip and it was on point! We also like the classic sliders! Cook medium rare so theyre juicy.! And of course u cant forget about the variety of beers they have on craft! I recommend it if ur down in Glendale area! West gate is a great little oasis of entertainment here In the canyon state!"
1,"Was a little pricey for my wife and I and  yr old... .. I had a filet mignon, lobster tail combo... tail was  small, and I thought if my filet was good, it would be no big deal. Instead, I had  different bites of my filet also small that were very grisly. They did remake me a new filet  which brought them back to a , although my wifes full size filet was very dry. They did offer to take both off the bill, so kudos for that although we told them to leave it on the bill since we both ended up getting our fill. Dessert and appetizers were very good, but  for two drinks each was a bit much."
1,"Great place to eatnI was told to check if out by a friend of mine nAnd great surprisenGreat vibe great food nNot expensive and authentic tastenI also had the pleasure for take away nWould always recommend and sometimes live music too ,,,ask"
1,"Very enjoyable.nn I had the SD chop salad which I thought was quite good, my companions got the fish tostadas and cobb salad and they both enjoyed their meals as well.nnThe high point of the lunch was that we ordered the nachos as a starter, they were excellent. nnService was good, decor is nice, allinall a place to which Ill definitely return."
1,"OK, so check this out.  I know I have been long dormant with the Yelp reviews bad girl, BAD GIRL!, so to make it up to yall, I am now embarking on a casinobycasino tour of my new hometown of LV, NV, and will include reviews of each as I tour them.  Now, these will not include room stays, but just schlepping around the premises  eating, drinking, and checking out anything that moves or doesnt move.  Got it? OK, lets proceed...nnReview nthis place is huge! the story about getting lost in the casino rings true here I actually got locked out of the place during my exploring, but luckily an employee rescued me and let me into the adjacent convention center which is quite grand as well there is a walkway to the  Signature Towers of highend condos the outdoorpool areas are extensive  top notch love the massive hotel lobby with the classic MGM lion sculpture many scenic high end eateries, including  Joel Robuchon restaurants the West End bar is kind of dark  sexy and tucked away, but not always open armies of hotties headed to Hakkasan nightclub  wowza! best craft beer bet  Michael Minas Pub  for sure, but you will pay to play! Tap Sports Bar also has a few, but prices arent much better there"
1,Not my favorite brewery in town but it was a pleasant experience. The beer selection is very good and the brews go down smoothly. Food was decent. Better than traditional bar food but far from great. Huge place could definitely accommodate a big party. Also a very nice patio.
1,"First and for most I pride myself on knowing good spray tans since Im obsessed with them... I came across Platinum spray tan awhile back and have been in LOVE with the products, service and MJ. nMJ helps the customer feel special... she dives in to really get to know what youre looking for as a customer. She develops special blends to get you that perfect shade of tan. We have mastered a lot of shades but its always fun when MJ says she has a new formula to try... Im  in for new shades to try out. nI have used The Platinum spray tan service many times... However, MJ is kind enough to do Platinum spray parties  when my girlfriends and I have big events we call MJ to come over and do a spray party  Its awesome because she has it all... from light medium to the darkest dark, MJ will find you a color that you love!nI truly love Platinum spray tan and everything that it represents price, formula, hospitality and service.... I hope you enjoy it like I will continue to do so."
1,"We were outoftown visitors wandering around Mill St. late morning.  We probably would not have found Dog Town had we not decided to check out the big Christmas tree erected across from their store. The store is tucked away at the back of the building, not visible from Mill St. A sign in front of the store indicated they serve breakfast. We both had a breakfast burrito and agreed that it was very good, although one of us found it a little salty.  The burritos contained ample portion of scrambled egg with bacon bits and seasonings on a big flour taco. A tasty salsa was available. Hit the spot for us."
1,"There are certain stops and things one must do in the quintessential Las Vegas experience.  One of these is visiting a Buffet. Grand, new, welladvertised, we ventured into the Bacchanal Buffet. True to its name sake, this was a site to behold. Grandiose duecor, hundreds of selections, and a massive seating area, this certainly fits the Las Vegas over the top bill. nnI never thought Id find myself reviewing a Buffet, but yet, here I sit. Compared to say Aria, and at double the price, I expected a certain higher quality than Aria. I didnt find it. Seafood selections are nearly identical, and while Bacchanal does offer warmed snow crab at particular times, it is still the same snow crab, shrimp, and green lip mussels you find at most buffets. Salads, charcuterie, and pizza also stand out as common to all buffets. Now to the standout, to what makes this stand out as a step up. This, stands in the carving and dessert sections. Fine selections of wellprepared meats, such as prime rib, ham, artisanal sausage stand out from most nicely. The desserts well prepared, and well executed, except the crueme brulee are quite pleasing, and complemented with an interesting selection of gelato Blood Orange and Pistachio being my weapons of choice.  nnHaving said all that, for the price point, Id rather visit Aria, or a proper restaurant, but if youre going to do only one Buffet in Las Vegas, and dont mind splurging a bit for the one, go ahead, and give it a whirl."
1,I love robertos. when it comes to fast Mexican food they do it best. The university location never disappoints except if theres more than a few people in line. It seems to take extraordinarily long to receive your order. But its always hot and delicious. Staff is polite  helpful
1,"If youre looking for a novel place to hangout and youre in need of some entertainment and drinks, then. this could be the place for you and some friends.nnWhen you first arrive, the hostesses may look like theyre having a bad day or just annoyed that youre there please know that its all part of what makes Dicks Last Resort what it is, they set the tone for your dining experience.nnThe staff will shock you with their rude behavior, cut downs, and snide remarks making the experience for hanging enjoyable and fun.nnOur waiter was quick to give a ghetto large sheet of paper as tablecloth and get our drink order.nnThe menu is basic and simple and feature large drinking vessels that you can take with you when you leave.nnDont expect the food to be a culinary phenom, its pretty basic BBQ type of menu but nothing really spectacular, which, in this restaurant, I feel is ok. Its more about the experience and comedy that draws its crowd.nnAs my group sat and found ourselves laughing at our waiters rude and playful remarks, I did notice a family dining next to us with kids. Just a note to any future families with kids who enter this restaurant, please know that the restaurant may not be the best choice to bring your little kids, unless youre a progressive family and dont mind foul language, cursing, or sex jokes. nnIf I had to give it a movie rating, it would, rated PG nnTowards the latter part of our eating experience, the waiter places a ghetto made hat with a colorful and rude quote on it check out the pics included with this review giving it that final crazy touch that made this restaurant fun!nnIf youre in Las Vegas at The Excalibur, I would definitely recommend having friends get together for happy hour and kick start your evening here for some great drinks and fun rude atmosphere!"
1,"Anthony is very sweet. My MK watch crystal had been replaced at that horrid quick fix in the galleria they replaced my screen which had a tiny scratch after two years of use and the one they replaced it with shattered in a week high quality  worth? I think not! and needed repair once again. I took it to Anthony.  repair plus a consult in which is asked me why there was a bubble crystal on my watch that clearly needed a flat one thanks again galleria mall watch store! Ugh.  Anyways, very honest man who got me the flat crystal I needed and had my watch fixed in a few hoursI found his shop here on Yelp and so happy I did! Will go to him for any repairs."
1,"Ive had two treatments so far. The service is great. Always on time, they call a few days before to remind about the treatment.nProfessional, friendly, detailed.nHavent seen any roaches since they started spraying.nnnThe last service I used not going to mention the companies name was so annoying. The tech would stand around and talk for an hour. I always dreaded the service."
1,"First time I ate here it was during the Grand Opening and the food was a bit cold.  I have since have eaten here several times and it looks as if they have got all of the kinks out.  The selection is amazing and the service is outstanding.  As a Diamond member in the TR program I get to skip the long line which is fantastic!!!  Love the buffet and I love Ceasars Palace.  The managers for the restaurant are always on the floor talking to the guest and I love this,  it really shows they care about the place."
1,Best pizza Ive ever tasted! I have had it once a week since I discovered it! A bit pricey at that rate but worth it. I get the pesto instead of read sauce w mozzarella and basil. Love the thin crust and woodfire taste. Just YUM!
1,"This is a fairly new location for Einstein but, I am surprised it wasnt on YELP!, yet.nnAnyway, being new, the decor is very fresh.  The interior design is quite nice, large, open, spacious, tons of seating, and a GREAT location.  The strip mall it is located in is pretty cool, with other neat stores.  So, its a great place to grab a bkfst or lunch bagel if visiting Lake Mendota, or shopping in the area.nnFree wifi is always nice, too.nnI had a breakfast bagel sandwich, on pumpernickel...and it was quite good.  Im not sure how they whipcook their eggs but, there is something different about them.  Odd.  Not unpleasant, I do like them, just, the texture is different.  Had  a latte, and that was well made.  Not some generic machine like you see at a lot of other places.nnhint  if you do Google street view, it shows the old Mexican taco place that used to be there..this is A LOT better!  However, Google maps does correctly list the business address and location as Einstein"
1,Okay....this hotel is by far amazing..... upon check in since we were celebrating a th birthday we got an AMAZING UPGRADE to a huge suite!!!  So that was awesome!!!!!..... nnDownside.... Later that night I notice they had drafted out a . charge on my debit card that was not disclosed upfront for any charges on the room!!!!! I was very unhappy about it..... it wasnt pending it was TAKEN straight out of my funds..... nnThe Marquee Day Club........it is a cool scene however . tab to rent a lawn chair...PASS!!!!!!!  And while we were getting a drink at the bar my GF laid her phone on the bar and while she was turned away the bartender chick totally stole her IPHONE....No one else was even around so we know it was her....... The hotel security would not do anything because they said they are not affiliated with THE MARQUEE DAYCLUB....So keep an eye out.... they are shady folks working out there!!! nnBond was super cool place to hang out and watch the girls in the boxes put on little shows!  nnRoom services .... .....but pretty good.... but not amazing.... nnOverall....Very glam place.... just very expensive as well but if you have  to blow then its your type of enviornment!!!
1,"Every Vegas buffet has a dude slicing prime rib. So, Ill use that as the first metric I got three slices of prime rib at the Wynn, it was soft, juicy, red rare, and cut almost  inch thick. And the butt end was wellherbed and just a touch crispy. Damn fine stuff.nnWe spend over two hours here, sampling the whole array except crab legs  Im allergic. Another staple, the shrimp cocktail, was jumbo and succulent and lacking that awful freezer burn that poorer buffets have. Other fish, including the sea bass and the three of four ceviche samplers, were all well above average. The clams with red sauce were a little better than average, but hey  clams! The buffet sushi experiment was less successful. My instinct stay away from buffet sushi stands uncorrected.nnThe gorging potential was fantastic. Sticking to the proteins, there were cute cornish game hens that were only a touch dry, and sliced turkey that would have been better if slicer guy would have given me some dark meat. I had heard fine things about the lamb, but the lamb was not fine my friends. Both chops I sampled were way overcooked. Alas.nnI had some asparagus that was also much better than expected, very nicely grilled. zucchinis and squashes, also grilled, assisted in padding all the meat in my gullet.nnCarbs? desserts? No idea.nnOur server was an allstar klutz, but attentive and constatly replenished our beverages  which was some of the best unsweetened brewed iced tea Ive ever had. Also, when we got a little tired we got a pot of coffee  no extra charge, which I think is unusual. It was good. Thanks Wynn!"
1,"This mall is great ! . And the architecture and the design of the stores in the mall and the background on the ceiling is beautiful. They didnt offer all the good stores like fashion mall did, but there are tons of restaurants to choose from. nnthings that stood out??nnTheir urban outfitters has been the most organized store ive seen everrnThe hm store had nothing to offernThey have a cute restaurant cheeseburger las vegas, good food for good price and good customer service.nnGiving them  stars bcus of how the mall is designed outnnand wait i think they only have one restroom ???? i think"
1,"I fly Southwest about  times a month for work. I like it a lot. It doesnt hurt that Im A List so I always get a good seat. Also, I like that bags fly free. One benefit I was reminded of today was the fact they dont charge for changes to your flight. I tried to change a reservation on United today and was told Id have to pay about  for the ticket change and another  or so for the new flight. WTF! Thats at least as much as I paid initially for BOTH flights. None of that with Southwest. The other benefit is Southwest has a really good inflight magazine. I always enjoy the articles. I do wish they had wifi on more of their flights though."
1,The truth???  Ive been here twice this week nnDelicious! Im in love with the pulled pork entree with their hot bbq sauce. Its just fantastic. A plus also is their coleslaw is made wo mayo which made me very happy and is great with the pork. They have a huge menu with lots of options you are sure to find something you will like. The sides for me in general are just ok to be honest but when I come here I come for the meat anyway.nnMy boyfriend loves their ribs and also their fried zucchini are huge and cooked just right. nnnIm a regular now and plan on keeping it that way for my pulled pork munchies
1,"best coffee, cakes, cute things, and this comes fom a proclaimed badass. this place is warm and inviting and cozy and smells so good and the staffowner were so happy and warm. buy a new book, go here and grab a coffee and sit on the comfy old couch and greatly waste an afternoon."
1,"I cant believe I dont go here more often than I have. It had been several years since Ive been here and I have now made it twice in the past month. The walk is pleasant and there is a wide variety of animals to see. The animals are not always active, but that is part of their nature. The zoo is wellkept with the exception of face smears that the kiddos leave on the glass. You may also see the peacocks roaming around the area. You cant miss the aquarium either. There are plenty of fish to see and a handson tank where you can touch some freshwater stingray. nnThe bear exhibits, which are the oldest at the zoo, are being renovated. Dont be too disappointed  theres plenty more to see. Plan to spend at least  hours if youre visiting."
1,"I love CLT!! My favorite airport to get stuck in. The people are nice, the food is greasy and somewhat southern, the wifi is free, and they have rocking chairs! What more could you ask for? Seriously."
1,"Hard to find real Italian food in Arizona.  Lets face it everyone can claim it, but hard to match NY style Italian.  Brio, being a chain itself, rises above the other chains and offers some higher quality Italian cooking.nnMy wife always gets the whole roasted chicken which is really good.  Its some of the best restaurant chicken Ive had.nnIm partial to trying something different each time I come here, sticking with some pasta dish heck I can get a steak somehwere else.  The ala Vodka dishes are great and anything with prosciutto is tasty.nnThis is a great place for smallish date night group of friends.  Service is always good for us, selection is consistent with specials when you want them and the quality of the food has been excellent for me each time.nnTip check out the happy hour times to save some cash"
1,"Its not express but it tastes good!  I find it fairly difficult to find a Pho place out in Vegas that tastes authentic.  Rainbow Pho Express is pretty authentic!  Reminds me of the Pho places I love back in San Jose, CA where you know Pho is authentic because of the number of Vietnamese residents that reside there.nnMy go to items to order are of course the Special Combination Pho soup, fried egg rolls that come w lettuce to wrap and dip in the fish sauce, and my ultimate favorite is their vermicelli bowl equipped with grilled shrimp and fried egg rolls.  Their rice plates with pork chop is real good too.  Everything is flavorful here and I love their Pho broth there is no need to add sauces to it, just some lime and jalapeno for a little kick!  They have an abundance of veggies in their vermicelli bowl which is why its my favorite!nnI knocked off a star because they dont have very many chicken dishes, or none at all on their menu which I find weird.nnOverall, great place to go.  But be warned, it aint express!"
1,"If you get the  bedroom villa your in LUCK. nJacuzzi tubs  in both bathrooms AND a jacuzzi on the balcony. nSo lavish nGreat pool viewnVERY SPACIOUS nI mean wow nNice big flatscreens with a DVD player, Surroundsound  only negative was the remote was so confusing to use nEven have a bar for entertaining!!nLike seriously it gets better, nNice kitchen fully loaded with a dishwasher and all the cooking and baking utensils you will need! nI am telling you this place had it all! nnEven the slides at the pool were pretty damn amazing. nnONLY negative is this is not a hotel where housekeeping comes daily. But you can order room service, and towels and material that you would need. nThey service all needs!"
1,"The food here is hands down, unbelievably delicious... we typically get the chicken or veggie tacos and the chile relleno... and extra chips and salsa please! Whenever we have a hankering for authentic, flavorful, awaken your taste buds food we come here... our toddler loves it too!"
1,"this show was AMAZING! there were some parts that kind of creeped me out a bit...the baby strollers and the baby sounds before the show and when the guys with the white wigs were walking out of the side doors and just kind of stood in the audience. i dont really know if i fully understand the concept of the show but i dont really care because all the acrobatics and dancing was amazing. the comedy was funny too, i really like how they get some of the audience involved in the show. best part was the two guys doing the hand balancing. FUCKING nuts! those guys were so strong its almost ridiculous. nni honestly dont what else to say other than GO SEE IT!!"
1,"I absolutely love this place! The fact its only a couple miles from my house is an added bonus. nnIts authentic northeastern Thai food. Its very good. Ive backpacked through the region and know the cuisine, obviously not as much as someone whos lived there for years as an expat, or a resident, but I feel I got a grasp of the cuisine in the month I lived there. nnThis place is phenomenal. Its the best Thai food Ive had in the valley. Obviously its not your typical Thai food restaurant, due to it being NE Thai, but dont let that turn you away. Dont let any of the bad reviews turn you away, Ive been blown away by the food. nnTheir salads are all phenomenal. There is one with lettuce, glass noodles, bean sprouts, pork, and shrimp forgot the name! and thats my favorite. If youre not into spicy, order at a  or  spicy and theyll bring out the chili spice for you to put on yourself. Ive ordered it a  spicy and its almost too much for me to handle, and I LOVE spicy food and especially Thai spicy. They serve a pitcher of water at every table. Their larb salad is also todiefor. nnThey serve traditional Thai soups like shrimp and rice, chicken and rice..etc. Theyre so good and a meal in and of themselves."
1,"My coworker and I were in Charlotte for business and had been hearing about Macs for several days, so decided to take a shot.  nnI love a good dive and Macs fit the bill perfectly!  The inside eating area is open and spacious, and theres a neat patio area out front.  nnWe arent from the south so our goal was to eat only southern food.  I had the BBQd pulled pork Cuban sandwich, my coworker had the combo platter which consisted of brisket, pork, ribs and turkey.  We also ordered fried pickles and hush puppies.nnIll spare you the details but suffice it to say everything was DE LI CIOUS!  Only a couple exceptions  Ive had a Cuban sandwich in Florida and Im not sure this was authentic.  But the pork was fantastic.  My coworker said the combo was awesome but she didnt like the turkey.  nnOur server was a spunky gal named Rosalee, youll be in great hands if she waits on you.  She gave us great advice on what to order, also provided alot of information about the local area. nnIf you are in Charlotte on business there are a million restaurants downtown Uptown? within walking distance.  But this joint is worth the train ride.  Pick up the train at the Epicenter and get off at New Bern.  Walk about  blocks and there you are.  nnEnjoy!"
1,"FantastiqueLe Cirque at Las Vegas is a very Paris inspired interior.  Something I would expect from Sirio Maccioni a reincarnation of the venerable and amazing Le Cirque.  The Foie Gras was amazing, flawless.  The food was entirely fresh and the service was professional and nice.  A good environment topped off with a great wine makes for a spectacular evening.nnBuen Provecho!"
1,"The brisket is wonderful, super tasty bark, nice smoke ring.  We got the cutters choice which is in between the juicy yet fattier cut and the lean cut, a good all round compromise.  Wasnt a big fan of the sauces, not bad but nothing spectacular but the brisket is so good you really dont need any.nnThe maccheese is good, as is the cole slaw, wasnt a fan of the cream corn, just too sweet for me. I wish they had some greens to choose from."
1,"This place stands out among the TONS of froyo places sprouting up. Its always pretty clean and the staff are always very friendly. I come here pretty regularly and while once in awhile Im bummed out because of a lack of good flavors and an abundance of weird ones, I always find something thats good. A little pricey but than most froyo places are. Definitely worth it to sign up for the loyalty texts!"
1,"This is a hole in the ground kinda place... you heard me, I said ground not wall, considering you literally walk down a narrow stairwell to get to the little door in order to discover this little establishment.  By the way, I do mean LITTLE, Ive seen someones bathroom bigger than this joint.nnLets be real peeps... this place is put in the Dive Bar category for a reason.  Besides, the place is called Jeffs Bucket Shop,  I seriously for the longest time dont even know of its existance... or what the heck Jeff is selling by the bucket, or if Jeff is trying to sell buckets, or who the heck is Jeff?!  So yes, there maybe a little weird smell frankly I dont even pay attention to it, and I have a super good nose, but I do have high tolerance for weird smell courtesy of my heritage lol.  My personal suggestion is stop asking what the heck that smell is because you probably dont want to know and just keep drinking.nnI have been here mostly on Fridays and they have karaoke.  I think they have karaoke on other nights too.  Not sure if they always have the same host, and if he is the regular, let me warn you, he doesnt play... he will gong you off that stage like youre on Apollo if you are seriously tonedeaf.  nnThis place gets packed.  So if you have issues with being too crowded, well... not sure if you want to sardine your way into here on a weekend night.  And again, if you are the higher maintanence type, you may want to stick with your safer choices and go next door or across the street or uptown.  But honestly, its always a good crowd, nice people having fun together, beer isnt too expensive, and I always have a blast here."
1,Love this place!  The food really does taste like youre eating at a Roman Trattoria. Its pretty small on the inside so watch your elbows. Its also in an unassuming location in the middle of a strip mall so keep your eyes out for the big sign that says theyve been on The Food Network otherwise you might just drive on by.nnTheir Spaghetti Carbanara may have been the best Ive ever had.  Buon Appetito!
1,"I live downtown  I LOVE Chinese food. Living down here its been wonderful having the ability to have things delivered other than pizza. nSO... my fiancue  I order from here often enough that I believe they know us by name practically.nEverything weve ordered has been really good. Not epic good... but good.. EXCEPT their peppered chicken IS amazing good. BIG AWESOME GOOD... a must if you order from here.... its basically the best thing they have on their entire menu.. Im pretty sure thats totally accurate. nI order online mostly but when I do call in an order  the person who answers is always nice  easy to understand. The delivery person is always smiley  super nice too.nOne time they forgot our steamed dumplings  I called  told them the problem... the person came back  delivered them within a few minutes of the mishap  was super apologic  really sweet.nI know this place has gotten some rotten reviews over some time but its very easy to do that as people dont always give the happy reviews when theyre pleased typically.nSO, I say  give it a try people  order the peppered chicken  its excellent  youre welcome in advance  if youre happy  write a happy review."
1,"This place is top notch. The service is impeccable, the food is great and always fresh and the bread...mmmmm the bread, so good.  The best around.nnThe service is good, people are nice especially considering this place is a zoo .  There is always a smile on their face and always happy to accommodate, which is hard to come by nowadays."
1,"This steak house is worth the splurge.  I treated my husband to Prime for his th birthday.  We were seated in their more intimate dining room, a remarkable view of the fountain show...the best seats in the house!nnThe kale Caesar salad was surprisingly good.  Its the perfect summer salad.  My husband  was completely silent as he inhaled his  French onion soup.  Afterwards, he had a huge Kool Aid smile.  The salmon,  NY steak, mac and cheese,  truffled potatoes, and chocolate cake were all stellar.   The view was extraordinary!  A table elegantly placed  near a window  with  gorgeous  panoramic  look into the  dancing waters of the Bellagio fountain, and the strip in the backdrop!nnLove  it and going back for more!"
1,"A few of us went to Honey Pig last night and we had a great time minus the fact that it took our waitress  minutes to approach our table. We did the  AYCE of course and it did not disappoint. We didnt do anything too crazy... just the bulgogi, pork belly, short rib, chicken and octopus. Personally I think there just were not enough banchan and our waitress did not refill our bean sprouts even once. nnAlso, Ive been to the Honey Pig in LA and they serve the sweet rice at the end which I enjoyed quite a bit. Vegas Honey Pig didnt do that. Not sure if they generally dont or just forgot with us. My husband enjoyed Honey Pig and we will definitely go back again soon but not without taking him to the LA location first.nnMmmmm piggies..."
1,"Awesome shop with a massive juice collection. Space jam andromeda all day. The standard, Jameson, five pawns, the list goes on. Customer service is awesome! Ed is always helpin out and sports on the tvs is a plus lol! I can kick it there and try flavors for a good while sometimes too! Check it out you wont be disappointed. Rebuildables welcome."
1,"Like most reviewers, I, too, have seen all of Cirque du Soleil shows in Vegas and some of their road shows.  By far KA made the most impression on me.  Who would have thought anyone could perform on an absolute vertical line stage!!  Amazingly magical is an understatement!  nnSkip the Blue Man Group and come see this show.  It will make your Vegas trip well worth it."
1,"Ok so I might be a bit biased when I say this is the best brewery in AZ.  Probably because my best friend works there BUT aside from that this really is the best brewery out that way!  nnEven for someone that isnt much of a beer drinker they have beers for everyone!  They have the Kilt Lifter, similar to guiness that my husband loves all the way t the Peach Ale which is light and sweet and right up my ally.  They provide samplers to see which one fits your taste.nnAside from the beer the food is AMAZING.  I love the brunch they have every weekend.  Enchilada and eggs are my fav so far.  The chicken rolls are fantastic especially dipped in the sweet jalapeno sauce.  The sandwiches are fresh and HUGE!!  The service you get here is one of a kind and the place is so big you ALWAYS have a seat.nnI highly recommend stopping by for a brew and chicken rolls to watch a game.  And make sure to give Michelle a BIG tip!"
1,"Cool experience!! nnWhen else do you get to say you rode a ride that is  stories above the ground? At its maximum height, this ride reaches  feet! It surprisingly is not at scary as it sounds. It was just pure fun with a one of a kind view of Vegas. Unless you have a severe fear of heights, I would recommend that you take a chance and try it!"
1,"Jasmine Tokyos goal is apparently to be the gold standard of Chinese buffet, and it will cost you substantial gold, even with the Yelp off checkin deal or one of the coupons they send occasionally. Unlike some buffets in the region, the slight queasiness you may feel afterwards is from damage to your wallet, not to your stomach.nnSUSHInThe sushi section is huge, creative, and goodforbuffetquality so, better than supermarket, better than the secondbest place on Thomas Road, but not so good as a serious sushi restaurant where its made right when you order it. If your goal is to fill up on sushi, you will probably come out ahead here. Theyve also added little plates of sashimi, which in late afternoon were not at their peak. If you come when theyre busy and refreshing this a lot, you will probably do better.nnMONGOLIAN BBQnIt exists. I resist buffet features that require interacting with servers, so Ive never tried it, and I veered that direction only to obtain SESAME BALLS and those cheesecovered scallop things in shells. This place has the best sesame balls filled with bean paste. Should I ever decide to invent the Sesame Ball Diet, I will eat here regularly,  sesame balls at a sitting.nnSALAD AND COLD THINGSnIgnore the shrimp, unless its peak period and being refreshed often. The little spicy squid in the other cold section, however, are excellent. BITE THEY LITTLE HEADS OFF, nibble on they tiny feet!nnHOT FOODnThe selection here is smaller than at cheaper buffets, so there was only one style of dim sum pot stickers filled with BBQ pork, I think, none of the usual nonChinese offerings possibly not a loss, depending, and a limited array of main dishes. The up side is that the main dishes are mostly restaurantquality rather than arrive in a dump truck from buffet central quality. So its very nongloppy, things taste like something other than sauce, and if a dish purports to contain meat, the meat is the major part, not something you have to hunt amidst cheap vegetables. The walnut shrimp is outstanding.nnDESSERTnAgain, I refuse to interact with icecream scoopers and, in fact, Ive never seen that station staffed anyway. The serveyourself selection contains many of the usual suspects and a few surprises. The mango puddingcake thing is good, but avoid the pineapple cake. There are cheesecake bites! Have a cheesecake bite!nnHeck, have another sesame ball! You know you want to."
1,"Stopped in quick on my lunch break because my bangs needed a trim so bad! I didnt have to wait long at all, considering it was a walkin during lunch time. Store was clean and all the hairdressers were friendly.nnAmy gave me a quick fix and made sure that I liked how they laid. I was a little picky and she was more than happy to cut it the way I like them.nnI plan to go back for a full haircut soon!"
1,"Tasty French Toast, no powdered sugar,  too messy for that! Turkey patty sausage, scrambled eggs. Busy time and mob level folks! Noise level up! Waiters and waitresses still calling you GUYS! RUDE. But nice otherwise. Mgt. Issue!"
1,"I finally returned and I am glad that I did. The off putting smell of eggs upon entering is no longer there. The service was extremely attentive and efficient. We were seated immediately and our drinks came out quickly. The server was pleasant and professional. I ordered the Spicy Miso Burger and we shared the oxtail chili cheese fries appetizer. We cleaned our plates! The burger was so much better than I remember, and it appears that some positive changes were implemented since my last visit over six months ago. Another great local business to add back to my list of neighborhood favorites!"
1,"Great China   chinese restaurant and super buffet there is no the in the name.But there is some good food inside the place.the decor is average and are booth was comfy but well worn.The buffet had about  items ,about the super buffet requirement.They had a small sushi section and the sushi was very tasty.The wonton soup i had was very hot and good it had most of your typical trays with a couple of different twists on some like the stuffed clams were huge and and they had some good sole,that thet called snow fish?When i left this place i was stuffed and everything i ate was good.So yes Great China gets  stars.And for Norm R. they got the almond cookie packages"
1,"I LOVE BOLD!!! I am an esthetician in Los Angeles, CA, and Kamela came to me for a facial. I dont tan anymore so I can save my skin from aging and sun damage. I have had spray tanning in the past and I have been really unhappy with the results. When I get sprayed by Kamela I look awesome!!!! Its even and its a fantastic golden brown color, very very natural looking. The last time I got sprayed by her I had lunch with my friend the next day and she was SO impressed... she said my tan was amazing and that it looked so natural and beautiful. Even my boyfriend loved it and he usually hates it when i get sprayed.nnGo to BOLD!!!! You will be sooooo happy!!!!!"
1,"Good brunch menu with many options. This location feels like a bar. I have been to other locations with outside seating and preferred that. nnThey have free wifi if you ask for a password which is great for yelping nnAs for food  my eggs were great. I liked the pairing of the greens with the eggs, bread and sauce. It was well executed. The potatoes were a bit blend and dry for my taste. I tried to add ketchup to them, but didnt help.nnI liked that the served fruit with the dish. I enjoy fruit at all times of the day.nnMy freshly squeezed orange juice was sweet and tasty. My boyfriend ordered a smoothie. The smoothie tasted healthy. It tasted like it had fresh fruit and yogurt, but needed something extra for flavor.nnOverall, I liked the place and will be back. Hoping to try the crepe next time. Will avoid the potatoes."
1,"Just ordered my first delivery order!!!  This is the best.  I had the Slob Cobb, which was a great portion and very fresh.  I also had the meaty bun, snack size, wish this were a full size burger.  It was delicious.  They forgot an item on my delivery, but they came very quickly once I called to let them know.  Will certainly be back to try the other items on the menu.  Great customer service and friendly."
1,"Ive just moved to Leith, and Im already sure that Sofis is going to become my favourite local hangout spot.  Just minutes away from the scenic Shore area, Sofis is laidback and quirky without being pretentious, with all the right ingredients to become a real home from home.nnBy day, its a great place to come and use their free wifi while listening to good music and eating tasty nachos or hummous and olives, or perhaps even have a beer outside if its sunny.  In the evening its more of a hip bar, that attracts an interesting crowd, serves exciting cocktails, yet remains relaxed.  Little touches like the candles and flowers on each table add to the homely feel, while staff are always nice and chatty.nnOn Mondays they host a weekly film night in the back room, while Tuedays play host to knitting night.nA Pe"
1,"This place was awesome! I called them  minutes before they closed to see if they had some items, they did and they had them ready for me when I arrived just before closing. It was In and out, and they were very helpful. A little pricey but I guess most vitamin supplements are. Definitely coming back!"
1,"Love this Casino !!!  the rooms are Gorgeous ! they have wonderful Restaurants, beautiful Chandelier Bars, and they have  Fantastic Pools to choose from, this is my favorite place in Las Vegas now, it used to be Caesars Palace !!! oh! they have a microwave, dishwasher, and a minibar in room !"
1,I love this place me and my mom go every other week for football and it is always packed with Seahawks fans and the severs are great they remember our orders and every thing I tell any seahawks fan about this place.nnGo Hawks!!!
1,"Awesome meal!  Most of the meals that I read about are locally sourced  GREAT JOB!nnWe are outside and the day was perfect  great people watching.nnThe Pimento Cheese sandwich was a great appetizer, split of course.nnThe meatloaf sandwich was divine and the Guilford County Catfish sandwich blew my mind  KABOOM!nnRUN HERE AND EAT  NOW!  The service was great and the owner came around to say hello several times.nnNot inexpensive, but well worth it to support local businesses and growing operations."
1,"I love that there isnt ever really a line. THis is definitely one of the chill spots along the strip at NYNY.  It isnt a big deal of a place like Marquee or XS or any of those. But, this is all you could ever really need. This spot doesnt charge an arm and a leg for entrance. If youre lucky, you might meet someone who can get you into this spot for free or at least for a RED cost. The red cost is usually about  for each guy. Ladies can typically get in for free. YAY The music is usually pretty good, hip hop, top  hits and occasionally some house. THe lighting here is what I like. Instead of the typical strobe lights and things, this spot has tons of TVs on the walls. The lighting and much of the effects come from here. Drinks cost the usual, about  for a Jack and Coke and things like that. Not all the bartenders are a heavy pour but if youre lucky, youll find a bar tender that knows their stuff and doesnt measure. Just have a good time and enjoy the crowd. Thats what its all about."
1,"I need to start by saying I eat boneless wings almost every chance I get because in my head I justify them as being healthy and low carb with complete disregard for the breading. Wing Stop is stellar for several different reasons. Especially this specific location.nnFor one thing, they get your name when u are ordering and they actually use it again for personal touch. LOVE this. Secondly the wings.......served hot, cripsy and fast! The flavor of the BBQ sauce is a love affair in my mouth of sweet, brown sugar and smokey mesquite goodness. I cannot recomment the BBQ with ranch dipping sauce enough. Now, the Pamesan Garlic didnt do it for me. This still did not stop me from stuffing them in my face, but just not as sexy as the BBQ.nnThe food is delicious and the staff is on point with the service by making me feel welcomed from the moment I walked in until I left. The only reason why they are not getting a five star is because I still think Wingstop is a bit pricey. Heres a tip though. On Monday and Tuesday they do offer . cent boneless wings....... Just dont let my stalkers know this!!!!"
1,"Weve been using Park Ave Cleaners now for almost  years. We bring in coats with belts, suits, button up shirts, etc. The belt is always with the coat and tagged separately so it has never been lost. The shirts are always laundered and pressed nicely. Staff is polite, most things are ready within a couple of days, and the price is great. What more do you want from your cleaner?"
1,"Rula Bula is a cool irish pub located on Mill Ave. They did have an outside area, but it  was very busy so we where sitted inside. The food was really good. I loved the appetizer sampler that I ordered. nnThere was a live band on night we where in there. Very hard to talk to anyone. So FYI not a good date place after certain hours as you can hear each other."
1,"WOW! What a great venue, great seating seems a little intimate than most big venues, I really enjoyed the Belk Bowl. nnBlake Shelton was awesome, The game was bitter sweet I am Cincy Born and Bred and TARHEEL WED! GO HEELS, No Seriously Wife GO HEELS!! lol"
1,Probably the best Mexican restaurant Ive been to in Vegas so far. I got the wet burrito and it was really good. The beans and guacamole were the best. I also tried pineapple and raisin tamales for the first time and that was good too. The service was excellent.
1,"My mom rocks. Besides being awesome on many different counts, she introduced Blueberry Hill to me. Now, shes not a foodie, but she knows good breakfast grub. nnShes no urban adventurer either, so I was surprised to see that she left the Strip to find a new breakfast spot. One of the things I love and hate about Vegas are the plethora of eateries in your hotel, forcing you to stay in. But a favorite pastime of mine now is to venture from the Strip to find the local favorites.  nnI think I struck gold with Blueberry Hill. Everything, and I mean everything Ive ever had here has been mouthwatering, hangovercuring, delicious.  Whether its savory or sweet  its ALL good here. I usually go for the Dealers Special with a hamsteak and hash browns, but another good option is any number of the Mexican breakfasts with chorizo.  Even the breakfast burrito was impressive. Their signature blueberry pancakes do not disappoint either.nnIts unassuming with its dumpy naughahyde booth diner look.  But thats why its even more of a surprise find.  You can easily eat here for under .  nnBtw, theres a location just east of Maryland Parkway thats closer to the Strip."
1,"I ate lunch at Frans last week for the first time and WOW! Im going to be back again and again.  I like the eclectic menu, its not the usual boring..... burger, some sort of chicken, some sort of fish, sandwich with some canned choices of a side dish. Oh No,  Frans menu is pure innovation. My server was well versed with the specials of the day and gave great service.  I got the sense that they mix it up in there from day to day.  nnI had what they called a meatball slider and Madone was it good.  I had a side of Mac and Cheese which I consider myself a MC connoisseur  Even the Mac and Cheese had a Fran twist that separates it from the pack using several shapes of pasta and a few different cheeses.  It was the best MC Ive ever had in Charlotte including what used to be my favorites Lupies and Macs BBQ.nnI was also impressed with the presentation. My ten dollar lunch was presented and garnished with the care, pride and attention like that of a Saturday Night, Uptown  Entruee at the newest sheik place with a trendy one syllable name.   The tableware was really cool and retro styled Melmac or Fiestaware like very fitting of the charmingness and uniqueness of Frans.nnFran came out, introduced herself, welcomed me, asked what I thought and even gave me a couple of cookies.  How great is that?nnIn short, awesome menu, excellent service at a great value.  Should I become a serial killer though not likely, get captured, found guilty and sentenced to the death penalty, I want my last meal to be Frans Mac and Cheese."
1,"Spring Restaurant Week  finally gave me the opportunity to check out le faux Tour Eiffel. In my OpenTable reservation, I mentioned RW and the fact that I would like a seat overlooking the Bellagio fountains.nnSilly me. The fountains dont start up until pm. We did get our window seat, at least. Though I didnt check out the other side, Im happy our table was along the window angled toward Bellagio, Cosmopolitan, and the Paris balloon. The view was so enjoyable, we didnt miss the fountains at all.nnI suppose I should talk about the food. In a word, it was outstanding. They started us out with the amusebouche of the day. It was some sort of sunchoke mousse and it certainly amused my bouche. But the star of the meal for me was the beet salad. Easily the best beet salad Ive ever had, the RW menu description reads, Spring Greens, Smoked Candy Striped, Red And Golden Beets, Fromage Blanc. Duelicieux!nnNot wanting to turn this into a novel, the main course Sauteed Veal Medallion, Green Pea Mousseline, Wild Forest Mushrooms and dessert Mixed Berry Pudding, Strawberry, Blueberry, Raspberry, Framboise, Creme Fraiche were also fantastic. Wait a second. Framboise means raspberry. Redundant!nnThe wonderful setting and the fabulous food would be diminished if the service wasnt also impeccable. Our waiter knew we were there for RW and he was very knowledgeable about our meal. I chose to do the  wine pairing and I enjoyed his tidbit about Willamette Valley being the same latitude as the best pinot regions in France. Sure made that glass of vin taste just that much better. It was also a nice finishing touch as he brought out a selection of chocolates and candy. My choice of passion fruit jelly was delectable.nnHaving been to la vraie Tour Eiffel, Ive been skeptical about visiting the Vegas version. But this restaurant, with its romantic window tables, has made me a believer. I look forward to returning for dinner with the Bellagio fountains in full force."
1,"Just landed in Phoenix, picked up my rental car, and headed to this place to meet up with a friend for lunch. I loved this place! A seat outside at the covered bar, the warm sun baking, a glass of cold ice tea, and a steak wrap. Exactly what I needed to unwind after a long flight.nnI would love to come back to this place again, day or night, for a couple drinks and more excellent food."
1,You have not eaten in Vegas until youve had the Combo Pan Roast at the Oyster Bar at the Palace Station!  We all know that the Palace Station is not one of the most savory locations in Las Vegas but its definitely worth the trip to this seedier Hotel.  The cooks prepare your food according to your requested spice level between  and   being the least spicy and  being very spicy.  I could eat at this place everyday and never get tired of it!  I highly recommend it!
1,"Ive been to the ones in Cali, hoping that this was just as friendly and satisfying. nnDefinitely out of two times eating there and a few other cafeteria spots, this is probably the better of what Ive tried in the area. I havent tried any sit down filipino spots, but I think that should deserve a separate category.  Food is nicely seasoned and not too greasy or skimpy on the meats and didnt have a gross amount of meat to fat ratio this coming from someone who LOVES fat...sometimes its just too much at some joints . The people who work here are very friendly too. nnThis though is great because many of these dishes take so long and I normally dont want to cook it.  I particularly dont live very filipino I dont have TFC at home, or cookeat out filipino often or have much flip friends to talk Tagalog with. Its just kinda nice sometimes to be with my people and eat a variety of things from my heritage and watch Woowoowee on the TV. Of course I miss my moms cooking she is the best cook out of her  siblings clan, but going to someplace to eat dishes kinda gives a little bit of that home comfort.  Its small things, but means something....I dont ever want to lose that part of myself that is Filipino."
1,Harrahs got it right with this property.  You cant beat the location.  You can rest here and hop around the strip.  I love the Tower Experience.  Great Spa and Pool.  Decent Rooms and worth the price!  Comped rooms are always a good deal.  Cant wait to get back.
1,"Awesome place. I went in only knowing that I wanted to make a dark room. I walked out with everything to not only make my own dark room, But the confidence that I would do it right. Only going off of what I did in high school the guys there showed me all the equipment that I need and also told me how to use them to get the best results. I cant wait to go back in and learn about new stuff that I can do."
1,"The low carb margarita is so awesome. Its unfortunate that its , but its worth it. nnThe customer service is very good. Guacamole . and queso with chorizo . are good, not the best but worth it."
1,"The shaved ice here is amazing. Good selection to choose from as well. The service however leaves much to be desired. The place is often staffed by a skeleton crew of teenagers so there is always a wait. The last time I was in, the two behind the counter were bad mouthing the owner...  Very unprofessional."
1,"For any cook this place is heaven! It is easy to walk in and get overwhelmed with the amazing choices they offer. nnMy fiance stumbled across this place when looking for Christmas gift ideas for me needless to say, it was a wonderful Christmas for me. Months later he decided to take me there to check it out. nnFor years I had been looking for a good adobo spice as the one my mother in law gave me years before had ran out and was never to be found again the adobo I found here was one of many kitchen treasures we have come to experience with their spices. nnAs another Yelper stated, the spices can cost a bit more than McCormicks, but they are WELL WORTH IT. The spices are still decently prices in my experience. nnI love to cook and I especially love to feed people this place appeals to that exact need of mine. When I cook for large groups of people, I am often asked what spice I used in my dish. Some of the phenomenal spices I can vouch for include Vietnamese Cinnamon, Adobo, Arizona Dreaming, Sunny Paris, Chipotle, and the Mexican Oregano. nnEnjoy, I know you will ."
1,Came here needing to change our titles to PA after moving from California.   Service was very nice and the staff was extremely helpful... Its not an easy process and at least theyre very accommodating.
1,"the food is hit or miss. however it is delicious most of the time. a couple times i ordered something weird sounding and it was weird tasting. i wouldnt recommend trying anything youve never had before. however their greek fries, fire cheese appetizers, and steak medallion entree is absolutely mouth watering. their fallafel sandwich is ok, the greek dressing is good. NOT AS AUTHENTIC AS SOME GREEK PLACES BC ITS A CHAIN, BUT STILL PRETTY GOOD. they dont explain the menu enough thoughthat is a complaint since its all in greek words. service was good."
1,"daughter and i were in vegas in april this year,. we had a coupon for  buy one get one free  entree she had mushroom chicken and i had   shrimp and chicken with pineapple.. the   entree  on both was  fresh and  good.. the  plate  was huge i am  headed back to vegas  june  th.. and  wil  go back here..  yummmmmmmm"
1,"These guys are awesome! They had to move me twice in one month which was a feat, considering my hoarding tendencies. They packed and moved it all quickly and with smiles on their faces. They are super friendly and professional, plus their prices are great. They didnt even complain about the plethora of dog and cat hair that starting whirling around the house once they moved my furniture. I would recommend them to anyone! In fact, I will be moving again in a few weeks hopefully for the last time and I would love for them to come out here to California and do it!"
1,"YUMMM! Sad that there wasnt graham cracker flavor when I was here but had the peanut butter and it was AMAZING. First of all, the way they serve it is BEAUTIFUL. Its perfectly swirled. Secondly, the flavors are amazing. I sampled a couple and it was really hard to make a decision but peanut butter is definitely my fave. Hoping they open more locations soon!"
1,"Stumbled in to the Terrace POinte Cafe after a a typical vegas night. Shows, clubbing, bodalicious strippers and, of course, excessive alcohol consumption. nnThe raspberry french toast was the perfect endingbeginning to the morning. A very generous helping of stacked french toast, and the raspberry was complementary rather than overwhelming. A perfect balance between sweet and sour. nnThe service was also fantastic. I loved our waitress who was friendly and cheerful at  in the morning. Needless to say, I definitely enjoyed my breakfast."
1,"What a gorgeous concept for a place, everything here is in a rich, dark and very velvety red theme that covers the floors, ceilings and everything in between. I love the look and feel of this place but I guess it still needs a little more development since it was only opened about two years ago. They barely have anything on the floor portion and the casino is absolutely tiny in comparison to the Wynn which is already small in comparison to many other hotels  casinos. nnThe restaurants in here look like they have potential but again ... too new to judge because I went to one of the cafes and the bartenders were still dropping the glasses everywhere. I am not opposed to the Encore but I feel like it has the same effect as Palazzo on the Venetian except smaller. Its basically the same thing and with the price difference I dont think its worth picking one over the other if thats all youre going after especially since the Wynn is far more established and has much more grandeur."
1,"While randomly searching the internet for Vegan restaurant Scottsdale, I stumbled upon Nourish. Nourish is a new restaurant that has only been open a couple weeks. What I love about their menu is that they denote vegan menu items.nnNourish Menu nhttpnourish.comwpcontentuploadsmenunourishupdated.pdfnn of their  starters, sides and snacks are vegan  are vegetariann of their  soups and salads are vegan  are vegetariannAll beverages are vegann of their  sandwiches are vegan  are vegetariannAll  Nonbeef burgers are vegann of their  entrees is vegan  are vegetariannThey rotate their desserts, including vegan selectionsnnToday we decided to get takeout to eat by the pool, since it is such a lovely day. We both ordered the sweet teriyaki burgers.nnThe burger is an amazing combination of chickpea, sweet potato and black beans with a slightly spicy seasoning. It is served with airfried without oil crispy sweet potato waffle fries. The fries are seriously craveworthy. They are seasoned with cinnamon, which I thought was a surprisingly good flavor combo. The burger is normally served on a bed of greens, but we got ours on multigrain buns lucky for us. I cant imagine this burger without the bun the bun was the perfect compliment to the burger. We got the teriyaki sauce on the side, along with a garlic dressing that I didnt see mentioned on the menu and they were both awesome. The burger came with cucumber, tomato, onion and lettuce.nnWe decided to try the Ogave sodas and they were awesome. We had the cola and mandarin key lime flavors.nnWe asked about vegan desserts and sprung for some vegan chocolate chai ice cream. OMFG. The ice cream, which is made with coconut milk, was probably the most amazing flavor of ice cream I have ever had. The takehome container had  baby scoops...I could have eaten like  scoops of it. It was so good that I want to go buy an ice cream maker just to try to recreate the flavor at home.nnThis new restaurant will be seeing a lot of me....I already want to go back for nds."

1,"The newest and by far cleanest gay bar in Vegas. Clean and a bit industrial feel to it, in a good way. A great place to have very reasonably priced drinks and meet people. They have two good pool tables so this is our getaway during the week. nnThe crowd is very mixed and I dare say predominately late twenties to middle aged guys. With a few fag hags, twinks, retires, and maybe a lost homeless man thrown in for diversity sake.nnThe jukebox is the musical source so its up to the crowd to pick the songs which can be great or painful depending on your preference in music. The place is not too smokey and is big enough to move around if you dont want to be around the smokers.nnGarage is busy all nights of the week right now cause its new and a welcome change from the same old funk the other gay bars offer. Its at a intersection with a traffic light and has plenty of parking around it so thats just a added perk."
1,"I went last night for dinner for my friends birthday. They open at PM for dinner. We were the only ones there and they seated us up front so we could watch the action. We loved that. It is no longer  courses, but . However it is a lot of food. nWe both started with a Cesar salad. It was on a flat bread which was delicious. They also gave us a sample of I believe a salmon tartar. I did not taste it as I  do not eat seafood. I had the steak Diane and it was very good. the steak was cooked perfectly and the potatoes and carrots were a great accompaniment. My friend had the salmon and loved it. The deserts were outstanding and beautiful I had the lava cake my friend the fruit dish. nThe service was great. The food was great. The price was great. Cant wait to go back."
1,"You know what makes the difference between a good pizza and a great pizza?  There are a lot of factors, but I say that one of the big ones is the toppings.  Pepis Pizza has always been a favourite at our house because they put lots of great toppings on the pizza, and they dont skimp!  Add to that hot and fast delivery and youve got a recipe for success!"
1,"Not sure if it is because it is located within walking distance of where I live, the fact that its on the water, the free wifi, the delish coffee or the offthe hook ambiance, but this place has my heart!!  The place is located on Lakeside street which the area appears to be residential then there is this area of retail right in the middle. Super cool.nnCoffee in a mug. nThis is all I had on this visit but, will be back for the scones. There is an area set up with a couch, coffee table and book shelf where you can look directly out the window which overlooks Monona Bay.There are several tables out back on the deck and some tables outside in the front that face the street.  Every other Friday there is acoustic guitar and the bar serves wine and beer.  I have  yet to get down here and check it out. The coffee house is also open WedSun look up hours on website evenings serving wine and beer. Summer Blush is only  a glass!!  Whoaaaa!!!nnIf you are taking a walk or bike ride around Monona Bay, this place is right on your way. Stop and take a break!!"
1,"I love this place.   I was in town, but without my clubs, and I was able to rent more than a few for less than twenty bucks.  Decent driving range, great pro shop and the staff was incredibly nice and personable.  Helped me with all of my requests.  Prices for clothing in the pro shop were pretty good."
1,"Being a sushi virgin I was a bit hesitant given the small menu choices for non sushi however the waitress was very helpful when we asked for advice.nMy friend had teriyaki chicken which came with the best miso soup apparently and I opted for dumplings, a portion of seaweed and spicy salmon maki. The food was super fresh and tasted delicious although I now know how potent wasabi is!nWould recommend booking as its small but please try. ua for three items and a juice. The dragon rolls at the next table looked amazing and are my choice for next time!"

Featuring a menu of expectedly American classics ranging from pancakes and waffles to country fried steaks and eggs it was with a bit of disdain that I arrived to find the Monte Cristo now relegated to the lunch menu but happy to accommodate given the restaurants hour nature it was with a simple request that the sandwich was prepared and arriving on a covered plate alongside the Frosted Flake French Toast both dishes would prove competent , though nothing to write home about, with prices and portions both in line with other Las Vegas Boulevard breakfast joints thus leaving plenty of stomach space for a sampling of the restaurants deep fried dough.

1,"Water wings is great place to get your kids ready for the pools in town.   They are all very friendly and with as many kids that go there they always seem to remember each one individually which is always a welcome thing at any business. nnThe instructors are really great with the kids, especially the younger ones. With crying babies and children afraid of the water, the teachers all seem to have a great calm and patience about them and work through the tantrums until the child is having a blast in the pool. nnThey have showers to rinse off afterward and a play room for the siblings who might not be taking swim classes too. nnThey do parties and Im pretty sure they have some kind of daycamp thing although my daughter is too young for that. nnWe love it there!"

1,"Ive been a fan of Sheila Fleet jewellery for many years and I even wrote about her collections in one of my Higher Art exams at school. One of my friends got The Sands of Time necklace and ring set for her st birthday and for my Christmas a few years ago she bought me the super cute Secret Hearts necklace and seeing as I love all things with hearts on them its one of my favourite pieces of jewellery.nnSheila Fleet jewellery is perfect if you want to give someone a Scottish souvenir and the pieces are classic and arent naff like some other more unimaginative souvenirs. The inspiration for all the collections come from Orkney and Sheila works with silver, and ct gold and many of the pieces have enamel too. Some pieces have a really obvious Scottish connection while others are a bit more subtle.nnSomething a little bit different and great for all ages too."

1,"I contacted Al via email to ask for a quote on a back window decal, he sent me a quick response with a very fair price for the work.  Due to personal over scheduling I missed our first scheduled appointment and Al was nice enough to reschedule me for the next day.  I met Al and his lovely wife today to have a decal put on my back window.  Not only did they put a beautiful decal on my window, he was nice enough to show interest in my business by asking what else I was doing as far as marketing since I am new to the area and building up my clientele and even making some good suggestions on what else I could do to get my name out there.  nnFast, flexible, efficient and affordable!  I highly recommend Banner Plus to anyone looking to get decals done!  I was very happy with the work done for my business"
1,"My very last supper in Phoenix was at Yen Sushi  Sake, omakase all the way. The experience at Yen is topnotch and the staff is on point. Typically if everyone is doing chefs choice, you share all the plates, but in an inspired twist, Chef presented us with individual plates of sashimi. Filled.to.the.brim. Holy cow, this could have been a meal in and of itself, loaded down with octopus, ahi tuna, albacore, salmon so fresh and fatty it melted like butter in my mouth, and two other cuts I cant remember. SO MUCH SASHIMI! Then our table was hit with five more plates of rolls, one right after the other, including the cucumber lollipops, the heart attack, a little tempura, etc. We chowed on all of it, audibly moaning and pointing at things while trying to wrap our mouths around gigantic roll slices.nnBest sushi in the Valley, what more could I possibly say?"
1,This place is amazing. With a city as huge as PhoenixScottsdale and only a handful of places that actually have REAL ORGANIC healthy food it is incredibly refreshing to stumble across Kaleidoscope!!! A neighbor turned me onto them. I had an amazing salad and coffee. The staff was very friendly and informative. If you care what you put into your body check this place out ASAP!!!
1,"Ive been super excited to finally get a Wagamama in Edinburgh and I was not disappointed! The restaurant is clean and modern with bold flashes of colour on the walls that give a cosier atmosphere than other Wagamamas Ive been to. My husband and I went around pm on a Wednesday afternoon. There was a good atmosphere and healthy amount of people. The tables are big and long so sit about , which can be a little restricting if its full. But Im friendly and never find it uncomfortable. They try to spread people out as much as possible, we had half a table to ourselves! There are also comfy booths for  with a great window view out onto Lothian Road, perfect for people watching. Maybe best to avoid if your a noodle slurper like me though! nnAnyway, enough about my eating habits and on to the food! Ah, the beautiful food. I opted for one of my favourites, chicken raisukaree. A great blend of lime and coconut curry with stir fried chicken, mange tout, peppers and onion with steamed rice. This is a seriously satisfying dish. Fresh zingy lime, rich coconut cream and hot chillies all work together to create a perfectly balanced dish. They also serve it with prawns if you prefer which is equally delicious. Aidan went for one of their specials, which change weekly. He had an amazing noodle dish which had a lime and lemongrass base with stir fried chicken and beansprouts, topped off with chopped peanuts. I could not help but steal several large fork fulls of this! The peanuts give it an extra dimension without being as heavy as a satay or a pad Thai. The lime really lifted it and made it taste really fresh and moreish. Its a shame its not a regular, I think I could eat it every time I visited. We also had a side dish of edamame, fresh soya beans cooked in their pods and tossed in chili and garlic salt before serving. Just spicy enough to get your taste buds going! All the main dishes are under ua, our edamame were around ua and are perfect for sharing so I think its very reasonably priced. nGet yourself to Wagamama, its awesome!"
1,"Wonderful service, but the price for what you get is a rip.  I ordered some chicken with lemon and capers dish and that is all you get   pieces of small chicken breasts in a lemon sauce with some capers  .  Granted, the chicken is cooked perfectly, but the sauce is certainly not like the wonderful chicken piccata they used to have no more piccata there.  Just too expensive to get  thin pieces of chicken breasts and NO sides for that amount of money.nMy friend got some pasta dish that was also overpriced and, for me, way too spiced with flakes of red chilis which was too hot.  She liked it...but both of us left saying we would never go back because of the ridiculously overpriced meals there.nNow if the chicken dish came with some sides maybe...but just the chicken only for that price  think not.  nWe tipped the nice waiter very well, cause it isnt his fault.nSorry, Buca, youve gotten too pricey for me for what you serve.  You arent the Ritz Carlton, and Im not coming back and either is my friend.nnUPDATE  Ate there again with another.  Again, fantastic service and I mean fantastic!  I didnt like what I ordered, so when a Manager came by and asked I told him well, Ive never been accused of being shy.  He takes the plate and returns with something I had mentioned I loved.  I mean, how can you beat that????nNow the food quality  Again, excellent!  Had the antipasto salad which was a fresh and crisp and delicious as it could be.  The entrees were cooked perfectly and dont start me on the tiramisu which is beyond great.  nNow for the price which was the main complaint I had before  Again, there was just two of us, but we went for lunch this time.  The bill came to  for  entrees, the salad, the huge tiramisu and one lemonadeBUT for all we hadand we brought home probably more than half of it, so now we have a whole nother dinnerthe food is definitely priced right now AND everything was fresh!  FRESH!  And authentically cooked having spent some time in Italy I feel I have some idea.nnWhere you could really make out with their food and pricing is if you have a party of  or moreand if you have  people in your party you could super makeout here.  If nothing else, you always know the quality of the food and the service is just superior."
1,"If you are not drinking a  margarita, you are wasting your damn life child...nnIf you are reading this because you havent tried Carlitos Burritos yet, I am hear to tell you that you are in for a treat.nnThey are not like to typical joints around town. They are well made and packed with bright flavor.nnThe staff is amazing and friendly. They will help you sort through the menu options and plan your way through a fantastic meal.nnThe environment is comfortable and fun. I always find myself chatting with strangers and sharing tables with first timers."
1,"Certainly one of my favorite places to dine in Scottsdale.  Its such a cozy location, and seems missed by the typical Snottsdale persona. Its not about the flashy, just the food.  Happy hour has amazing prices, with drinks around  and near full meal sized appetizers around .  Outside of happy hour, the duck is my fav with out a doubt.  Cooked to perfection, its juicy and sweet.  Dont forget the green chile Mac and cheese as a side dish!   Wine selection is strong, but not huge.  My only wish is they had more craft beers available.  If youre going to go, make a reservation, they use Open Table."
1,"This place is so cool I cant say enough good things.  I dont come to Scottsdale as often as I used to, but I needed to sit down, fill out some paperwork and have a cup of coffee before I went into an interview at the crack of dawn this morning.  I stumbled upon this place completely by accident, and it was one of the better coffee shops Ive been to in these parts.nnFor starters, even on a weekday at  in the morning, this place was packed! There was a group of bikers pedal bikes not motor bikes that had just come in from an early ride all sitting outside drinking coffee and hanging out.  The inside was full of people doing what they needed to do, all professional looking. Clearly, this is the place to be!nnI went with an iced coffee and a slice of banana bread to hold my stomach down while I quickly filled out some paperwork.  The staff was friendly and courteous. Despite being busy, my drink and food were ready in a jiffy.  I didnt hear them call my drink order, but the girl realized when I poked my head up from the table that I must have been looking for the coffee she just poured.  nnPlace is nicely decorated, and has a full menu of items.  Pricing is decent, and theres plenty of places to sit, indoors and out.  Bathrooms were clean and ready to use, and overall a positive experience. I think they also have free wifi! Check this place out if your in the area...."
1,"Fantastic!!! It was the first time we were at this location,Biltmore, the food was perfect. I never had Sea bass before and I loved it. It was a bit pricey I think but it was well worth the price. It was very tasty with mushrooms, purple potatoes, snap peas and a little asparagus. It had some tasty sauce on it just a little, not too much sort of around the fish. The fish was on top and the veggies were underneath, I will order this again for sure. My hubby had the turkey burger and kale salad and loved it as well.He did say my turkey burgers are better LOL. I dot mind paying higher than usual for dinner as long as it is good and this totally was worth the  range."
1,"Great coffee shop, free wifi, great service! Cant ask for much more. Atmosphere is nice and cozy, and quiet.  Lots of people studying here I think.  Not me though. o  Has outdoor seating too.  Too hot in summer maybe, but great in winter."
1,Amazing pet salon! If you need a new groomer this is where you need to be. My dog was in desperate need of a grooming I have lived in centennial hills for a little over  years. Im so happy I have found a new place for my dog to get groomed. Prices are great and everyone was awesome. Oh and it is the first place in  years that my dog was not dragging her feet before she got to the door.
1,"Amazing food, crap cocktails, great atmosphere.nnNormally, the phrase crap cocktails is a death sentence in my Yelp reviews.  The food was so good I dont even care.  Ill just order a beer next time.nnWe sat at the bar facing the kitchen.  I love an open kitchen.  Forces you to work clean and be tight as a kitchen unit.nnService was exactly as good as it should have been for a restaurant of this caliber.nnThe beef tartare was a revelation.  Ive had my fair share of tartare but this has become my favorite by an order of magnitude.  Perfect texture, perfect amount of egg.nnThe boyfriend had a ginormous piece of salmon with delightful snap peas.  I had the hangar steak with garlic asparagus.  Both were perfect in every way.nnWhen I took my first bite of steak it appeared to be a little over seasoned!  QUE HORRIBLE!  Once I added the mango salsarelish to the next bite I understood!nHow exciting!  The seasoning was balanced perfectly.  Just right. nnThe building is so nondescript I couldnt believe that it housed what has promptly stolen my heart and warmed me up to Pittsburgh.nnPlaces like this in SF usually require a three month reservation window, is in a  neighborhood with no MUNI service and has mediocre service at best.  So excited to go back."
1,"This Frys has some exceptional people working here.  And now, for the rest of the story...nnWherever possible, Frys Gas Stations have been sprouting up throughout the Valley.  This one opened about six months ago.  After having dinner last night at Red House excellent as usual, btw, I noticed I was near empty.nnAs I came in I also realized it was the third of the month.  Since we hadnt gone shopping yet that means we didnt have any points.  No matter I thought, we needed gas.  nnThe attendant, Joe T was outside helping folks. When was the last time your saw a gas station attendant outside helping people?nnJoe does a lot of that I found out.  One woman who had a rental VW, couldnt figure out how to open her tank.  She asked for my assistance, but Joe had fixed it by the time I walked over. I on the other hand was had problems getting the pump to accept my card.  Seems, it doesnt matter if you do not have any points.  Unless you input your Frys card, the machine doesnt work. Doh!nnWell. Joe came by and fixed it. So we got to chatting.  He believes the more time hes spends behind the glass the less time he can be outside helping customers!  He told me he likes being able to help folks.  Feels thats the real job, his job.  Wow!nnSo Four Stars to Joe T for understanding the service end of the pump, and Frys for hiring him.nnNice!"
1,My husband and I stayed here on Thursday and what can I say it was decent for the price. We payed  for one night therefore I was not expecting it to be super luxurious. The room was under my husbands name but he was at a conference therefore I asked if I could check in without him. I was expecting them to say no but surprisingly the guy at the front desk was very nice and accommodating and managed to check me in and give me a key to the room without my husband present. It helped that I had the same last name along with the confirmation email for the room. As hotel guests we got unlimited access to the tower which is normally  per person. You can have unlimited access for up to four people plus we got  for one coupons for the rides. I felt like it was a pretty good value.
1,"Great sushi restaurant inside of Red Rock Casino.  Kinda pricey but a great place for a date night if youre wanting to splurge a little.  The Top  Roll is my favorite and my husband loves the Jeffrey Roll.  Great selection of sake if youre into that...my hubby always tries something different each time we go.  Great selection of specials that are  and under to allow you to order a variety of things without killing your bill.nnThey used to have these todiefor mussels in a spicy coconut broth but they got rid of them because not enough people were ordering them.  Wish they would bring them back. nnDecor is super modern and trendy, service has always been great and its open pretty late on Fridays and weekends."

1,I love my cherry lashes! It saves the hassle of getting ready as I am always on the go. I love the convenience of it and its nice to look pretty all the time when you wake up. I cant go without them and look forward to my appts everytime. Definitely recommend as the pricing is reasonable!
1,"stars without doubt! This is a great place for grabbing a few pints the tap selection is always impressive, building a custom  pack, or buying hard to find limited release brews. The place is on the pricey end of the spectrum with and isnt recommended for someones daily watering hole unless drinking  pints are in your budget, but I try make a weekly trip down to south End to get my Good Bottle fix! nnThe owner is always willing to engage in some solid conversations about various beer related topics a must for a beer snob, and the bartenders are very friendly. Check their websiteFacebook page before you go. They always post up a current tap list and any upcoming events that may be on the calender."
1,"Im a big fan of Zoes kitchen. In fact, I was here earlier today. My first Zoes kitchen experience was in Virginia. I ordered a sandwich, soup and a drink. To be honest, I wasnt blow away by it. This was a few years back.nnAnyways, moving to Charlotte I decided to give it another go since I was aiming to eat healthier. I ordered the chicken kabobs and they were outstanding. Then I went back and ordered the steak kabobs and they too were outstanding. Good size portions with salad, rice, and flatbread. Delicious. nnThe service is fast and super friendly. There isnt a long wait for your food to come out and its always solid. I cant remember going to Zoes and thinking that it was ever different. nnPrices are reasonable and the dining area seems pretty spacious. They even have outdoor seating. There are a lot of intriguing menu items that I have yet to try, but dont worry Ill be back. And if I dont end up getting some variety of the kabobs Ill try something else. A"
1,"It was my first experience going to a salon close by to where we lived, since our move from North Phoenix. I went over to this salon trusting the raving reviews about them and I am so glad I did. Not only is Noah an excellent hair stylist, he is very personable and didnt pressure me at all on purchasing products. He shows that he truly cares about the happiness of his clients. I am in love with my hair! I felt very relaxed and comfortable at VOLR. I loved the ambiance of the salon and the other staff were also friendly! For the level of customer service I received, the price was well worth it.  I am definitely going back!"
1,"Matts new location is bigger, but they have preserved the ambiance that makes Matts a breakfast destination.  It doesnt matter how big they make the diner there will always be a line to get in there!  The simple secret is the fresh, real ingredients they use, locallysourced whenever possible.  When youre a regular, they know your name and your order.  Big plus, in my book, is the new digs have a bike rack.  LOVE Matts Big Breakfast!  It truly is as good as it gets."
1,"I am in love with OTF! Its seriously the best workout you can get in an hour. I love how it just flys by. Its similar to circuit training, but you wear a heart monitor and your heart rate is displayed on a screen. It helps to push me a little bit harder so I stay in the orange zone longer. The staff is also super friendly and very responsive. I highly recommend checking out Orange Theory Fitness! They offer a free trial class as well."
1,"We had a lot of fun on this course.  We played the South course.  Pretty good price, course was in good shape, nice cart people, beer cart girls, and rangers.  Another plus is the food was really good back in the clubhouse when we finished."
1,"I dont get why this place isnt more popular.  The service is friendly if occasionally slow.  The martinis are good and the menu is wonderful. Not typical Italian but very authentic.  Heavily seafood focused but we have never had a bad meal here.  We normally go for dinner but a couple of shared plates for lunch, smaller portions, makes for a great date lunch."
1,"I have my own beliefs but am very curious and opened minded to other religions, and when I learned that the new Mormon Temple in Gilbert will be having opened tours for free to public from the middle of January to the middle of February, I knew I wanted to check it out. So I went to the web site and looked up tickets, spots where filling up fast, wound up getting  for Friday the st at am, so I booked it and printed them out.nnFriday came and off we went, when you print out the tickets  it lets you know to dress in your Sunday best yes I changed before I went to work later that day,  that once you arrive you will watch a  min video before your tour and  where to park, you should pay attention to the parking, the main parking lot fills up fast.nnWe were early but they took us right away, went into the visitor center gym area and was shown a seat, waited a few minutes for the room to fill up, then watched a  minute video which explained the reasons for the temples, and how the Mormons came to be, then we were told to wait for a usher to show us the way out. nnIt was like standing in line for a Disneyland ride, we followed the rest of the people up to the temple, before going in the sisters placed paper booties over our shoes, guess to keep things dirt free, and I dont blame them. Im not going to go play by play on the tour, but it was the most quietest tour I have ever been on, on this tour from room to room you get to read signs, and keep your questions at the end. While inside the temple, we did not go through the entire building, but did get to see quite a bit, the baptismal room, sealing room, the celestial room, changing rooms, upstairs, down stairs, around hallways, all while being completely quiet with  to  other people.nnThe Celestial room is bright, white and has an amazing crystal chandelier hanging in the center of room, long tall stain glass windows, white carpet, smaller replicas of the huge chandleries, this is the room one can feel closer to God, so I am now  sure God loves Bling, dont worry big guy so do I  , the only thing that stood out to me was the blue flowered sofas that look like they were from the s. And one other thing about the temple, the marble it was the flooring, molding, and counter tops.  This Temple, as a building is nicely done, its very beautiful and on the outside looks huge, but during the tour, what I saw was a bunch of little roomsoffices, space not fully maximized, at least by my thoughts.nnHad a great time touring the Temple and seeing how lush it is, at the end of it, whatever questions I had I let them go and just headed off to the car, it was a once in a lifetime experience for me, thank you Gilbert LDS Temple for giving me the chance to see your beautiful building before its blessed and the public no longer able to see it."
1,"Bowling, beer and barbecue... What more could you want in life. TEN Park Lanes delivers on all counts. nnBowled the night away at Monday Retro Night.  cover charge per person and . games from pmam. The lanes are nice and well kept. I love how the bowling balls are actually organized by weight. It makes it really easy to find the right one. We grabbed our balls LOL, a beer from the bar and headed to the lane.nnThe bowling and beer were great, but the star of the evening was the food! We ordered the mason jar of que. Burnt ends, mac  cheese and smoked jalapenos served in a mason jar. The burnt ends were awesome. Perfectly tender meat with a smoky flavor. The mac  cheese was nice and creamy and the smoked jalapenos added a nice kick. They brought out a variety of sauces to douse the que with. My favorite was the jalapeno coffee. I would shamelessly just drink that sauce! Seriously, who thinks of that combo! Whoever created it is a stud! Amazing stuff!"
1,"Healthcare in Vegas.  words that can make any of us from all walks of life cringe. For the most part Vegas healthcare has some issues. But there are exceptions to the problems, and for me Procare is one of them. nnYes, there can be a wait. Yes, you have to fill out insurance forms and they have to ask questions and collect a copay. Suck it up buttercup, its how heathcare these days is. Once you get the front office satisfied I havent had to wait too long, I prepare though by making sure my phone is charged or by bringing an iPad to keep me distracted while I wait. nnIve seen the nurse practictioners like Adriana, and Ive seen Dr. Tran. I like them both. If you are looking for a mindless doctor or nurse to rubber stamp your request for a trip through the best of Big Pharmas meds, this is NOT the place you want to go. But if you want to talk to people that seem to actually give a damn as to whats going on with you and want to make you well vs. seeing you as another Lexus payment...this is a place to consider. nnLocation Right off the  at Rainbow. Parking can be...interesting. The waiting room feels a touch on the cozy side. These are things that I usually grumble about but the care Ive received makes me gladly put up with it. And yes the front office staff has to ask you questions and collect money, but Ive found them friendly and good to work with on referrals or if I had questions. nn Stars. Im being tight on  stars these days. But make no mistake, its a strong  Star rating. nnOther VERY GOOD THINGS about Procare They dont have Bankers hours..so you can be seen after work and not burn sick time. And they are open on weekends too while other doctors office have crickets chirping. Health care issues dont always happen between  am and  pm, its nice to see a practice that understands how the world works and has real hours that make sense."
1,"Most Target stores, usually run the same. Great Guess Service, keeping the lines down as much as they can, cleanliness, etc. No Starbucks kind of sucks though. They need to work on asking the guess, if they need anything. I passed by employees and other people and the employees dont say anything! Work on this Ahwatukee Target but I still love shopping here!"
1,A brilliant concept! Fresh tasty food and drinks and a yummy looking pastry bar all while you get the best car wash of your cars life! The wait for the car wash was well worth it and I happily passed the time while having a delicious lunch crap cakes on mixed greens and browsing the stores cute little market section. I just moved to the neighborhood and this will be my regular spot!
1,"After a long afternoon lying by the pool, hungry, looking for happy hour deals, we found Hiro Sushi in N. Scottsdale.  No happy hour here, but they offer high quality Japanese food at an affordable price. My favorite was the tempura dish. It was perfectly fried and so crispy.  You can taste that they used clean oil to fry, not like other restaurants.  The sushi rolls were very fresh and well prepared. This is my new favorite Japanese restaurant in N. Scottsdale."
1,"So, they have cheese curds on the breakfast menu. I think that is really all I need to say.   nnBut really, the cheese curds are amazing, as is everything else Ive eaten for brunch there.  Ive gone the sweet route and the savory route and never been disappointed.  My favorite part is the list of local providers on the back. I love knowing that Graze supports Wisconsin farmers and food producers.  Check it out. You wont be disappointed!"
1,"I used to swear by Buffalo Wild Wings, until my girlfriend introduced me to Wing Stop.  While they might have less of a selection when it comes to flavors of wings dont hold that against them.  The Wings are awesome, I have tried BWW a few times since eating at Wing stop and they just dont compare."
1,"Ok, so I know this is a chain, and well what can be so special about a chain... Well I will tell you.  The turkey burger!  Thats what can be so special about a chain.  Seriously, the BEST turkey burger Ive ever had is at Red Robin and trust me, Ive had MANY.  If theres a turkey burger on the menu, you can rest assured I will order it, and time and time again, Red Robin is my favorite.  I feel a little ashamed admitting this, since, it is a chain after all.nnBut seriously, its so moist and delicious.  No one else can get it right.  Its either tasty and dry or moist and flavorless, but NOT Red Robin.  Its consistently TASTY and MOIST!  Yes, thats right.  MOIST.  Should I have given a warning at the beginning of this review that it would be R rated?nnAnyway, if you love turkey burgers as much as I do, get yourself over to a Red Robin pronto, youre welcome. p.s. get it with cheese, duhnnp.p.s. the reason I knocked it down  star is because  its very much a family restaurant, which means its inevitably loud, and   although they have great cocktails like spiked strawberry lemonade, the drinks are kinda pricey considering the lack of sufficient booze to drown out the loudness of the surroundings."
1,"We had a bb sized hole in the main water line to our house and needed it fixed immediately. Our leak had managed to flood the neighborhood transformer and APS had the power shut off to multiple residents and would not turn it back on until we got the leak fixed. After contacting AZ Leakfinders terrible experience we called Hansens and they literally saved the day. Edward was at our house, diagnosed the problem, and offered several options to get the problem rectified within a few hours. Edward was professional, polite, and very knowledgeable. Most importantly, my wife and I never felt we were being taken advantage of and walked away from the experience with nothing but good things to say. I would not hesitate for a second recommending Hansens. Theyre my new plumber for anything in the future, without a doubt."
1,"Been coming here for years, first the Trop location, now the Sahara location. Its my fave place in Vegas for Italian. I highly recommend the pesto gnocchi yummo! Heaven in your mouth. nnWe usually dine here on Friday nights, and the bar is always hopping. Weve had the calamari, antipasti platters, gnocchi, pizza, ravioli, rigatoni and Im sure weve tried more but its escaping me at the moment. We always drink a bottle of Bolla Chianti  nice and simple!nnThe owner is always there, greeting diners and ensuring that everyones satisfied with their meals. After our tiramisu last night, he brought us glasses of limoncello  totally unexpected but completely appreciated.nnOh and they have a deli next door to the restaurant that sells Italian products, and they have Caputo flour. For those of you who arent familiar, Caputo flour imported from Italy is  flour that is used widely in Italy and is considered to be one of the bestif not the best flour available anywhere. I love to make my own Napoletana pizza at home and will only use Caputo flour, but its been difficult to locate it in Vegas. Until now!nnYes, I have fallen madly in love with this place and cant wait to return next week!"
1,"I came here support friend Terri R on her birthday!  Along with couple other friendsyelpers. Most part think it was all of our first time here so let the yelping begin. Lol! Honestly one of the first impressions got was had total New York vibe from first step walk into the restaurant too even the exterior design. I felt like I was going into basement or someplace dark for dinner because at times felt like needed more lighting just too read the menu. The whole service staff had the traditional white collar shirts, black tie, and black apron. Really style you see at high end steak house in New York. Too all the pictures hanging on the walls from different perspectives of the city, and the the white paper instead of tablecloth. Too daily specials written on different parts of the walls chalkboard style. If want be in New York State of mind this restaurant has the vibe.nnThe food since big party ordered few different apps so got too try the parmesan potatoes sure not the exact name, and  calamari one with hot peppers and one without. The parmesan potatoes were really good! I like the balance between the cheese and potatoes neither one dominated the other flavor wise. Nice crispy outside and hot moist inside! The presentation got give props for small cast iron skillet enough too fit six perfectly. The calamari enjoyed both of them. I enjoy spicy food so prefer the ones with the hot peppers. Spice level nothing but still like little extra something added too the depth of flavor. It nice size portion, golden crispy outside, and nice tartar sauce came as compliment dipping sauce. nnI had clam chowder too start meal. It was solid nothing too brag about but soup that order again in heart beat. My entree I ordered the fish and chips. I LOVED the batter that the fish was fried in. It was beer batter but also they used nice IPA beer. It had nice golden crispy slightly on the darker side thinking maybe the IPA just cheap beer. Yet it not heavy heavy batter still light and once break the crust the fish steaming hot and moist. The fish size in one monster piece. It covers the plate on top of bed of skinny fries. The shoe strings fries were nothing special. It lot of food. Bargain. nnMost people come here for HH. I noticed on the menu dollar oysters star of the show but other things on the HH menu too. If look at the regular menu prices the HH might be the best route too go. I could see myself coming back for HH."
1,"If I had a store, the stuff would look like this.  Oh that reminds me, I had a store and the stuff did look like this, or as close as I could come to it, with the swap meets and garage sales at my disposal.nMy friends are kind of art meets third world culture kind of people, so the store merchandise reminds me of home.  Home goods elevated to art, with a world culture philosophy thrown in suit my taste.nI beat my way through Caesers Palace, at one point GPSing my way toward the strip to find this store, which was rumored to be here.  When I finally made it to the green wall of living succulents, I felt I had discovered a new world...or just the best stuff in the world.nThe eclectic mix of pattern and design make the goods here sing.  On a recent visit, I found an inlaid turtle belt, and some wavy edged turquoise plates and bowls from Thailand, along with turquoise drinking glasses wiith small sunflower patterns.  nI shop any Anthropology store I can find, but love the Vegas store for its breath of green on the Strip, its huge sales closet, and its fun staff."
1,"Awesome Bar food..best Ive ever had..u must try the Popper Burger..it has cream cheese and crispy breaded onions..ask for the jalapeno sauce..its bomb.  They have great beer..favorites are their hefe, kiltlifter  ipa"
1,This place is really awesome I would really recommend to you guys Ms Danette she is a very good esthetician she will really give what your skin needs and have a very relaxing touch...I will surely come back here next time... Thank you so much Ms Danette. I love the ambiance here very relaxing...
1,I havent enjoyed a dinner like this in a while. We each ordered separate flights of wine and created our own wine tasting. They have many great wines to choose from. Both the food and service were fantastic. nnOh and its a great singles hot spot for anyone in their s  s
1,"I am actually very fond of this place.nMy best friend and I come in to dine as often as we can.nnBJs definitely has that very loud and social environment. We were seated very quickly and the first thing I noticed on the menu was definitely that half of it was about alcohol. I was not looking there so I cannot review on that part! Haha. There menu is quite extensive with a wide variety so anyone will find something they are looking for.nnWe started off with mozzarella sticks which very great but I wish they would include more dipping sauce. We decided to split a classic angus burger which turned out fantastic and it was very juicy. We also opted for the thin sliced fries and they were crunchy and fantastic.nnOur drinks were refilled very quickly since she gave them a little hint by putting her empty glass near the edge of the table. Our server was very nice and kept coming back to check up on us.nnThe dessert! Order the pizookie xD They are AMAZING!nnOne of the times I went with my boyfriend, I ordered the fettuccine alfredo and that came out positively delightful. I could not finish it so I had to ask for a togo box, haha. He had the miso salmon which tasted amazing but he did wish there was more rice for it. nnThis place will definitely stay in my favorites."
1,"I just moved into the Gainey Ranch area and have been checking out my surroundings.  I was having a hankering for some BBQ so I Yelped it and found Lucilles.  I am very glad I went.  The service was prompt and very polite the space was large, clean and appropriate the menu is huge and most importantly the food was excellent.  I will definitely be going back!!"
1,"very good singers and dancers that make you happy to relive the s , they play the songs perfect into their skits. high energy, they even give you a  minute Whizz break in the middle of the show which was quite funny, also had servers selling beer seat to seat pretty awesome"
1,"I LOVE THIS PLACE.  I started doing Bikram Yoga in  and had tried Sumits a couple of times before  now that I live in the area I did the day challenge in Dec and got super hooked...the instructors are phenomenal Kim, Julie, Jordan, and Gina are my favs and they offer variety you can take the  min. Sumits Yoga and they also offer hourlong flow classes for the more traditional yogi or yogini...i got to practice a few things I had never tried before and in the hot room your body is all limbered up!  Come join me, I am committed for the next  months at least!"
1,"After our last trip and sampling VosgesHaut Chocolate at Caesars Palace, I thought it was impossible to find yet another chocolatier with equal or better chocolates. I was wrong. While VosgesHaut features exotic flavored chocolates, Chocolat was simple and to the point. Hubby and I tried the dark chocolate named The flavored with Earl Grey tea and the dark sugar free truffle. OMG they were both to die for. The one flavored with tea was like a ganache, rich and simply indulgent. The truffle was also very very good.nnI will definitely come back again and get more chocolates next time were in Vegas. Salesperson was also very very pleasant."
1,"I dont know how this location does it! They are constantly PACKED and the wait for the genius bar is always Minutes. Somehow, they always manage to squeeze me in and help me with my device within the hour. I normally go hungry so I can stop by CPK next door  while I wait. nnThis location is at the Fashion Show mall, so I recommend parking at the Saks and then heading directly to the left when you reach the mall opening because it is a very short walk from here and on the same level. nnMy Apple Iphone from Sprint SUCKS! I was very happy with my S, but for some reason my service all over the country I travel often is horrible! It drops calls and sometimes takes  minutes just to load a map or web page. After a  month battle with SprintApple with no one wanting to take fault, I finally told the tech at this store I demand a replacement  just so I can see if it is the phone or the service. Guess What??? It is Sprint. The new  SUCKS just as hard as my old !! nnMoral of the Yelp I still have faith in the Apple brand, I am a lifelong Macintosh user and not one of those that jumped on only after the Ipod release and recently I had been losing faith in the brand because of my constant phone issues. This tech successfully reupped my faith in the Apple brand and helped me identify the real problem SPRINT!"
1,"I recently found myself facing a birthday milestone of sorts, so like any levelheaded person, I chose escapism to avoid any office brouhahas and offkey singing. By pure happenstance, I wound up at this InterContinental it was part of an Expedia package, but let me tell you  it was a week of pure heaven. First of all, youre just steps from Old Town, so surrounded by breathtaking architecture. Its conveniently Metroadjacent, flawlessly decorated, and staffed with serviceoriented professionals who spoil you rotten. I literally wanted to have my bed, park view, and luxurious bathroom shipped home with me. While this hotel stay was not of my choosing when I booked my trip, you can rest assured Ill now be purposely staying at this chain again and again."
1,"I got to shoot a  Cal ! nnDid you hear me ? nnNo ? nnOf course you cant hear me because I just shot a  Cal !   Everyone else stopped shooting and watched me.nnSeriously though I had an awesome amazing experience and had a great instructor.  Im not a gun owner, but getting to shoot those guns in the SWAT package was AWESOME ! nnCue musicnnnananananananannOn side note  Id skip shooting a shot gun if Ive never done it before, and I was you ... shoulder was a bit sore even with instructor bracing me, and Im not a little dude."
1,"Go at off peak hours or else be prepared to wait...and wait...and sometimes give up waiting and go somewhere else. But if youre lucky enough to snag one of the  seats at the counter, you wont be disappointed. nnPan roast is the most popular item, its rich and creamy base of either seafood or sausage or a combo of all. I would recommend just seafood or add sausage, the have the Palace Pan Roast which comes with chicken but that adds nothing to the dish. They do give you very large meaty shrimps if you order the ones that comes with it. The side of rice they give you is the perfect vessal to soak up all the yummy goodness. nnThe oysters are reasonably priced, very meaty. The horseradish sauce has a nice kick.nnChowders are also very good, tons of seafood and clams.nnI like the ciopino too, again tons of seafood and large juicy shrimp.nnThis is  not  stars because depending on whose cooking, sometimes the dishes arent as good. My last visit here I think they were switching shifts and the new guy started our  dishes, then ran around looking for something, left our food to cookburn on the cookers and left and the other guy had to quickly finish it off. They tasted OK but I know it could have been better if our chef had cooked our food correctly. And for the ladies, make sure you bring a jacket because the location is right under an air vent and its always freezing at the bar."
1,"I cant believe the average rating isnt higher for this place. My only real complaint about it is that its so far away, especially now that they closed their other location. I got hooked on contemporary Indian food not too long ago, and Bombay Spice does it well."
1,"After taking my dog to  different places for grooming I decided that I was not going to find a place where I can trust the service that was offered for my best friend.  Finally I decided to give one last chance and try this place.nnNeedless to say I was very happy with with the staff unfortunately I dont remember the Russian accent lady that helped us but she was amazing, the groomer did an outstanding job.nnTo finalize my review if you like to spoil your friend while visiting vegas.  This is the place where you will have piece of mind that your pet will have as much fun as you would.nnDefinitely coming back"
1,"Great park with a lot to offer. A splash pad   playgrounds for the kids. A basketball court and plenty of shaded eating areas to entertain with. A quaint little cactus garden to see plants  animals. The park is always well lit and maintained. WATCH OUT, for folks on their bikes. Most people are considerate but some can be douchebags who race through the park, like theyre lance Armstrong. Other than that this is a great park the whole family can enjoy."
1,As buffets go bacchanal would be hard to beat. The food was good and of course plentiful. I especially liked the cheese station. Deserts were good. nnThe biggest downside is the eternal wait to get in.
1,Bottom line  the tacos are awesome. Those that are giving this place a bad review are hating on the furniture its a holeinwall where you pay taco  what do you expect?? and it not being authentic we were the only white peeps in here so.... We had both the spicy pulled pork and the carne asada. A few pointersn There are a few different lines for a few different things  dont be afraid to ask someone who works there. n Lunchbrunch time on Sat or Sun is suicide...come either late night or on an offmeal time. nnI wish this place was near my house.
1,"I decided to check this place out since it is close to my home.  I was not expecting much as far as the food and decided to give it a try anyway.  I asked the bartender what was good and he said everything so I decided to try the Tijuana Turky sandwich and the fried cheese.  My friend had the wings awesome.  nnI was happy to say that the food was really good.  Everything I tried.  Definatelty better than expected.  Anyway, being an outgoing person I told the bartender that I had read a couple of reviews indicating the food was horrible.  They did not know about Yelp, but they did say that the first three months they were open presented a lot of challenges with the staffing and consistency of the product coming from kitchen.  Anyway, they said they have a good chef and even better leader in place for the past couple of months and there has been a noticicable improvement.  They asked me to please post again and ask for people to give them another chance because things are definately going strong.  Not to mention they do some prett good specials for North Scottsdale.nnAnyway, the staff was really nice to me and my friends and I think it is has a really nice vibe and the food was really good.  I will be back and luckly I dont have to give this a second chance as they exceeded my expectations.  I would suggest everyone check this place out."
1,"This is the private club inside House of Blues at Mandalay Bay.  The duecor and ambiance in this restaurant are top notch.  When you add in the view from the balcony, this is the most visually spectacular restaurant in Las Vegas...nothing else even close.  The service is also outstanding and if you are an actually member of this private club I was a guest, prepare to receive very personalized service.    You will feel like a rock star whether youre eating, drinking or just smoking a cigar yes, they sell them to smoke on the outdoor balcony at this awesome restaurant.  The food is also really good, but not as stand out as the ambiance and service.  It is an expensive place, but if youre a member, youll receive a  discount...but its still expensive.  I had the lamb shank which was delivered without any room for improvement.  Our table also had sides of creamy spinach, macaroni and cheese, and risotto.  All the sides were delicious.  My wife had the pork chop, which she thought was a little dry and over cooked, but still flavorful.  The members we went had the pork chop which he also thought was dry, but flavorful and the horseradish crusted tenderloin which she thought was slightly overcooked.  Overall, the food was really good, but there is room for improvement.  Food stars, Ambiance stars, Value stars, Service.  I know my average is not really  stars, but Im giving the Foundation Room  stars because the ambiance, patio view and service were unsurpassed."
1,"Reminds me a little bit of Mels Dinner from the old tv show Alice.  Kinda of small inside and had the sweaty kitchen staff in back. It has a s theme to it, which gave us plenty to look at while we waited for our meal.nnWe were seated right away and served drinks promptly as well. The waitress was very helpful in describing our meal choices and we never felt that we were an inconvenience to her.nnThe food came in very large quantities which was a pleasant surprise. Two burgers and fries was enough to fill up the two large individuals. Not the cheapest place to eat but when you consider portion size, it seems to be a fair deal.nnOverall a nice experience and will go again."
1,"We got seated by our host and the first thing that I recognized was that we were sitting at Burt Reynolds table. As I looked around, all the other tables were marked with famous actors names. Whenever a certain actor comes into the restaurant to eat, they get to eat at their table. Its pretty neat. Clint Eastwoods table was right across from ours, so I went over there and sat down. It sounds weird, but it was kind of cool to be sitting at Clint Eastwoods table and where he had sat and dined.nnThe restaurant has an old fashioned feel to it. It has wood paneling and the lights are dimmed down with Sinatra playing in the background. All the staff were wearing tuxedos. Dont worry though, I ate in tshirt and shorts. I felt a little out of place.nnThe first thing that really impressed me was that when we ordered their famous Caesar salad, the waiter mixed the dressing and lettuce right in front of us. It was one of the best salads that Ive had in a long time.nnIf you love prime rib, this is the place to go! The Golden Steer is famous for it and they do not disappoint. When I cut through the steak, it felt like butter. The steak was cooked perfectly and I can say without a doubt, that it was the best prime rib that Ive ever had.nnCoupled with the history and the outstanding food, I cant think of better dining experiences. Every time someone asks me for a dining suggestion in Vegas, I always mention this restaurant. It is a little out of the way, but it is the perfect getaway to the hustle and bustle of the strip."

1,"Troy has been grooming my pack of  for years and ALWAYS does an amazing job.  I dont know how they get to be so raggedy looking, but as bad as they get, Troy consistently drops off a pack that looks like they could each enter a dog show.nYep, I said drops off and thats just half of the cool thing about A Family Affair Pet Grooming.  He also picks up!  How cool is that?  I dont have to worry about loading everyone into the car and driving them down the street anymore.  Troy picks the dogs up and drops them back off at the house when hes finished!nGotta love a company that recognizes and caters to a busy lifestyle.nHes great with dogs, too  even Scout that HATES ALL GROOMERS.  Hes patient, friendly and the dogs like him a lot!"
1,"Chopstix is the best delivery chinese in town the food is great.  The menu is globally pretty good, but I always end up ordering the mongolian beef, house fried rice and pan fried dumplings.  I called to order lunch once and they were busy, so they offered to call me back rather than keep me on hold.  Great touch."
1,"I heard that there are only two good Breakfast places in phoenix Over Easy and Matts Big Breakfast.  I am a big fan of quality breakfast and am pretty picky about them.  This Over Easy location stops seating at about am.  Frankly, I think thats ridiculously early so i Inquired as to why.  I was told that they would stay open later, but as a part of their lease they have to close early because they share a parking lot with the neighbors.  Their Scottsdale location stays open later and the menu is exactly the same.  nnWe got there around  on Saturday.  The wait for a table for  was about  min. They have a pot of coffee out, with a sign that says help yourself to coffee while you wait, we will be happy to add it to your check.  Listen up.  If i am waiting to eat at your place, you can at least give me the coffee for free while i wait.  If im drinking coffee BEFORE i sit down.  There is a damn good chance that i will order a cup when i get to the table, just charge me for it then.  I was peeved by this.  Its coffee for gods sake.  nnOnce we got our table, one of us ordered the Pecan Banana French Toast, the other got an Omelet.  The food was good, arrived quickly and the chef came around to several tables to see how everything was.  nnContrary to what others said, the portions were average and were what we expected.  The service wasnt bad either.  The place was pretty crowded and they still managed to keep my coffee cup full and the food came out quickly.  nnI dont think there is really anything spectacular about this joint, the food was good, the menu was standard.  But its pretty good and well probably come back."
1,"This is just a review of their Wilton cake decorating classes. Ive had Kim and Daci as instructors and they are both quite wonderful. The class was a lot of fun and the time flew by really quickly. One thing they dont mention is that it does take some prep time to get the icing, cake, etc ready before class so if you dont have any spare time then dont do it. You do have to buy a lot of supplies, but a lot of the supplies you buy you will be using for the rest of your life. Wilton has amazing products and luckily Michaels always has great coupons. It was getting a bit hard for me to lug things back and forth being  months preggo at the time, but it was definitely a fun time. You get to meet a lot of amazing people too.  I know I will be using the things that Ive learned in class to make awesome cakes and treats!nnAs far as the store itself goes, there is always limited customer service, but its worth the wait especially if you have a coupon!"
1,"Ok...whats so unique about this place?nIf you are a big fan of micro breweries and like big freakin tanks carry the beer then you may like the place even more.nnIts quite spacious, somewhat expensive, gives feel of a normal bar except for the fact that they you can see big distillation tanks. nIt looks like the place was made out of the unused space from the brewery based on the fact that its not quite symmetrical who cares.nGood variety of beers and food."
1,"Their afternoon tea is divine. The view of the castle isnt half bad either! I always take visiting friends here. Its also great for those rainy days wandering around the museum. nnI love the seasonal selection of foods with afternoon tea at the Tower. The special RAF blend tea is amazing  and can be purchased for a good cause donations to support the RAF. nnThe tea is very filling, selection is always delicious, and the service is impeccable. Love."
1,"First time visiting the casino and I fell in love with the place.. Very clean, classy, had some good modern tunes rocking through out the place especially when Muse came on.. that was the point I knew I was in the right place lol.. friendly staff all over the place from the cocktail waitresses, slot attendants, security.. everyone seemed to be happy.. beautiful location off the strip and worth visiting.. easily  of my top  casinos in the country now.. Stations delivers again a great casino!"
1,"We dropped by for a late lunch and sat at the bar. You choose what size pizza you want, then the sauce and the last the toppings.  We got two personal pizzas, one with their tomato sauce and pepperoni and mushrooms and another one with pesto sauce and grilled chicken and mushrooms. The tomato sauce pizza was very good, much better than the pesto sauce pizza.  The tomato sauce was tasty with the herbs and spices they use.  The pesto sauce was decent.  The personal size pizza was very generous in size and I only ate  of it.  We also got a house salad which was your typical salad.  nnOur server was the bartender whose name I think was Todd.  He explained the menu to us as this was our first time. He was very helpful and personable."
1,"I love watching Bobby Flay on Food Network, so my friends and I had to try Mesa Grill when I went to Vegas. Customer service was awesome, and we were seated in a corner booth. nnAppetizernWe were first served with a basket of warm baked goods  savory muffins, sweet biscuits, etc., which was a very nice touch. We shared the rough cut tuna nachos , and it was very light and refreshing. The portion was small though, so not really good for sharing among a group of . nnMain entreenOrdered the Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich with Southwestern Fries  grilled red onion, Argula ancho chile mayonnaise  DELICIOUS! The pork was thick, juicy, flavorful and tender. The mayonnaise really brought together the entire sandwich, and the fries were so good that my friends ordered another side dish of it. Definitely recommend this sandwich. nnOne of us also ordered the Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash , which he liked very very much."
1,"Im a huge movie buff.  Huuuuge.nn or  years ago, I walked into Movies on Central looking for something or other.  I didnt find it, but liked the place all the same.  Good selection.  Actually, probably a better selection than anywhere else in town.  But seeing as I lived in Ahwatukee at the time, I didnt have much cause to make the trek.  Besides, Netflix had everything I needed.nnNow that I live much closer and MoC that abbreviation is probably annoying, but Im tired is more or less on my way home from work, I can stop in easily.  So I did last night, in search of a film called Dementia .  I called ahead to verify they had it and hopped in my car.  Central Ave is still a big pain in the ass thanks to light rail construction, but I got there with little trouble.  I dont have much more to say other than the selection is still great, the guy who helped me sign up was really friendly, and Ill probably be back.  I still have Netflix, but I look forward to MoC satisfying my appetite for instant gratification."
1,"Well I joined this gym last year and Im a different person now. Great atmosphere, friendly people and best coaches. You have everything you need to become a fighter. Awesome schedule and perfect training times. Not expensive, although it should be the most expensive, because its the best in the area in my opinion. There are a lot of other stuff, check it out is my advice."
1,First off have to say that our waiter Eric B. was awesome.  Weve been there twice and each time he was kind and courteous.  And as for the food it was wonderful as well. Had the poached eggs this time and I cant wait to go back.
1,"I am not sure why there are two listings for this IKEA.nnThis is a good location, it is just like every other IKEA you have been to. nnThere isnt a lot that I can say that has not been said, so I will give you my IKEA secrets.nnGo to httpIKEA.com and sign up for the family card to get discounts. You get free coffee and a free ice cream cone with this as well.nnYou can look up products online ahead of time and get their aisle and bin number before you leave, print that out if you want to skip the showroom.nnYou can also see what is in stock online at your locale IKEA. This helps incase you are looking for something specific.nnWear comfortable shoes!nnEmpty your car out and measure where you have room or plan to tie stuff to the top if you are going to buy anything large. nnPlan to be here ALL DAY!nnPlan to get ideas and take pictures perhaps.nnIf you have kids, they will enjoy the kids center where you can check them in, get a pager and they are allowed to play in there for an hour.  The pager will buzz if your kid needs you back sooner.nnWhen you start the showroom, grab a few big yellow bags.nnWalk the show room  it takes about an hour to do the whole thing without a lot of stopping, make sure to pick up anything you see that you want from the bins, you might not be able to find it again in the maze.nnBreak for lunch! At the end of the showroom is a cafeteria, swedish coffee is great, I love the LOX and they usually have some good sweets.nnThen you will go downstairs and actually start shopping. nnThe marketplace is about another hour and then you go into the warehouse where you get the larger stuff. nnIf you are getting any larger stuff, make sure to grab a pallet cart.. you will  need it. Stuff is boxed and heavy.nnIf you buy anything that might have extra pieces, make sure you confirm what you need. A bed may have top bottom, slats, midbeam and hardware all in different bins. You dont want to get home and realize you are missing a piece.nnIf its not there when you look, ASK. They will check the back for you.nnWant a deal  look in the AS IS section.. lots of good stuff there for discounted prices and usually someone else has already put it together for you.nnIf you have a lot of smaller stuff,  grab some blue bags as you check out. They are . cents each, but unless you want to carry a bunch of little items out..  they come in handy and are really reusable. I always have a couple in my car.nnYou will buy something you dont  need. Its a given. But have fun and plan to leave tired!"
1,This is a fun place to check out...they have sooo many MMs to choose from and you can personalize them if you like. I sure did...I got me the Las Vegas designs...lol. nnFun to browse everything they have to offer and you can check out a mini show too. nnLove MMs!
1,"I was in Vegas a couple of weeks ago and had dinner at STK. I booked a reservation about two weeks in advance for a Tuesday night and all they had left was a  PM, so I would definitely suggest booking ahead of time though they do accept walkins if you want to take a chance or wait. All of the food was delicious and came out really quick. I ordered the filet as my entruee and while it wasnt the best Ive ever had, it was very good. As it got later and the restaurant began to fill up, the music got louder, which added to the atmosphere. Our waiter was good but I wish he were a little friendlier. It was a bit expensive but on par with other steakhouses and restaurants in Las Vegas. Overall, I would recommend!"
1,"Great date placennAwesome jazzblueslounge live music.nnFood is fannnnnnnnntasticnnI had the gnocchi with gorgonzola sauce, and the chocolate mousse dessert.... mmmmmmmnnId certainly go here first and foremost if I wanted to hear some good chill live music."
1,"We enjoy lunches here. The tilapia is good but the broccoli is usually under cooked. Today.... well, its a holiday! so forget the healthy stuff nnI had a fried cheese and bacon burger! OMG.... I should say it slowly... F R I E D CHEEEESEEE  BaCoN burger. I didnt want to do it but I was talking to the waitress who was VERY friendly and telling her my love of burgers, she recommended it to me and the sweet Tea which was peach and had a good healthy amount of vodka in it. DELISH.nnThe burger was better than I had hoped it was moist, dripping creamy fried cheese with nice thick sliced bacon and shoe string fries on the side with ranch dressing. nnYou no longer throw peanuts on the floor they have lil buckets at the tables for that and THAT makes me very happy. never was a fan of walking on peanuts... sounds like egg shells. nnI have been here several times and it was over due for a review and this one needs to go on my love of burgers page."
1,this place is amazing every time i go i request for the server FREDDIE He is the best! the food is amazing. i get the number . extra large ! but also the chicken  teriyaki is very good along with the deep fried wings. the thai tea and the fresh young coconut! this place is a must!!! i go at least  times a week the prices are great . for an extra large! cant beat that
1,Valentina is a miracle worker!  n     My wedding gown alterations were originally done elsewhere.  Long story short.... She jacked up my dress and charged me a fortune to do so. I frantically called Valentina  weeks before my wedding and she told me she would do what she can. I brought the gown to her the next day and she confirmed that it did not fit me properly at all. n     She worked wonders on that gown!  I picked it up the day before the wedding and it fit like a glove. And her price was very reasonable. How I only wish she had done the alterations in the first place. Would have saved me a ton of money.... And tears. n     Thank you Valentina!!!
1,"Canes is a good place to get lunch with friends and hang out. I almost always order a Caniac   pcs of chicken, toast, fries, slaw, and sauce I replace the slaw with toast because the fries are plenty for me and I dont like their slaw. After eating the whole box of food, Im pretty stuffed. Its a bit pricey for chicken fingers, but I think its worth it.nnThis location is usually pretty packed around lunch time, so be warned. nTheres something about their caniac sauce and toast that makes me come back for more."
1,"After driving by this place a thousand times we finally ate here! They had a Groupon deal so that helped get us there us faster.  It was a a great find. I read on the website and learned of the powerhouse  team that is running the restaurant so I wasnt surprised it was really nice. We loved the small intimate feel of the place. The host had a thick Italian accent which I really enjoyed. Especially being in an Italian restaurant. nnPROS nCaesars Salad  looks plain in the pictures but the dressing they make from scratch is on point.nnEggplant alla Parmigiana HUGE portion. The eggplant was thin and breaded stacked on top of each other  or  layers then homemade mozzarella melted with sauce on top. If I could change one thing I would ask for a little more sauce on the eggplant.nnChicken Sorrento Chicken breast with eggplant and mozzarella with sauce. Tender chicken, large portion. nnPasta comes with the entreesnnItalian host  his accentnnPasta is hand made on the premises. Desserts are all home made too. All Italian desserts!nnnCONSnOnly open for dinnernnnThere was a tv set in the upper corner of the room but muted. A cooking show was on at pm Friday night. I didnt understand why that was there or even turned on. But I wasnt facing the tv and it didnt bother me. It just seemed out of place for the atmosphere the restaurant aired. Make reservations on the weekend. It was crowded around  Friday night."
1,"I had lunch here today with some coworkers. None of us had been before and we were all pleasantly suprised. It was a beautiful day to sit on the patio, which is really nice.  I had the habenero broccoli soup to start and it was amazing.  Then I had the bfb sandwich with their house made chips. The sandwich was good,  though the jam on it was really heavy on the ginger.. just not my thing,  not a knock on their food. The chips were good but not as good as some places Ive been.  A few tables got the tater top app and it looked amazing.  I would also like to try the deviled eggs next time.  Last, the beer list looked amazing and I want to go back again when I can actually have one!"
1,"This place is a step up from fast food Chinese food. It is pretty good for a quick bite to eat. The only entree I ever order is the Mongolian Beef. You can also see the kitchen from the dining area, I like that. The place appears to be clean."
1,Neat place where you can see and buy a lot of hard to find elsewhere things. Some modern and some will bring back memories with thoughts in your head of  I dint think they still made that anymore.nnIf you are near do stop in. You will have fun looking around and you just might buy something as well.
1,"I recently switched health insurance companies to coverage under Health Plan of Nevada HMO plan which pretty much limits me to Southwest Medical Associates SMA clinics.  Hearing horror stories about the care received at the clinics around town about poor beside manner and long wait times, I was very apprehensive about my visit to Next Door Health.  I got there about  minutes before my appointment time and a medical assistant was out to greet me in about  minutes?  She was efficient and seemed to know what to do to get me prepped for the PA.nnIn comes my PA Kim.  She was all smiles, warm and friendly  definitely not at all what I was expecting from SMA.  We discussed my problem and the most refreshing part was she educated me about what to expect with my treatment.  Usually at a doctors visit, I get some medications written up and pretty much get thrown out the door after I have waited an hour.nnConclusion  Great experience.  Will definitely come back for any future medical visits AND Ill be seeing Kim.  p.s.  They do physicals there, too."
1,"Really good tex mex joint in South End. This place is REALLY small! Lunch time on weekdays is a challenge, so long as you dont mind saying excuse me, can you pass me a salsa cup and a straw? Its advisable to get your order to go, unless you can get a seat at one of their  tables outside. The bbq chicken quesadilla is really good. Better than Moes , better than Salsaritas."
1,"Five years later, its time to update my CLT review. Between  and today, Ive departed from or arrived at this airport over  times. Ive also gotten a couple of gate passes to escort my daughter through security.nnCLT is still a good airport for layovers. Lots of restaurant options from a fancy wine bar to a sit down burger joint, plus a full spectrum of fast food. The main atrium even has a pretty good barbecue spot if youre looking for Carolina cue and cant leave the secure zone.nnFor those departing from CLT, you can use any of the security checkpoints. Unlike some airports Newark, once youre inside Charlotte you can go to any gate. The line at A is usually pretty long, so feel free to wander up to B or C if they look shorter.nnSouthwest, United and Delta are in the A concourse. American is also there but might be moving as a result of the merger. JetBlue and Lufthansa are in D, I believe.nnTipsn Rental car franchises are not located in the terminal  you do have to catch your companys shuttle bus.n Theres not a smoking lounge inside the secure area. You have to go outside and follow the signs.n B and E checkpoints have TSA Precheck lines. Other checkpoints have elite security queues which are not specific to just US Airways. Any elite passenger is allowed to use it!n There are TWO US Airways Clubs. With US moving to the OneWorld alliance, American Airlines folks who have Admirals Club access can use these clubs.nnConsider trying Park N Go instead of Business Valet. I find their service is better and cheaper than the airports service."
1,"Love this place!!! Its has become one of my go to places. They have great choices for both food  drinks during Happy Hour. It can be louder on some days but this is a sports bar, after all, so its to be expected. I havent had a bad experience with this place. The servers are always pleasant and the service is good."
1,"Stopped by here for lunchdinner it was ...what meal does that count as? it was pretty quiet since we didnt come during regular lunchdinner hours.  Crane Alley is a Restaurant  Bar but it definitely feels more like a bar than a restaurantits very dimly lit, there are pool tables and a large bar area.  I guess if you like barsfeel comfortable in bars you probably wont notice this.nnI got the veggie sandwich and it was amazingly good.  Please allow me to list the ingredients of this most tasty of sandwiches cucumber, bell peppers, onion, tomato, sprouts, lettuce, basil oil, sunflower seeds and dill cream cheese, all on two big slices of wheat bread.  The greek pasta salad was also tasty, and overall it was a very satisfying, generous portioned meal for a little under .nnMy boyfriend had a hamburger and it was HUGE.  The fries were good and he liked the burger although he said it had some kind of seasoning on it, which he seemed kind of eh about.nnBetween the two of us we spent about  before tip and without any drinks.  Not bad.  The desserts also sounded really good flourless chocolate cake...mmm... but we passed on that this time.nnIll definitely be back.  I feel like if I had any interest in beer then this would be my new favorite place, but since Im not a fan of beer or bars in general, thats kind of a deterrent for me completely aware Im in the minority here.  Oh well.  Ill still come back for their yummy food."
1,"I got to the airport super early for my flight and I was dreading the wait. But the free wifi at McCarran was so great and the wait passed quickly. nnSecurity was relatively fast and the little tram that you take to the D Gates is really fun. nnAnd if you havent lost enough money in Vegas already, you can always play some slots while youre waiting to board."
1,"Love the Monk. Beer selection is always different and exciting. Great place to be adventurous and find a new beer! Food is consistently good, make sure you sit in Brandys section, best waitress ever! Owner is friendly. Also has many healthy options!"
1,My husband and I love this place. I think everything here is really good. The pad kee mao is very good. The Tom yum soup is very good as well although I wish they had it in a smaller portion so I could just have a cup of it as an appetizer. Also the pineapple curry with shrimp is very good. I really enjoy going here.
1,I had been wanting to try a place like this and Im so happy with this choice! Rebecca was funny and informative. The atmosphere was relaxed and welcoming. Dont be afraid if you feel like you dont have artistic ability! Its fun for all! Everyones looked so different by the end but thats what made it so fun! Gotta check this place out everyone! And dont forget to bring your own wine  made it that much more relaxing!
1,"Very good  a marrying of concepts...  I had the quiche and it was actually amazingly delicious  and Im something of a quiche snob.  Staff is very helpful  but not in your face...  Lots of bikes from bmx to cruiser  and from very modestly read low priced to high end stuff.  Parts, upgrades, expert advice...nnAll kinds of surprises  gear  books  board games  etc...  Great concept executed well.nnPlus, some of the walls are my favorite shade of green...  nnDammit.  Now Im hungry.  For quiche.  Stupid Trailhead, you should be open  hours."
1,"This place is fantastic. My wife and I came here during our  day stay. The must get for breakfast is the Cinnamon Roll. n The staff are friendly, the food comes out fast and its good! nThis is must place for breakfast while youre here."
1,"living in the UK for over  years now, i will admit New Look is somewhat of a staple for me when it comes to clothes and shoe shopping.  there used to only be one option on princes street, in the wee spilt level shop in prince street mall which was great.  but then about a year ago a massive new shiny shop opened up on the west end of princes street and it almost felt like my shopping life was complete.nnyes, New Look does have some cheap tarty items aimed toward a younger crowd than me, but its also good for staple pieces and shoes!!  i find that New Look is great for cute dresses that i can wear to work or to meet friends for lunch or a few drinks.  they also have a fantastic assortment of cardigans of all lengths and styles that are great for wearing with jeans, dresses, or leggings.nnthe best part of this New Look though has to be the shoe area.  its huge!!!  and just loads and loads of shoes to choose from.  boots, flats, heels, super high heels, any type of shoe that one will probably ever need.  best part is they are usually pretty good quality and for not loads of money.nnim also clearly a fan of the accessories!  i cant help but have a look at the necklaces and scarves when im in here and usually leave with something new and sparkly to wear soon.  this shop is definitely great and a great place to shop!  the only downfall is that the queue at the tills often takes ages to move."
1,"Katrina M. had stumbled upon this place not too long ago and was telling my other friends and I that it was the place to go. The drinks are cheap and strong. The atmosphere is fun with a large dance floor in the center and one lone gogo dancer... on a pedestal. I am not exactly sure where Charlies is going with their mixture of drag queens and gay cowboys, but Ill roll with it. I am all about the western shirts anyways. Lets not forget Katrina M.s favorite thing about the bar, the disco cowboy boots. Thats right, forget about disco balls even though it would be just as fitting, boots are much better.nnEach night has a certain theme and there were too many for my buzzed mind to wrap around. Tuesdays are drag queen bingo night starting at pm. I might just grab one of my Filipino moms and drag them along. Thursdays are all day country music and half price drinks. Line dancing lessons are provided as well. I caught that much. There are inked nights to show off your tattoos for free booze. Underwear nights for those who have an aversion to pants. nnSunday apparently is not one of the hopping nights. We came around am and it was semi busy at the bar, but barren everywhere else. The room gets smoky quickly and the ventilation is not that good. The bartenders are fun. A mixture of some sass and honest is appreciated. While one made fun of our initial hesitance to drink and our quick jump to doing shots, another was kind enough to tell us to wait a few minutes until they started their happy hour. After am, beers were .."
1,"Currently the best restaurant in Pittsburgh.nnThis place is interesting and original and the food is amazing!  Its exactly what Walnut Street, and Shadyside in general has been missing.  The menu is very diverse and creative.  I love that you can get multiple courses with the bites and small plates taste a bunch of stuff and not spend too much money. nnThe bar is a really great place to hang out with friends, and the custom drinks are awesome with lots of fresh fruit.  nnIm very very happy this has moved into my neighborhood!nnPS save room for dessert, the flourless chocolate cake is to die for!"
1,"This place is a wonderful find. Sort of out of place amongst the run down buildings that pepper that neighborhood. Great breakfasts, if a bit pricey compared to some of the a.m. joints. Decent coffee, and a nice tea selection. A cozy atmosphere, low key enough to sit a bit and read."
1,"First of all, I am not a friend nor do I know any body personally who works here. I was reading the obscure review of a previous student and thought to myself, wow that is very unnecessary. As a customer, which is all that should matter on this site, hence what yelp is for, I will say my experience here today was nice. I had lowered my expectations because this is a school and I understand that students are learning and practicing, but I came to realize they do a MUCH better job than ANY other school Ive been to in the past. My stylists name was kaylee or kylee not sure how to spell it and she was very sweet, and most importantly did a good job. She listened to me, she knew what she was doing and I certainly didnt get any bad vibes from the surroundings. Everyone seemed to be busy working on things or clients or cleaning or doing something of the sort. I have gone to the school before in the past, when it was located by fashion square and I must say this new location surely is a step up. I am impressed. I liked it a lot. My color came out better than expected and I really like the cut too ... better than my last few hair cuts that I paid too much  for. I will definitely be coming back and seeing kaylee kylee? again hopefully if she is still here. She did a great job and Im happy. Thanks Tony  Guy"
1,woooooooooooow.nnSome of the best ribs ive had in my life.nnSome of the best bbq ive ever had in my life.nnAmazing atmosphere. Down home country feel.nnFast service. nnAmazing food.nnIts UNREAL
1,"We come here almost twice a week, and love it! This morning, while running late, I asked my husband to pick up milk for our daughter. I called whole foods and Diana was kind enough to bring the milk to customer service so my husband could run in and out w our toddler. Impressed that a large chain still has customers at the heart of their business. We will continue to shop here."
1,"Everything We NeedednnReally enjoyed our stay here! We stayed Friday  Tuesday for the Rock n Roll Marathon and couldnt have been happier especially with how close it was to the starting line. Our room was clean though wish it had a fridge and had a great view of New York New York and the strip. It was easy to check in, always able to get a taxi, and I had the best luck at this casino over the others  We also really enjoyed the Excalibur buffet twice, ate at Bucca di Beppo inside the hotel and had some beers and watched the game at Octane bar next to the buffet. We also ate at the Baja Fresh that was inside and the Pizza Hut Express. I would definitely stay here again."
1,"We stumbled upon this place completely by accident D My husband and I were just taking a stroll through our neighborhood, and stumbled upon a dilapidated shopping center. There was one building that caught our eye, Naples Ristorante. When we got home I did some researching and discovered that the gentleman that had opened this restaurant now had another restaurant in Tempe. My husband and I decided that the reviews sounded promising with the delicious sounding homemade pasta and best in the Valley tirimisu. We decided to take our friend there for his birthday this past Saturday, and we made reservations. When we got there we were immediately liking the place, the lady up front was very friendly, and the live music was just awesome! Then we got to our table, and within minutes we had water and some very delicious bread. We decided to go with the Burrata e Pere for our appetizer, very very delicious! By the time we ordered our actual meals I think we had gone through  baskets of bread, it was so good! For our meal I ordered Fettuccine Pollo Asparagi, my husband ordered Chicken Scarpara, and our friend ordered Cecatelli al Forno. With each entree we got to choose a soup or salad, we all got the soups. My husband and our friend got the Italian Wedding soup and I got the Cream of Mushroom, both were homemade and extremely good. It was around this point that Mario, the owner came by our table and talked to us. Mario is a genuine person and truly cares about the people and that they are enjoying his place. When our entrees cam out we were really impressed by just how much food there was. We were all very much satisfied with all of our entrees, and the homemade pasta was so good in our friends dish! We even got to try the gnocchi in Alfredo, which put me and everyone at our table in food heaven! We had a fourth friend at our table but he had already ate so he just tried ours and when he was done trying ever thing he said I finally understand why so many people like Italian food Apparently he didnt like Italian food or even eat it that often before we took him here. So the appetizer, bread, soup and entrees were all amazing and sent me into a mini food coma. But then we had dessert, tiriamasu. When they brought it out the waiters and the live musician came to our table to sing our friend happy birthday to our friend. They brought enough forks for everyone and that was a good thing because none of of had ever tried a better tiriamasu! I was in heaven!! On our way out Mario said goodbye to us and we made reservations for Fathers Day. I am looking forward to going again soon with my husband and a couple of friends and I will definitely be ordering the Gnocchi and Tirimasu this time! nnI say this is a definite whether you enjoy Italian of not. The atmosphere was awesome, I loved the cozy family like feel of it, and the food is the best I have ever had in Italian dining!"
1,This place is amazing!!! Eaten there many times and I feel the food gets better everytime!! The fish and shrimp are to dye for!! So delicious!! Service is super quick and the people are very friendly!! Definitely make you feel like home with the best comfort food. Will continue to go there when I am in town!!!
1,"We came on a rare Sunday we were actually awake. The place had a steady queue, a sign of good food. There isnt much in waiting area and I hate creating a clusterfuck in front of the hostess booth where people are trying to ojt their name and check out. it was too cold to hang outside so we left our number with them to sit in the car instead.nnWe decided to sharennRueben Benedict I was expecting more like chunky pieces of corned beef but they use deli cut for this but guess that makes sense too. Overall solid Benedict as the Hollandaise was perfectly done.  We got their home froed potatoes which was pretty good flavor with peppers and onions. Only I might ask to get a bit of it crisped up next time.  nnJamms Signature Omelette  this isnt the fluffiest of omeletttes and is stiffer but still good. This has onions, mushrooms, peppers, steak and cheese in it topped with bernaise. It wasnt plentiful on the thin sliced steak think like philly cheese or gyro, but all the components were decent. We also got home fried potatoes with this and this comes with a bread choice.  nnSeeing as they are famous for potted bread we chose that.  They always have plain or cinnamon and rotate a flavor of the week. Vanilla caramel was this weeks which soinds like everything we liked. It is similar to brioche crisp on the top and fluffy inside and theu fave us a whipped butter frosting like spread.  Yeah,  Im a fan of the bread.  nnService was always friendly, and definitely on top of things. They are quite speedy here, our food was out in no time and drinks refilled stat. nnI can see why people like this place.  Its solid, no frills American hearty portioned breakfast with good service. Ill be back if I ever wake up early enough again."
1,"My Lovecrumbs, what BIG cakes you have.nnAnd what BEAUTIFUL furnishings.nnAnd what lovely, friendly, cakeloving staff.nnLovecrumbs is a realtively new cafue in the less frequented Grassmarket area but has given me good reason to make it more of a habit to pop by this way. Its a cake cafue. Exclusively. Just cake. I got chatting to the owner and she explained she wanted to open a cafue that had no soups, no sandwiches, none of that other nonsense  just cakes.nnAnd boy do those cakes look good. Triple layered sponge cakes. Meringues as big as my face. And I heard something about a chocolate and peanut butter cake, and a caramel and rose tart. These ladies take their cake seriously!nnI only had a tea when I came, but I shall return to try the cakes. But a group of three grown men were sitting next to me and it was practically When Harry Met Sally over there as they were all trying each others cakes. So yeah, they loved that cake and those crumbs."
1,"Definitely my favorite Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas so far.  Great food, great service, great ambience, music, and of course great Chips  Salsa. nnI want to give this place  star only so that people wont go here  then I can have this restaurant ALL TO MYSELF!  BWAHAHAHAHA"
1,"I chose this restaurant specifically for the  Soufflue.  Im a huge fan and I search out to find places that make this rare dessert.  This restaurant was nothing short of the sort. I was not disappointed!  In fact I feel Im a Soufflue connoisseur and this is by far the best I have ever had.  It was chocolate chip and so delightful and lots of it!  Now it doesnt go to say that the other five courses before dessert wasnt shy of deliciousness!  Overall, I WILL be back! Wonderful place for couples, anniversaries or whatever your occasion maybe."
1,Fried food haven!nnWe tried the following dishesnnKushiAgenAsian Pear  a must try!nBanananZucchini  a must try!nChicken ThighnOctopus LegnSilver fish  a must try!nSmelt fish  a must try!nShrimpnChilean SeabassnScallop good! nGarlic  good!nBamboo Shoot  good!nAsparagusnBeef Short Rib  a must try!nnFried Jidori Chicken  a must try!nAssorted Homemade Pickles  good!nYuzu Sorbet  a must try!nnThe rest were okay. They were good but nothing special. nnWe will be back! Next time we will try their sushi items.
1,wow we did not know you could mess up pancakes.  The biscuits must have been made by Ellie Mae Clampett.  We have renamed this place now on our not to go ever list The Flying Brick.  The sweet tea was good.
1,"You know the drill.nnGo to Marquee.  Get drunk and have a good time.  Leave early enough to grab a slice from Secret Pizza right next door.  Honestly I never remember what I get here, but its always good and not just because Im drunk half the time.  Theres usually a line especially at these odd hours, but the line moves pretty fast and its oh so worth it.  This is one of my top  postclub foods right up there with Steak  Eggs at Tuscanys."
1,"This was my introduction into Indian food.    The first few times I came here I was like ah not bad.  Then I started to try other places, even out of state and in other towns.   When I came back to IDP I really liked it.nnIf you go to a buffet, which I prefer, so you can try a bit of everything keep in mind that the dishes change daily.   If the food is not so good on Monday well go back on Tuesday and theyll have a few different items.nnThey had these parsnips once that were soooo good Ive been having nocturnal emissions about them for the past year. nnCool little shop that is attached to the restaurant, they have fresh bakery items, Indian food stuffs, and a ton of Bollywood movies."
1,"I was able to visit the newly relocated Passion in its beautiful new setting in Elizabeth.  Wow.  Truly amazing.  The duecor is simply beautiful and the food was just as amazing as in past visits to their old location.  What was even more surprising was how well the staff, the far majority of which must be new, really knew their product.  They were passionate about the experience we had as guests and yet they werent intrusive.  They worked so well as a team serving and clearing our table that you would have thought theyve all been working together for years.  This is SO hard to find in a new restaurant so we were impressed.nnThe new menu is a great presentation of what is currently fresh and current.  And they didnt forget to include an old favorite, the calamari cubano which redefines calamari for people like me that wont even order calamari elsewhere.  The unique approach to surf and turf that included a rare cut of meat with lobster roe was so creative and SO good.  Oh and the pork belly and fresh fish dishes were fantastic.  Have your server explain how they do the pork belly!nnI cant wait to visit again this week with my husband who had to miss out on the opening weekend!"
1,"I just moved to the area and dont know much about the local flavors. I searched for lunch specials close to work and found this place, and Im glad I did. Its a cute little hole in the wall with maybe a dozen tables and walls featuring colorful ink drawings by a local artist. Theres a TV playing a random Thai channel thats funny to watch. I ordered a Thai iced tea that was sweet and creamy in addition to the red curry lunch special. My lunch special came with the curry, a scoop of steamed rice, an eggroll, and a wonton. It was delicious, and I was literally served in five minutes. I came in at  and was done with my entire meal by . This place was definitely worth checking out and I will be coming back again!"
1,"Hole in the wall spot in a somewhat sketchy area, but definitely worth the stop if you just want some great priced food! You get WAY more food for your money than you would get anywhere else, and its pretty tasty too. They have tons of options. If you have a large family, then definitely check it out. Ive only been with one other person, but they have some killer specials for large parties that make me want to order them just cause they are that good of deals!"
1,"Under construction when I visited today, but still beautiful. Fellow botanical gardeners were friendly. nnBottled water is not overpriced. At . a bottle, it didnt sting that I forgot to bring my own water.nnPark rangers are stern, silently watching and protecting our picanik baskets from any impending doom.nnWear your best, as there are tons of photographers running around. This could be your chance to get discovered  maybe your errant hand or part of your backpack will end up in some semifamous hipsters Flickr!"
1,"Interesting poutinerie in HoMa. Industrial vibe pushed to its fullest  and its gorgeous. The place tries a little hard with the bottles of Sriracha everywhere, almost screaming wed never be so uncool as to have ketchup around.  nnBut right to business When your business name is Poutine Centrale, you got to deliver one darn good poutine. Good fries, the right curds, and a good gravy. Then, you can think about all the toppings and sides. nnThe fries were excellent, blanched, hot, and a bit serving. Likewise the cheese was fresh, in small chucks. The gravy was rather unimpressive, with no taste. I wondered whether its just a powder base  which would be surprising given that its should be able to make their gravy from scratch considering the amount they sell. The smoked meat version was excellent, with LOTS of meat that we couldnt finish.  nnAll in all, an excellent addition to the neighborhood. Other than their gravy needing some love, I think its an excellent poutine spot if youre in the area."
1,"My yo son fractured his arm and we made an appointment to see Dr. Sanders.  All the supporting staff were kind, professional and efficient.  Dr. Sanders was phenomenal.  He explained everything to us, answered all our questions and had my son laughing and smiling.  I highly recommend Dr. Sanders and count him in my blessings."
1,"OK, I know I am really lame when I am SO GLAD I stayed at the Doubletree on a recent work trip to Vegas.nnHeres why it rockednFree hour shuttle to and from the airport   no standing in ridiculously long taxi lines at McCarran.  Said shuttle will also give you a free ride to the MGM Grand but not back to the hotel, be warned.nDelicious free cookienIts relatively small no crazy lines to check innSuper friendly staff both the bartender and the front desk staff were very helpful and seemed to love life.  A rarity in Vegas.nNo slot machine noises!  This might be the best part.nFree wirelessnComfy comfy bed and pillowsnnI used to love the whole Vegas experience but I got it out of my system.  The Doubletree is a great alternative for those of us who are over Vegas but have to go there anyway."
1,eddie ds is really good you get a good amount of food for your money and the service is friendly.  I had the Robert and it was aawsome i would recommend anyone tryit once if you live or are in that area.
1,"I love Cracker Barrel!  Its my favorite chain restaurant and I stop in as often as I can. They give you hearty helpings of fantastic comfort food, have a great homey atmosphere and a cute store with all kinds of seasonal and novelty items. Their lunch and dinner meals are my favorite but breakfast is good too."
1,"As a disclaimer I have to say that Im a regular at the family of restaurants that brought this gem to this awesome neighborhood, so Ill try to report just the facts.nnThe decor and ambience is awesome. The detail of projecting a movie in the brick wall gives the place a unique charm.nnThe food was as good as the location in Tempe which from my point of view is awesome. This restaurant is my daughters favorite place as well and believe me, shes not shy to tell what she thinks!nnThe massive bar is the perfect place to have a drink or a nice conversation with a friend or date.nnThe wine list is great and balanced with a little bit of everything to please all kinds of tastes.nnDid I mention that the prices are great? Just like the location in Tempe, you couldnt do any better with twice of the money. nnYes, I have to admit it, I just LOVE la Bocca.nnCheers!nnPS its sister location across the street is awesome as well Modern Margarita. I could live the rest of my life going back and forth from one place to the other."
1,"I love Ginza and the idea of a sushi bar in a pseudo dinning car. I mean it makes sense. Japan grew to its world status by copying American processes and refining, how more Americana can you get than a chrome dining car that failed as a retro s diner?nSushi, as I have been lead to believe, is a communal  social endeavor. At Ginza, it is hard to do with the loud Japanese pop music. I prefer my sushi with more soothing music or at least with music at a volume that you can carry on a conversation. Maybe I am the exception and not the norm.nI love the food and the service is good and friendly and, as previously mentioned, there is no better place to celebrate a birthday. I recommend you to find out yourself. It is awesome!"
1,"I stopped in for a quick treat after a day at the spa next door. I had never been in before, and walked in not quite knowing where to go  I didnt see the wall where the yogurts are located when I walked in  duh but the employees where helpful and friendly. Lots of lowfat, nonfat, no sugar added varieties and the most toppings I think Ive ever seen at a Froyo joint.  Great prices, my little cup cost me less than ....although I didnt really load my serving up. Very fun place!"
1,"My favorite roast beef sandwich of all time... mmm, I wish there were Potbellys in California!!!  Toasted just the right way and has soo many great toppings, in particular the hot peppers and their mustard set them apart from other places.  Used to be one of the only places I could find Orangina in Illinois, so a plus for that too!"
1,"I WAS a Dim Sum Virgin ... Until Monica O. posted Februarys Breakfast Club UYE at Mekong Palace. nnI clicked Im in! and off I went on a Saturday to finally validate that Dim Sum VCard.  nnSo this place is in a mall food court however, once our group of  got situated, I barely noticed. nnGlad we had Norm with us for guidance, because I sure as Heck wouldnt have a clue what to do! nnMy favorites were the BBQ Pork Steamed Buns, the squid and one of the noodle dishes. nnWe tried what seemed like an endless parade of different plates. I know I definitely left quite full. So you can imagine my surprise when we each paid  after tip! nnReally enjoyed the company and of course, the food. Look forward to coming back in the future ... And trying Hot Pot!"
1,"By far, my favorite sub joint.  Ive tried most, but keep going back to the Italian.  Awesome bread joined up with grilled meats run through the oven with cheese and finally dressed with all the goodies.  Getting hungry just thinking about it.  Awesome home cut fries, good home squeezed lemonade."
1,"Item   come eat here if you still havent made up your mind on giving this place a try!  You will LOVE it!nnItem  if you dont know what you want to eat, definitely try the Cavatelli with Broccoli Rabe.  Also you can try the Baked Cannelloni  delicious.  I tried a bit of the seafood plate with the white sauce also, and it was a lot better than I have expected.nnItem  this place pretty much never disappoint, so what are you waiting for???"
1,"I love, love, love Cibo! I know it has tons of great reviews but I feel it is time to add my own. In my opinion Cibo is better than Pizzeria Bianco and way less wait. nnThis is a great place for sharing. My favorite night at Cibo goes like this...nThe delicious pesto salad.  I am not usually a big salad person but this one is quite interesting.nThen on to the pizza. I generally get the margherita pizza but had the diavola the other day and now I am hooked.nFor desert all of the crepes are amazing.nAnd if youve never had limoncello I highly recommend you try it!nAnd of course you can always share a bottle of wine for dinner. nnGreat food, reasonable prices and beautiful patio!"
1,"Good beer and the bartenders are always awesome. This place is a regular, and sometimes frequent stop, along the travels of the Strip in Planet Hollywood. The bartenders are always friendly and actually have a personality it makes for entertaining conversations. Never had a bad experience in the numerous times Ive been here. Sin City has only a few beers that they serve but what they make, they do it well. Theres a light for all you weirdos who go to a microbrewery and want Bud Light wtf, IPA, Amber, Stout, and Hefeweizen. Thats it. But theyre all so good, thats good enough.nnReasonably priced too. And Im a geek and love the gear they have for sale pint glasses, tshirts, cute shorts, and even beer taps!. Go support this place, they rock!"
1,"Hands down the best dance club in town !!!  Great djs that always play solid top  mixes. The Gogo dancers are by far, the hottest in town. Getting bottle service is the only way to go at OAK. The cocktail waitresses provide excellent service and are always on top of their game. The dancefloor is always packed and their are always girls roaming around. The bottle service presentations are always amazing. The girls coming out in the cars for bottle presentations is insane. Great nightclub."
1,Love this place!  My husband wont usually go more than  miles from our house for food but that was before I brought him here!  Great happy hour plus awesome variety on the menu along with some of the best fries in the city!  We havent been for breakfast so will have to try that soon!  Check the weekly paper for  for  coupons!!
1,"So first and foremost, Id like to say thank god for this breakfast place in Southern Highlands. It makes my heart smile, I love breakfast and hate the drive all the way to The Cracked Egg all the way on Rainbow. So about the food......my new favorite is the stuffed blueberry french toast.....it was deliciously warm and very satisfying. You have to try that plate!! My boyfriend loved the steak and eggs, his words the steak was to die for!! I was very impressed with not only the food but the cute and quaint decor.......the hanging flowers from the ceiling was a nice touch and I have found my new found breakfast place and would recommend this one to everyone who is deciding or contemplating on coming in to try this place....not to mention the prices are perfectly priced for the food...great job!!"
1,Family dined here for NYE  and we were so happy with our dining experience. The bonein rib eye was the best steak Ive ever had and Im hungry just thinking about it. The bread and butter they served was also really delicious. Im not a person who eats a lot of bread but I couldnt stop eating it. I dont know why people werent pleased with this place because the food is top quality and the servers were very attentive. The switch is cute and just make the dining experience a little more fun than your typical dim steakhouse.
1,Did an internet search for a salon in Vegas with good reviews and this is where we ended up.  My husband needed a haircut and was fortunate Jessica was available and we didnt have an appointment.  She not only asked what he wanted but also offered suggestions.  She took her time and did a fantastic job.  She even had time to give me a trim and also did a great job.  We highly recommend Jessica and her shop to anyone in the area.  Prices are very reasonable.  When were back in Vegas our first stop will be  Hair  U then the blackjack tables!
1,"Thank you Man Vs. Food for reviewing this place! Fricken amazing! Simple and delicious, busy, but quick, the simplicity is what I love about this place Seafood  Sauce  Bag  vigorous shaking  HOT N JUICY!nnWhen you go I would suggest a pound of the king crab in pepper lemon sauce not spicy and a pound of crawfish SPICY! You will not be disappointed!nnENJOY!"
1,"If you regularly eat at decent restaurants, much of Vegas can be somewhat disappointing. Envy, on the other hand, was a total surprise. We made a reservation for dinner and I was a bit nervous when we entered the nearempty restaurant. Maybe people dont know about this place or are wary of the prices. Either way, those dummies are totally missing out.nnI ordered a salad to start and it was big enough to split. The bread was delicious especially the olive bread and the butter was room temp, perfect for spreading. We both ordered petit filets, and both were cooked to the perfect temperature, a disturbing rarity these days. For sides, we split garlic mashed potatoes and asparagus with hollandaise sauce. Both sides were delicious and were more than enough for  people. To finish, we had coffee, no room for desert.nnIn general, the prices were on par with other steakhouses around the country and the use of a restaurants.com gift certificate makes this one a bit more affordable for a special night out. Our waiter was excellent, coming by to check on us at exactly the right moments. I will definitely come again if I ever find myself in Vegas."
1,"I loved our pink hotel!!nnTo begin with, you must realize that currently the Flamingo is a Donny and Marie whorehouse.nDonny Osmonds laughing, joyful face is in at least ten different locations, not to mention the Donny and Marie logo plastered on the entire outside of the hotel.nI almost jacked the technicolor dreamcoat! Kidding..nnOur room was futuristic to no end  erotic pink light in the bathroom, flat screen TV, yet another TV in the freakin bathroom mirror, automatic windowblind opener, and more!nMost of all, we could see the Bellagio fountain show from our room! Amaazazazing.nnWe had no problems at all! The location is prime  it has its own monorail station and its close to everything.nnIt seems from others reviews that the hotel is a hit or miss. Luckily for us it was a big hit."
1,"The BEST instructors and the best curriculum!!!  I have a  year old daughter and   yr old son.  My daughter started swimming here at age  and my son at age .  They both swim beautifully thanks to the TALENTED and WELLTRAINED staff.  The facility is always CLEAN, SAFE and ORGANIZED.  And as a bonus the managerssupervisors are kind and LISTEN and RESPOND to any concerns you may have as a parent.  I tried several other places in the valley with my first child and Gold Medal stands out as THE BEST place for young swimmers by a large margin."
1,"Authentic old school saloon. I liked it a lot here. Its a very small bar, but Its got stools, and whiskey at a fair price thats all I need! Its right in Old Town  when I went, there was more of an oldertourist crowd as opposed to the college youngins. I swear I also saw the worlds oldest cowboy here had to be  years old. nSo if your in a Cowboy chasinwhiskey drinkin kind of mood check this place out."
1,"If you dont mind centering hours around okayquality buffets, then this is for you.  Its a great price for a lot of food, depending on if you were planning on spending that much on food anyway. The quality isnt great, but the variety and excitement of trying different buffets is fun.nn buffets during the hour period is definitely doable and very realistic.  We chose to do dinner at the Village Seafood Buffet at the Rio  pm Friday night w short line, breakfast at Paris about  minutes wait at  am Saturday morning, and dinner at Planet Hollywood no wait at  pm on Saturday night...though a HUGE line formed at  pm.   buffets was the perfect amount, since more would be too much food and too much time going from one hotel to another and waiting in line.  Granted our lines werent too long this past weekend, I cant imagine doing more than this many buffets on a busy weekend.  nnTIP Go to the buffet youre looking forward to the most FIRST, and the one youre not as excited about last.  Do one good buffet for dinner, and the other one for breakfastlunch.  Your last buffet definitely wont taste as good or be as exciting after all the gorging and excitement from the first couple you go to.nnWe decided to do the Village Seafood Buffet at the Rio first, since I love seafood and was looking forward to that.  I parked in the Masquerade parking lot of the Rio, which lead directly to the buffet on the first floor.  We went and got our Total Rewards card first which was a  minute line on a Friday night in March, this past weekend. It wasnt a far walk from the buffet.  Just a few minutes into the casino and youll see signs.nnOnce we got our card, we got in line to the buffet.  Since the Village Seafood was new to the Buffet of Buffets, I asked to make sure we could buy our Buffet of Buffets there.  And sure enough, we could.  They used our Total Rewards card as the buffet card and gave us a receipt to put on our table while we eat there and hold on later to in case for some reason the card doesnt work.  Make sure to take the receipt off your table when you leave the buffet.  It has the Buffet of Buffets listed on there.nnOf the  buffets we went to, Paris was my favorite for breakfast and lunch.  Here are the good and maybe unique things I noticed about each.nnVillage Seafood Buffet at Rio  pm, Friday night   min waitn stars  not that much unique food, and only worth it if youre okay with the following and really craving itn small halves of lobster tailsn warm plump shrimp in lobster tail mixn oysters frozen and thawedn crab claws not fresh and kinda mushyn cold crab legs though most buffets have thisnnLe Village at Paris  am, Saturday morning   min waitn stars  LOTS of variety for breakfast and lunchn sweet crepes made to order though they used preserves instead of fresh berriesn omelets made to order VERY nice guy serving us at this stationn lox Make your own bagel, cream cheese, and smoked salmon lox! I LOVED this and wish I got it first.n small Mediterranean sectionn lunch food served along with breakfast breakfast is served until  pm, they said nnPlanet Hollywood  pm, Saturday night  no wait...LONG line at  pm!n stars  nothing special or too unique, but good variety of foodn Mediterranean, American, Mexican, Italian, Asian foodsn chocolatecovered strawberries load up on these whenever you see them because they go quick taste like fondue chocolate though and not real melted quality chocolaten good variety of food, though most sections were small and didnt have a lot of different foodsnPH was a PAIN to find. The parking lot is over on the side and also behind on the street parallel to LV Blvd. You cant get in from LV Bvld, so dont waste your time like we did.  THEN, we had to walk through mall about  minutes to get to the casino.  What a pain!  Maybe I missed it, but access to PH made me never want to go there again by car.nnIf I had this to do over again, I think I might not even get this Buffet of Buffets card, unless I want lots of food and dont care too much about quality.  I apparently tried the  that had the highest ratings and wasnt impressed with any of them except the Paris buffet.  nnI think I might just fork out the extra cash and do either the Bellagio or Wynn buffets, which I heard great things about.  Theyre about  each though.  And definitely I would do the Paris for breakfastlunch again.  Those two would probably add up to a bit more than what I spent on the Buffet of Buffets card with the Village Seafood added about  total, with Total Rewards card.  nnI think Id rather spend more on quality over quantity. Plus, it was a bit of a pain scheduling our day around driving to the hotels and waiting in line for buffets. I think you may do that anyway, but with this card, you have to time it right to get in your moneys worth for the hour period, especially if you wanna do more than  buffets."
1,"Fatty delicious goodness! Im so sad this is their last remaining location... it sucks how far this is from my house or maybe its for the best!. nnThey have socalled diet fried chicken. Somehow they claim its less fatty and less calorific because they pull off the skin THEN fry it. Hmmm.. I dont buy that this stuff is healthy, but damn it tasted awesome. Plus I loved how they let me get  legs unlike most fried chicken places that require you to get a legthigh combo. nnWe also tried the cloqueetos ok that doesnt look right, but its spelled something like that!.. so they are basically just chicken taquitos with tons of cheese and lettuce and salsa. Delish, but they definitely could have used some sour cream. nnMashed potatoes and gravy were heavenly. nnBiggest disappointment was the gross cold rolls that came out of a bag. Fried chicken places typically have YUMMY homemade rollsbisquits.. SOMETHING... wtf is up with the crappy grocery store sht guys? Otherwise this place was greasy goodness."
1,I come here probably  times a week and I dont think Ill ever get tired of it. The staff is very friendly and if theres a line it moves fast. As a Chicago native I know what an original Als beef taste like and you can definitely get that here but you gotta coach the person taking your order. If you want it like home you must tell them to soak your sandwich .....thank me later
1,Sandra is fantastic and very easy to talk to. She always makes me feel very comfortable during my appointments. Her prices are seriously unbeatable and scheduling is as simple as a text message. I love this place!
1,Last meal in Vegas before we have to fly home to idaho.  You know that saying save the best for last?  Well that is the case with Guys restaurant.   Was not disappointed at all.  Even our son said we need to come back here again after eating the drunken fish tacos.nnThe mac n cheese bacon burger was legit.  Turn into Harras to park and wind your way back to the Quad. Once you Valet park it is right there. Winner winner chicken dinner.
1,"The best BBQ Ive ever had, the best smoked meat Ive ever had, the best sauces Ive ever had. This place has it all! nIts inexpensive, everything is delicious and has a monthly rotation of great beer at a good price.nnBit of advice get there early, its always packed."
1,"My almost  yr. old and my  yr. old absolutely wore themselves out!  At a little under , they had more fun than they ever had!  Super clean and the staff is very friendly. They even came up to me once the boys were playing and made sure we were enjoying everything.  nnI was worried about their age and what theyd be able to do and of course theres the worry of the older, bigger kids.  Because I went early afternoon on a Thursday, there were hardly any big kids there.  It took them about a few minutes to understand that they could do whatever they liked and the rest is history.  There was a birthday party rolling in and they were older kids but thats when the referee started really walking the floor to keep them from running and other antics that would endanger themselves and others.  nnI will say, and it is highly recommended on their website, stay with your children.  Dont count this as a babysitting service.  And for the smaller ones, avoid weekends.nnWe will be returning very soon!"
1,"Tried Windsor last night for the first time. I was having dinner with a friend and she really wanted something with a patio dinning area because of the awesome weather weve had all weekend. Thanks to some fellow reviewers we stumbled upon this place and thought we would give it a try. nnWell worth it!! The outside seating section was excellent and got crowded just after we got there around pm. Unfortunately their happy hour ends at pm but both their beer list and cocktail selection looked outstanding. nnFor starters, we tried the Cheese Fondue appetizer with Pretzels and Apples. Amazing! Very creaming and tasty, could have been an entree on its own if you were in the mood. nnFor dinner I had the Porkwich, it combines bacon, pulled pork, ham and coleslaw a top a Kaiser roll. Very Tasty!!! All of the pork was tender and the crunchy coleslaw added to the various flavors. For the side dish, I had to try the Mac n Cheese. A bit more cheese and less bread crumbs would have make them perfect but you cant have it all. It was all mighty delicious. nnWe didnt wander over to the ice cream parlor next door but maybe next time. nnYes, it is bit pricey but seemed to be well worth it. Their happy hour does run all week long including weekends. Alos, make sure you look for street parking in the neighborhood next to the restaurant before surrendering your car over to Valet to save a bit."
1,We had a great experience here! It was my first time and I was overwhelmed with all the different options. Kris behind the counter was patient with our indecisiveness and helped us choose a great meal. I had the Salmon Chimichurri Burrito and my girlfriend tried a couple of their tacos. Everything was delicious and filling. The original fish taco is amazing! Thank you Kris for making my first time memorable. We will definitely be back!
1,"Well I was very impressed with Table .  The wife and I went to Vegas for a couple of days at the end of our vacation.  As I was rollin dice at Palazzo I saw a sign for a special  course tasting menu at Table  for .  I know a good deal when I see one so I made a reservation for later that evening.  nnI have to admit that a  course tasting menu can sometimes not be too filling but I was pleasantly surprised at how large all of the portions were.  I started out with the candied bacon.  Not that I would ever complain about bacon but its kind of like a maple bacon you might get at a lot of places.  The wife got a crab salad which was excellent and had a surprisingly large portion of crab.  For nd course, I got a Boston Salad which tasted....... just like a Boston Salad.  The wife went with a beef carpacio.  The carpacio was sliced soooooo thin yet packed such a large amount of flavor..... genius!  For main course I got the Kurobota Pork rack.  It was a huge piece of pork and after I was done I was completely full.  Cooked perfectly as pork can get very dry if overdone.  The wife got scallops which was tasty but maybe the only dish that wasnt a heaping plate of food.  After we were both completely stuffed the waiter asked us what we wanted for desert.  I managed to stuff down maybe half of the banana cream pie I ordered.  Excellent pie and full of banana chunks.  The wife ordered a trio of sorbet and unlike the vast majority of restaurants that give you  tiny teaspoons of sorbet Emeril gave us  large ice cream scoopers of sorbet!  nnVery impressed by this joint.  Would highly recommend.  But I think the  course tasting menu was a summer special so it might not be around much longer."
1,"Only downer is they dont have a huge selection of frames to choose from.nnAlice helped me on my visit I already had my Rx  she laughed that it was in Spanish... and didnt fret that they couldnt verify it with the doctor in SA.  She weighed in on frame selection when I started to get stressed about picking new glasses and was  helpful.nnI was told theyd take about  weeks to come in, but I received a call only a week later and they were ready. nnI had worn contacts in, so they gave me a case and some solution to remove while I got fitted for the new glasses.  I had a bit of trouble seeing far away, so she made a few adjustments, fitted them properly to my face, and off I went.nn better than Lenscrafters."
1,"I came here for the Around the World Sampler, which is  sample cups of CocaCola beverages from, well, around the world. Its the most fun you can have for , either in Vegas or possibly anywhere but Im in my late s and my standards are kind of low these days. I was expecting little Costcosized sample cups, but the amount they give you of each beverage is substantial. Four people could easily share one sampler and get a good taste of each. Theres only one I thought was actually disgusting, and I will sadistically not tell you which one.nnBeyond the cafe, its a very large souvenir store. Not surprisingly, the items they sell are VERY expensive.  for a pair of pajama pants,  for a Coke bear,  for a lip balm sampler. I think this store is missing a golden opportunity by not having a machine that will customprint a Share a Coke With... bottle for you. I have a kid with an unusual name and I would have paid their insane prices to bring home a bottle with his name on it. Im not negatively reviewing the store for that, I just think it would be neat."
1,Two words... Steak Nachos probably called something else.  The service was good but I was blinded by that dish.  They were very hospitable to a large professional group we were hosting there.  Nice place.
1,"the french bread here is sooo good. as is the butter that accompanies it. i think that was the favorite part of my meal, although i did also enjoy the heirloom tomato salad and the db burger. speaking of the burger, i shared it with a few other people so i dont think i got the foie gras and short rib in my portion, but i can only imagine how OTT over the top that combination must be. i tried a friends short rib and steak and both were tender and delicious. the duck confit was fairly good but a little too salty. overall i think DB is a bit on the overpriced side, but i dont regret dining there. especially since afterward, the manager walked us past the line at tryst and got us right into the club. SCORE!"
1,"This place was so good!  I got a mozzarella, tomato, and basil panini for lunch and it was DELISH.  I also got  cupcakes to go, and they were all amazing!  Better cupcakes than Sprinkles.  I am going to be a regular"
1,"I use to drive to Orange County for nem nuong this good . The nem nuong  spring rolls  is definitely the best in Vegas . The restaurant is clean n service is friendly . nI also ordered the broken rice dish with grill shrimp , grill pork , shrimp roll , bi  sliced pork w pork skin  and steam egg cake . It a great dish with everything ! Taste great n price is very reasonable ."
1,"Been here three times...but for some reason the quality is going down. I want to give this  s but last time it just didnt live up to the hype. I brought my girl and she was like this is the place you keep raving about?! Boy did I feel dumb.nnOn my first visit I had the Chef Omakase. I was the only one at the bar because I was gambling for so long. I made a killing at the tables and was feeling rather giddy  so I went all out. The sushi chef asked me if I had any allergiesno likes... which is easy for me  no octopus and no squid. nnWow did he come out guns blazing  A toro over warm rice with some special sauce. It nearly blew off my mouth. Then he went with a three lineup selection  Hamachi, Red Snapper and More Maguro.. but these had some sauces and jalapenos and ginger. Nice follow up. I said. How are you going to beat that....nnHe surprised me with a Peruvian slice of Filet mignon covered with Foie Gras. WOW dang that I guess I will stop doubting this chef. He lined up a couple more slices of sushi and I thought it was over. Pretty good, but I am thinking he is ending on the wrong note when he busts out a fried rice cake with Foie Gras and yellowtail Belly.... I nearly jumped out of my seat of how good that was. After that experience I adamantly recommended this to friends who wanted to try something different.nnOn subsequent visits with a couple friends we did Omakase again, but this time it was mostly rolls. I mean the sushi was great but the rolls left me wanting. Gone was the foie gras...and with that my th star.nnOn my last visit my girlfriend ate pretty standard stuff nothing spectacular and since we didnt do Omakase I was left on my own to decide which usually means pretty boring. I love the surprises chefs give me  when I order Omakase. Hopefully I will be back and the chef can surprise me and make me change my rating...until that my  s will stand. nnThis place does get busy since it turns into a club some nights. Sit at the bar if you want the more crazy experience. I still love this place but with all the places on the strip, other places may get my business..."
1,"Was heading back from ASU yesterday and came across a brand new Dunknin that just opened. This one is the TITS! Store is huge and has tons of space for seating. Drivethru was packed with cars so I went inside to see the store anyway. The line was to the door but moved fast. There was someone greeting all the customers and even handing out free samples of the Frozen Cappucino! This sample was so good I decided to get one for myself. I tried the new Chicken parmesan flatbread which was very tasty! My friend got a fresh, warm bagel with cream cheese ans we also both tried the french crueller since they looked delicious!nnThere was a Starbucks right down the road which was dead when we passed it so it seems everyone is finally realizing that Dunkin coffee is so much better and much more inexpensive too! Atleast now I know I visit this Dunkin when heading to ASU!"
1,"I read the reviews, looked at the pictures, but still did not expect the dining experience I had at Il Vinaio.  The atmosphere was very lively, with several different guys getting up to sing and a live band playing some Italian tunes.nWe started out with the share platter, which was a great starter. The veggies and soppressata all seemed fresh, and with a glass of wine could probably satisfy the needs of a couple light eaters.  For our entree we chose the rigatoni with tenderloin tips and the braised pork shank.  It has been a long time since I had a pork shank, but I dont recall it being as tender and juicy as this one.  Rigatoni was excellent as well.  There wasnt one thing on either of our plates that I would have given under  stars.  Couple that with great service and a fun atmosphere, and Il Vinaio has given me a good reason to occasionally visit Mesa."
1,"I ate here with a group of friends from out of town on Saturday night.  The atmosphere was good and we sat at one of the larger round tables below a chandelier that looked like it could kill all of us at once, a friend noted.nnSince I was at an English pub, I selected the small order of Fish  Chips and I was fairly impressed by the size of the cod and the right amount of breading fried enough where it wasnt too greasy.  The fries or chips were standard, but the fish was good and large enough for me to be happy.  I even took one of the large pieces home for the wife.  My friends got a myriad of things and they all had good things to say due to the large portions, especially the nachos.  Another Englishfare eats include Bangers and Mash from what I remember.  nnAfter dinner, we went to the rooftop and had a drink or two.  It was a nice night for it, and the lighting was good and we had a friendly server upstairs who offered a sample of beer that we werent familiar with.  I would come back if I was in the mood for English food and rooftop scene in Fort Mill."
1,"Dinner for  on a Saturday night. We got there a bit early and the place was starting to fill up. The decor and the ambiance are tiptop. The menu is very unique. An eclectic mix of Asian dishes. We started off with two sets of dumplings  Smoked Pig Face and Smoked Bok Choy. Both very delicious. The pig is definitely the moist, fatty dark meat. I love it, but perhaps not for all. The Bok Choy turned out to be very flavorful. Lots of spice to it as well. nnWe had a mix of entrees. Scallop special only  scallops, but well done, Mission Chinese Kung Pao Pastrami spicy and delectable, Kimchi Fried Rice a bit salty, but well done, and the Roasted Pork Noodles very tasty. nnI think that the only thing lacking was the service. It started off good, but went downhill fast. That said, I will chalk it up to the place being brand new when we dined there. nnNjoy"
1,Wow...what a lucky find the Cortez Room was for us. In town for a convention at the Rio...impossible to get a table at any of the restaurants there in a timely fashion so using Yelp we located the Cortez Room. We were able to get in quickly..the service was superb and the food amazing. So great that we returned the following night with another group of friends and were thrilled that once again the service and food were excellent. The Steak Diane was to die for!  I plan to make the Cortez Room a go to site for dinner whenever I am in Las Vegas.
1,"Not a big burger fan here but hey, when in Rome right? Rob brought me here and told he hed order for me so i wouldnt have and prejudges. nnWe sat down and when our burger arrived. Service was very friendly and fast and she even went for our tap waters while this wasnt part of the service at all.nnThe Sin City burger definatly hit the spot! The sauce was awesome! Burger perfectly cooked and a nice crispy bun. nNo more mcDonalds for me. Id rather pay  bucks more for this feast!"
1,"I highly recommend Strut! I loved every minute of my experience! Stephanie made it so easy and an absolute joy! I honesty didnt know what to expect as it was my first attempt at looking for a wedding dress and the thought of it kind of overwhelmed me. However, as soon as I walked in, I was put at ease and the fun began! There were so many options  Stephanie let me try on everything I wanted to try, but she really did great at knowing exactly what to pull for my body type and heard me when I explained the style I was going for. I also want to share that Im getting the mother of the bride and bridesmaids dresses here too since they are able to get them in any size from  and up! Makes my life much easier knowing we are all in good hands! P.S. The prices are AWESOME!"
1,"Its brilliant! Im a proud coffeeaholic and this is by far the best coffeeshop in town. The beans imported are amazing, and the staff phenomenal. Every delectable cup is made with pride, and to perfection. I highly recommend this place."
1,"When you are trying to quench your thirst while doing a little shopping and you want something aside from the typical soda or lemonade.nnProsn    Gelato , Cappuccinos,  Smoothies ! n    One free Booster for free in your smoothiesn    Good Customer Servicen    Guavasteen  My favorite of the drinks.nnConsn    Im not a big fan of their gelato flavors.  If you like tarty flavors though, youll love itn  nOveralln  While doing a little shopping at the newly renovated Premium South Oulets, I went here for a refreshing beverage.  I went with the Guavasteen, which Ive had a few times actually.  Actually, all the smoothies Ive had from here are pretty good.  You can get one free booster with every smoothie  Protein, Focus, etc.  Ive tried their Gelato too.  Although I listed it as a Con, I think its fair to state that Im not much into the tarty flavors.  They do have Cappuccino flavor too.  nnTipsn    Ask for a sample of whatever it is you may want to try.  They are more than willing to let you sample it prior to making your decision.n    Do not forget to ask for your free booster, otherwise they wont even offer it.  n    Their menu has a break down of the caloric intake for each drink if thats your fancy."

1,"The look and ambiance of Del Friscos for dinner tonight was nice. It was a slow relaxed Monday night... And we loved that. The food was VERY GOOD! We are picky and Nothing was disappointing. My husband and I both ordered the Rib Eye. It wasnt the Best rib eye weve had but it was still very good. We both tried a bite of my sisters Burger and lets just say we pressed pause on our steaks, packed them to go and ordered a burger!!! The best!! It was tender, juicy and flavorful! I would recommend this place this someone else. jeisavana"
1,"Affordable lunch or dinner conveniently located within the VenetiannnAs others have said, this is very much like a cheesecake factory. Huge menu, reasonably price, and very good food. The nice thing is that they arent price gouging as they easily could considering its location within the Venetian.nnService was excellent. Our waitress was extremely attentive providing refills, more bread, and the check promptly. She was also very friendly and provided a lot of options that were recommended by her and frequently by guests. nnI ordered the caramel chicken which came with a large portion of rice. This was a massive portion and I could only eat half of it even though I was very hungry. The chicken was very good and nice and crispy. Very similar to an orange chicken from a chain restaurant but a bit sweeter and overall tasted better.nnOverall, great restaurant.. large portions, great service, and affordable."
1,I went to the safe keeper and browsed. Also went to discount gun safe to look. I decided on the Dakota DS.  otd wdelivery from Lana at the tent sale in Henderson. I am very happy with my purchase. The delivery was very quick about min. I recommend the safe keeper for your security needs. I have confidence when I leave my firearms and valuables at home now.
1,"The View is amazing, and adds a romantic ambiance to the overall dinning experience. Our servers were very attentive without hovering, we got a bottle of wine, which they kept chilled at the bar for us. We got the lump crab  artichoke dip, which was delicious, and a very ample portion, so much so I opted for a salad and soup for dinner pathetic I know while at a steak house, but the boyfriend let me try some of his steak. The wedge salad was pretty standard, good dressing, but had  pieces of almost whole bacon, not crumbled. The French onion soup was fabulous, cheese was nice and crispy on top, and a good amount of onions. The boyfriend got the Ribeye, perfectly cooked to medium, and nice grill marks and a juicy center. We will be back."
1,"They are almost always fast, and although I am a frequent flyer I have only had one crappy doctor.n There are two waiting rooms, one has plugs for phones, etc. always able to find a seat, and bathrooms nearby.n Parking is easy, but a little dangerous because of the drivers, must be the Starbucks Robertos in the same lot making people frantic.n The people who check me in are polite, not overly friendly, which I appreciate. Makes the lines go faster if they dont bond, and Im here for long enough without that. Loln There is a TV in the waiting room, but bring a jacket cause it gets nippy."
1,"Wahsun has the unique distinction of most likely being the only Chinese restaurant in the Valley, which serves Chinese food.  Yes, you read right ... Im not having a stroke  this is REAL Chinese food as its meant to be and not the slop most Americans think is Chinese food.  The restaurant has its flaws  the young girl playing waitress is inefficient, sullen and spends more time listening to music than taking care of guests.  But shes a kid wheres the surprise.  The place is run by a husband  wife team and they are usually overwhelmed and cant handle the customers efficiently.  Sometimes, dad goes a bit overboard with the oil in the wok and customers need to open the door to the restaurant to let the smoke out.  And you might be waiting a while for dinner  bring a book.  Oh and they dont take credit cards.  So, you might ask  why the positive attitude?  Because all of that is outweighed by huge portions of real and tasty Chinese food as your imperialistic, colonizing  great grandparents had, when they forced westernization on China at the end of a gunship.  The Chinese eventually got back at us by ensuring that any and all emigrants to the U.S. couldnt cook to save their lives.  Somehow, they forgot to brainwash this couple.  nnTry the eggrolls, hot and sour soup and duck for an idea of what these dishes are supposed to taste like!  Be very careful of ordering portions like youre used to at other places  they really do serve huge amounts for little money.  Your stomach will be happy your wallet will do the Happy Dance.  nnSome reviewers have said, that the restaurant plays loose and easy with their hours and this is true.  Theyre supposed to be open till pm  ahh, the joys of late night dining in a major city but sometimes theyll stay open later ... sometimes not.  Be flexible!  I know, its frustrating but the food is worth it.  Come here and youll never eat Chop Suey or Fried Rice ever again!nnClosed on Thursdays?  OK ... thats strange, I know.  But hey, look on the bright side  theyre open when everyone but chain restaurants are closed on Monday."
1,"Im a frequent traveler to Las Vegas, my favorite Persian restaurant is Habibs.  Ive visited many Persian restaurants across the US, this is the most beautiful.  The quality of the food is suburb and Habib is always happy to accommodate special requests."
1,"OMG regarding wait time complaint. Yes it takes a few minutes to cook  oz of beef to perfection. Slow down, order a specialty drink and enjoy this place!! Yes, I tried the wings I always do They were awesome. They call them medium but they were pretty hot, I ordered a side of hot sauce and that was great,  No complaints. But you must try the PIG WINGS!!! They are like bonein riblets, pig drumettes, whatever... with spicy sweet peach hot sauce that is just worth the trip. And the burgers are great,  oz is HUGE, Everything cooked as ordered. The Hatch Chile burger was especially good. Staff was fast, fun, environment was full of energy and a very ecclectic clientele which I crave here in the desert. The beer was cold, and the bartender whipped up some specialty frinks that would knock even a seasoned drinker on their ASS. Try the blue rufie if youre a wimpy drinker, tastes like candy. Also good is the blueberry martini. YES, FULL BAR. Burger buns were really good, maybe they flew em in from Jersey but AZ never gets bread this good. No complaints ...will be back. Oh, and girls hula hoop in the parking lot if you get bored. They will share."
1,Ummm... gorditas.... I approve nSalsas  are an OK. Shredded cabbage was a nice compliment to a meal.nnnP.S. People... I know its America but after so many years living in LV I have no trouble ordering food in Spanish. Just accept the fact that not everyone does speak English and get a couple of Spanish food ordering lessons. Dont diss the place just because of that.
1,"My first thought was, this is gonna be hotel food, but this is definitely one of those books you cant judge by the cover! nnTwo particular highlights n this steak ranks in the top two, if not the top spot on our search for the Valleys best, for its simple, beefy flavor, perfect temperature and soft, melty texture. n the use of beet in the beet salad is brilliant! They are creatively disguised as ravioli casing tucked inside a sweet, salty mixture of locallysourced goat cheese, candied fruit and nuts. nnThe missing star is for the venue The environment is disloyal to the kitchen. Tucked away on the property with no view to warrant its placement, dim lighting with no further romance... Marriott has a gem here that deserves the polish to shine!"
1,"Smashburger Review  My experience and WHY you should eat here!nnThis was my first time going to Smashburger, after hearing good things about it from my brother and a few people I know. nnOverall experience was great, but let me break it down for ya. nnMenu nn Simple small selection, but easy to read and make a choicen Signature burgers and chicken sandwichesn Variety of saladsn Build your own choicesn Regular size and Big size to choose from for your burgernnServicenn Very welcoming and helpful when I asked questionsn Brought our order out to us after we orderedn Wait time was a couple minutes, not bad at all thoughnnRestaurantnn Clean and modern looking interiorn Open seating, booths and tables with chairsn Comfortable booth seats and lots of table spacen Clean restroomsnnFoodnn BBQ Bacon Cheddar Burger was great, good size and cooked perfectlyn Sweet potato smashfries were AMAZING, prob the best I ever hadn Girlfriend got the Mushroom swiss burger, she loved it, good size toon Girfriend got the regular smash fries and they were good, nice and crispyn They also offer beers, and let you have it in a bottle or a mugnnCostnn More than I was expecting, but the quality and service balanced it out. n If you were to compare the prices from burger joints now a days, its not much    n  more expensive when you really think about it. The dollar menus is what makes n  up for their regular prices if you break it down. nnSmashburger Review Continuednn Our bill came out to about  after everything. Considering the quality, service, and options, its worth it. nn The Smashfries are tossed in olive oil and herbs, and given as an option for both regular fries and sweet potato fries. Cost a  more I believe than regular fries.  nn When you order a burger or chicken sandwich, the fries are NOT included and will need to be ordered separately. Cost is about  depending on if you choose regular or smashfry style. nnSmashburger would be great for all types of people, great for a casual dinner or lunch, and even better for a good place to grab some food and a beer without going to the bar. nnOverall experience was great, will definitely be going back very soon, and would recommend this place to anyone whose looking for a good burger or sweet potato fries. nnIf your NOT a cheapass, then you will definitely respect this place, but if your a person whose life is run by your money, instead of YOU running your own life, then this place is NOT for you!nnHope this helped. nnPlease leave comments or connect with me on facebook. nnUntil next time,nnAnthonynnPS If this smashburger review was helpful, please show some love!"
1,"What I look for in a gas station is good quality gas at the cheapest price.nnThis location has consistently been some of the lowest price gas in the valley since it opened last year. I use the GasBuddy app to locate the low price gas in my area. Again today, this location came up as the lowest in all of Phoenix at the moment. Cheaper than even ARCOs that I avoid because I prefer to use a credit card. nnI have used QT gas since I started driving in Iowa. I have never had a problem.nnIt is also conveniently located just off the  at Thomas Road."
1,"This place is kind of hard to get to. We wandered around for a while before we found it. Nevertheless I was desperate to try it, even though I heard it wasnt as good as the one on the wine country.nnWe came for brunch, and as all girlie brunches start, we began with bellinis. Good sparkling wine with peach puree. It was brunch, but my like minded ladies wanted to try the oysters here and they were the quality kind, not too oversized and lacking that fishy flavor.nnThen between us we ordered the croque madame, french toast, and the piece de la resistance... chicken and waffles! Can you believe Bouchon has a version of chicken and waffles? I blinked twice in disbelief looking at this menu item. nnEverything was not bad, and the service was impeccable. The runny egg on the croque madame was cooked to perfection, neither being too runny or too over cooked. The french toast came in a mini tower much to our surprise. We split it delightfully and the chicken and waffles, while not being fried chicken was roasted to a great savory moistness mixed with the sweet syrup and spongy waffle was a great nnAlso sitting outside on the patio right by the pool was fabulous, except for the fact that only older people sunbathe outside during brunch time... shudder"
1,Im glad there is a new addition to Mill ave that I can get down with. This little shop just opened so there wasnt a lot to choose from especially for the bigger gal. The four star review is for what they will hopefully become. There were some cute items and also a large section for men which is rare for vintage clothing stores. The staff was friendly especially Cory. Theres an extensive collection of vintage shirts that range from  to . Dresses about  each. Some items werent priced though since it just had a soft opening today. I hope this business does well and cant wait to come back once they have worked out the kinks.
1,"I really appreciated being able to call a little before the restaurant opened to order my pizza about  mins. I had to pick up and bring to a prek party so it had to be ready on time. Every employee that helped, both on the phone and while picking up were very nice and accommodating. The pizza was really delicious, everyone enjoyed it. This is definitely joining the pizza rotation, joining settebello as our favorite. It also looked like a nice atmosphere to dine in as well."
1,"Great lunch spot on Mill Ave!  Ive had tabbouleh, the chicken salad and the vegetarian plate  all have been spot on.  My coworkers also like the chicken donner and the kebabs.nnTwo drawbacks, though  First, its expensive.  Whenever you add chicken to a salad, they add ., which brings your bill up above .  Second, service isnt exactly speedy.  I realize that fresh, quality food isnt cheap and takes some time to make, but I have time constraints and a different price point for a work lunch.   stars."

1,Im extremely picky about Korean food since I have eaten it since birth and am particular about my Kimchi and traditional dishes. I came here at pm expecting to have late night staleness. Instead everything was fresh and delicious. Loved the ambiance and decor. It was very clean which is typical for Koreans . They played Korean music which was fun too. Service was GREAT! Food came quick and full portions. We stayed  hours since it was happy hour. Ill be back here ALOT!!!!!
1,I found The Specialist here on yelp and called in a relative state of panic. I had been at work and the office complex neglected to tell us they were painting part of the building. I ended up with a car covered in green paint specs. I called The Specialists and asked a series of questions about how to handle the situation  Theo was both patient and kind  he answered all my questions and told me to bring the car in so he could take a look at it. He was able to remove all of the paint in record time and I was back at work shortly there after. nnI recommended them to everyone in my office! nnThey are absolutely brilliant!
1,"The best chicken strip in townnSorry for the raisin cane, I tried both, but BFG is the best in town not you guysnAnd the owner of the BFG, Jin, is super friendly and super nice. The best thing about their customer service is they they remember all of their customers names really amazingnI went there all the time when i am studying at csn charleston campus"
1,"Oh crap.nnSo good. So good that I kept saying This is so good...so good... while I was allowing beautifully moist, perfectly grilled, and flavorful pieces of Filet Mignon dissolve on my tongue. This was in between happy bites of grill lobster,  rich and buttery.nnYes, this meal was a bit pricey   bucks from the Surf n Turf, but if I was gonna do it? I was gonna do it right. I recently started eating meat again, so we came to a Steakhouse. Sorry cows...nnAnyway  Service was great, the drinks were tasty, and the food was incredible.nnI recommend ending with the Creme Brulee Cheesecake for dessert, and starting with a well crafted cocktail.nnBoombastic fantastic!"
1,great thin crust pizza great vegan chicken wings! My dad ordered the pasta fagioli and roasted artichoke and he loved it! My brother ordered one of the pasta dishes and enjoyed it also. I ordered the gluten free margherita  another without cheese and it was great. Great vegan  gluten free options overall
1,Todays meal was fantastic. I had the Kung Pao chicken. The wife had Sweet and Sour chicken. Very fresh and flavorful! We always have a good meal here. nThe remodel of the dining room is great. nfour stars!
1,"I was sooo happy when they put a Rudys in Phoenix. Move here  years ago from Texas and could not find good BBQ in the state. nnA bit of a drive but, well worth the trip. The manager said more Rudys BBQ restaurants will open in the valley soon. Hopping for some the close. Too hot during the Phoenix summer to grille outside during the day."
1,"Pretty much the best gym there is in the Las Vegas area.  Top notch locker room, equipment, amenities, and service.  Multiple basketball courts that can be used for other activities as well.  Racquetball courts.  Indoor and outdoor pools.  For those with kids, it has child care services.  Its open .  If its within your budget and conveniently located this is the gym to join."
1,"Cosmos is one if my go to places for some affordable eats before an event or a show uptown. My girlfriends and I thoroughly enjoy the halfprice martinis on Wednesdays  my personal fave is the pineapple upsidedown martini. Mmmm tastes like cake! Who doesnt like cake in a glass? nnIve eaten a variety of dishes on the menu and each dish Ive had was both tasty and affordable enough to come back. Some of my favorites are the Fried Goat Cheese Salad, the Shepherd Pizza and Pasta Primavera. nnFor those adult beverage seekers, the bar can get crowded during happy hour and special event evenings. Im a fan of Cosmos bar crowd, as compared to its neighbors, this bar attracts a well behaved crowd of upper slate s. Not that I have an issue with a younger crowd, but Im just jiving with the cages, swings and gogo dancers next door. nnMake sure to note that Cosmos sports a limited menu on big event nights and offers half price apps from  pm. This is definitely a spot to make reservations during event nights!"
1,"Went here last week with a few friends... the food was GREAT! We started off with beautiful salads beet and field greens, which were very tasty. We got the halibut, scallops, and mushroom risotto for our main meals, and everyone loved it all. We also got the smores and carrot cake desserts, very good, but we agreed it was the least impressive part of the meal. The service was exceptional. Our waiter, Donovan, was very helpful and funny! nnI recommend going here as soon as possible  we cant wait to go back!!"
1,"Food was very good and reasonably priced. Staff is super friendly. Ordered my food to go because louder atmosphere of music playing and too many talking over it isnt my thing. In cooler weather, the patio seating will be awesome. Very tropical look and much quieter than indoor seating! Overall, real nice to grab a hamburger."
1,"Days Inn at Wild Wild West  Great Budget and Decent Inn Motel off the StripnnFor someone on a budget who did not want to pay at least double during my stay at other places, this Days Inn at Wild Wild West has to be one of the better MotelInn setups at  per night plus taxes give or take . fee per day.   nnPros vs ConsnnMine had the King bed with Plasma Screen and it looks like Days Inn took some time redoing the inside as it really looks like a decent hotel room in any great hotel.  The outside needs some work as it just looks like any old Motel but neat and tidy. The noise level is higher due to the fact that youre basically right off of Tropicana Blvd but its bearable.  nnThe registration area is a blast from the past as this dump reminds me of the s in either an outdated or rustic feel.  I actually wouldnt mind it if they only added just stainless steel accents as an easy way to upgrade an old area look with a balance of New and Old look and it actually may look great that way.  Youll notice the old Machines and old carpet right away. Its definitely not the Luxor or Bellagio, lol.  They give free coffee and breakfast with its integrated Dennys.nnThe downside has to be the SLOWEST WiFi I have ever experienced as I really needed WiFi for my stay here.  It states MBps, but the most I got was kbps to kbps download speeds.  Just HORRIBLE at this time and age although its free but again, the actual room is great.nnIf you can deal with the Motel exterior with a great interior with a little bit of noise, this is a great budget place to enjoy Las Vegas!"
1,"TI was great.  We matched with TI on Priceline for  a night, and figured it would be a terrible place because we got such a great deal.  Nope!  Everything was lovely.nnRoom The room was huge, modern, and beautiful.  We let the person at the checkin desk know that it was our anniversary, and they offered to upgrade us we got a corner room.  This is a very specific pro, but I really liked their bath soap.  It has bumps on it, so bathing was like getting a silky massage.nnHotel in general It was... okay.  The casino seemed smoky and not as open as other ones we saw.  The attraction, though the Sirens of TI show was a lot of fun.  The one thing that surprised me about the hotel was that they charge a daily service fee of .  I take it many Vegas hotels but not all do this.  They try to convince you that you get stuff for your , and I guess you do free wireless internet, a for buffet coupon that we used and enjoyed, a special screening area for the Sirens show... but still... it felt sneaky.nnLocation Wonderful.  This is considered the north part of the center of the strip.  So youre still in the middle of all the action, but youre not in the middle of the middle of the action.  We walked most everything though took a city bus to Freemont St, and thought TI was a great location for walking.  Theres also a Walgreens across the street, which means you can buy cheaper breakfast foods and snacks there."
1,"Great sports bar.  New, but has the feel of a place thats been around for awhile.  The quesadilla is good, and the sunday drink specials are great!  Thanks Thunder Dan for opening one of your joints in our neighborhood!"
1,The room and bathroom are huge! I love the big bathtub too. nThe pool area is also amazing because the swimming pool is huge. The drinks were a bit too pricey and the poolside service was slow. I will definitely be staying here for now on though.
1,"This was my first club in Vegas and it definitely makes SF clubs look like shiz. We got in through a promoter so the girls got in for free. The guys still had to pay which sucks but guys have to pay anywhere they go in Vegas. There was no celebrity DJ but this place was so popping. All i heard throughout the night was untz untz untz. It was pretty much EDM overload and since I am not a fan of that music, I had to force myself to appreciate it. It is definitely an experience I will never forget, especially since I came out of that place with huge blisters on my feet. Lesson learned girls, buy those foldy flats. They will save your life.nnI think that the overall venue at Marquee is soooo pretty and gorgeous. It is super crowded inside and you will get pushed and shoved around like at any Vegas club. What differentiates this place is the BEAUTIFUL outdoor patio where all the bottle service is. There are bars out there, lamps, tables, couches and little streams of water. The only negative is that there is no actual seating for people who dont have tables. The only thing you can do is sneak a seat on the dividers between tables and hopefully those people dont mind you sitting in their space. It beats XS where there are even fewer places to rest your feet. nnTIPSn Definitely check out this club and XS. Two different venues, same music and crowd, but this one feels a lot classier.n Girls, bring foldy flats. It is so tough to find places to rest!n Enjoy!"
1,"Yo G.  Kind vittles.  you know how to make some tasty food.  Chili cheese fries are seriously right on.  cheesesteaks are all good.  Confusing place though.  the menu, the ordering is all confusing.  Not always sure who is an employee, not always greated by anyone.  Should be asked if you have been here before or have any questions.  Good vittles"
1,"A dry martini, Bond said. One. In a deep champagne goblet.nn    Oui, monsieur.nn    Just a moment. Three measures of Gordons, one of vodka, half a measure of Kina Lillet. Shake it very well until its icecold, then add a large thin slice of lemon peel. Got it?nn    Certainly, monsieur. The barman seemed pleased with the idea.nn    Gosh, thats certainly a drink, said Leiter.nn    Bond laughed. When Im...er...concentrating, he explained, I never have more than one drink before dinner. But I do like that one to be large and very strong and very cold and very wellmade. I hate small portions of anything, particularly when they taste bad. This drinks my own invention. Im going to patent it when I can think of a good name.nn    Ian Fleming, Casino Royale nnPlaces everyone!  Cue lights, music. Roll cameras!  Mark!  Action!  After a brilliant birthday dinner at The Barrymore, we gravitated like a magnet to this bar.  Not as dramatic in ambiance as The Chandelier with all its bedazzled finery, the Vespar Bar is a bit more discreet with a clientele a little older, more mature, more sophisticated.  Well, maybe I speak for myself.  Theres a swankiness here that cannot be explained but only experienced.  Perhaps the name Vesper is meant to be a refrained whisper that sounds more intriguing each pass of the lips.  nnThe signature drinks here are phenomenal and brink on legendary.  Case in point being their Hot Mule Hanger One Spiced Pear, Housemade Ginger Syrup, Lemon, Angostura, Ginger Beer  Mint.  So best to order up, not down.  Explore the liquid artistry of the mixologists and challenge them to create a masterpiece rather than paint by numbers and pop open a can.  Faux pas is wearing Manolo and ordering Grey Goose with a can of energy you could easily buy at .  All dressed up and still ordering like a kid.  Our mixologists shakes his head and says to us, Wide awake and drunk.  No Manolo could class that drink up.  nnOooh Vesper, is that you at the corner bar stool?  Your platinum blonde hair, your deep blue lagoon eyes, luscious lips and hourglass je ne sais quoi.  Nope, just a very high end professional companion going for about hour. Im afraid Im a complicated woman, is what Vesper Lynd said in Casino Royal.  Oh, I have no doubt.   Just another actor on the stage of life, entertaining those still sober to care, sipping a crafty cocktail or three or four and taking in the scene.  No less, a great place to call it a wrap.nnHappy !"
1,"A friend and I had lunch at Kitchen  a couple weeks ago, well Im a BIG FAN!  I ordered the BurgerDeluxe , yes Im a huge burger snob, at any rate, I always judge a place by how they make or will make their burgers.  I ordered it Very Extra Rare...and Yes that IS exactly how it was served.  Our server said, and I quote, I told the chef that you indeed wanted it to only be introduced to the grill, not actually to date the grill.  How Perfect Was That???  It was just perfect and I was giddy the entire meal.  The service was not over agressive, just attentive. The balance of the meal consisted of my dining partner had the pulled pork.  She liked it a lot and would go back!  The onion marmalade on my burger was extremely note worthy.  Just the right balance of sweet without losing the onion flavor!  nnSo I say, Go Forth and Enjoy Kitchen .!.!.!..."

This is my favorite burger in Charlotte and one of my fav restaurants.nnI have a friend whos a head chef at another restaurant in south end and he was surprised to hear my thoughts, given the reputation that doesnt seem to be as good, and this reputation baffles me. Ive never had bad service, and definitely nothing but less than an excellent meal. Id dig my feet in against anyone who said otherwise. Anything less than  stars isnt doing the place justice"

The bulk items were a nice surprise as well.  I was able to indulge in some malted milk balls with peanut butter.  So yummy!nn Ive begun to appreciate Krogers overall for their pricing...the fact they ate getting more competitive in terms of esthetics and selection will keep me coming back.nnWork on that customer service thing and Ill give you a th star and my repeat business.nn  Thats an overall suggestionsome stores are better than others"
1,"Review   Veg Fried Rice  Red Braised Pork Street SandwichnnWe specifically went to this restaurant to try the  Veg Fried Rice . that was featured on Foodnetworks Best Thing I Ever Ate.  LOVED it!  I wish I could duplicate the sauce.  Big bowl, definitely feeds  as a main dish,  as a side.  My husband had the Red Braised Pork Street Sandwich  and he said it was very good.  Pricey though for a very small sandwich.  Still, the quality is outstanding and Id rather eat less and pay more for great food.  Bench style seating on community tables is hard on the back no back rests very sleek modern style  interesting ever changing graphics projected on the walls.  Id go back for the Veg Fried Rice and would like to try their other food.  Great quality!"
1,"Stopped in to see nd half of a football game and was VERY pleasantly surprised! Awesome space its HUGE! and plenty of TVs everywhere. Service was super fast and friendly, and their menu looks great looking forward to trying their food next time!.  Only downside was that a Smirnoff vodka was . WHAT?!. For Smirnoff??  Seriously people, were not in Manhattan, were in Mesa. Lets price the drinks appropriately.  Otherwise  thumbs up."
1,"Ive always wanted to visit Matties Diner and so this morning, I decided to take my son over after an airport run.  The diner is small with jukeboxes at the booths and lots of counter seating. It was so early on Sunday morning that finding a seat wasnt a problem.  He had the pancakes and I had a western omlet I think it was called a B.  The food was great.  Like a real diner, its all fresh and prepared right on the griddle just behind the counter.  They even made a smiley face in my sons pancake which was very cool.  Ive found my new uptown breakfast spot."
1,"Local, delicious eats from a food cart  Im a big, big fan. nnI FINALLY got a chance to stop by Harvest Moon Grille and sample some of their delectable lunchy foods. If youre unaware, HMG usually parks it literally somewhere around the TradeTryon vicinity and doles out great, quick food all made from local ingredients. They offer two  different dishes each weekday and one very fresh side item. They even have a map on their cart with push pins and little flags showing where your food came from. I love that!nnThey typically serve two different lunch options with a side for  each. If youre thirsty they offer a few different beverages  a flavored water fresca, bottled water or local soda. All delicious as well. When I walked over to the big orange cart and stood in line they were Chicken Carnitas with a slaw of cucumber, squash  zucchini dressed with their own tatziki, sprinkled with Ashe County cheddar  Late Summer Griddle Cakes  okra, onion and basmati rice bound with egg whites and fried in a delicious patty. Topped with pear chutney. The side for either choice was chilled bulgar salad with cucumber and tomato.nnI went with the Summer Griddle Cakes....mmmmmm. They were fresh and flavorful  especially with the pear chutney which was served on the side. The bulgar salad was a great, light accompaniment...perfect for summer. For two meals and two drinks it totaled .  a bit steep, but hubs and I are fine paying a little extra for all local ingredients. If youre super, duper hungry this may not be enough to satiate you just keep that in mind. The order takers are super nice and friendly  they are genuinely happy that you are lovin on their food. nnI adored Harvest Moon Grill and Im excited to go back and try another meal pronto."
1,"I have yet to hike any of the trails on this mountain without projectile vomiting. nnTried the Summit Trail the other day and seriously thought I was going to die. If you choose this route youre going to get dirty, and youre going to get confused. I also recommend wearing pants if you are as clumsy as I am, otherwise you will end up with  bruises, scrapes and a substantial sized gash that might require stitches because you WILL end up crawling at some point, unless youre a rock climber..... Or Jesus. Oh, and there are scorpions. I finally saw one in real life and almost shit my pants. nnPARKING SUUUUUCKS, especially on the weekends.. Also, ATT does not work here, shocking, so dont attempt this alone or without TONS of water unless you are an extremely experienced hiker. I certainly am not and It may be a while before I attempt this bitch again, because im pretty sure Camelback Mountain is trying to kill me."
1,"Overall, I like this place. The food was quite good and the place is nice and feels very open with all the window.  I dont like having to stand in line for  minutes. I understand why they went with this seating arrangement. If a place is crowded all the time this allows people to get through faster. However, I find it hard to justify standing for that long. There are very few places where I would stand in line Disneyland style for a meal. XOXO in Chicago is worth the wait sometimes standing for an hour. This place may not be. I would only come back in the off hours. Ok, rant over.nnThe food I had the diablo burger and added a fried egg and bacon. Very good. Far spicer than I would have guessed. My little dude had a plain cheese burger. Most of which he rubbed on his face then threw on the floor. He did seem to like it though. My lady had the ahi burger which she stated was really good. We all enjoyed the truffle fries.nnGreat food, good beers, nice place, prepare to stand for a bit. Worth checking out."
1,"This is a realtime review. nnUpon entering we were greeted with a warm and friendly welcome by Josh! The decor in this place is really cute. Its a little small inside but thats no ones fault. This place definitely makes you forget youre in Vegas!nnWe had the Ribs, Lemongrass Soup, World Famous Spinach Salad, and the Citrus Steal Salad. nnAll were fantastic and definitely large portions for just being Tapas! Worth every . One of the best steak salads Ive had in a while."
1,Enjoyed this show.  Loved the tshirt!  Went with husband  found the material true to the differences between men  women.  Enjoyed the delivery  set.  Still can relate to huntergather stories.
1,"I can only agree with my fellow Yelpers  Noodlehead is one of a kind! The menu wont overwhelm you but they focus on the basics and they get it just right. nWe tried the See Yew with big, soft rice noodles, a very tasty sweet sauce, and your choice of shrimp or chicken. The flavor was fantastic and very distinguished. The other dish was Chiang Mai Curry with egg noodles, chicken, and some vegetables in a superb coconut sauce. The portions were decently sized and will fill you if youre super hungry take a starter. The spiciness level ranges from  to   I took  and it was already well spiced. Prices are okayish,  for a main dish. The food quality is great though and thats why Ill definitely come back here again.nnStreet parking can be tough on South Highland and  its cash only."
1,"So, for months I had been planning my weekend in Vegas.  Some friends were getting remarried at Cupids Wedding Chapel.  I had disaster after disaster happen on my way to vegas, and once I got everything sorted, I needed some me time.  I researched Nail Salons on Yelp, and drove to All Star Nails.nnI was so happy I wanted to cry  when I walked in, the man who was working there asked me How can I take care of you?  let me just say, the airline that screwed up, the rental car company that screwed up and the hotel that screwed up none of them asked me that.  This man knows the service industry  I already added money to his tip and I had just sat down.nnClean shop, lots of space, nice pedicure chairs.   All in all, a great, well priced manipedi.  I was sitting next to a stripper the Olympic Garden is next door and guess what  strippers know personal hygiene.  If you are even in need of a moment of pampering while you are in vegas  all star nails is an inexpensive option. My . hours prepared me for an amazing weekend.  Ill be writing reviews..."
1,"My favorite bar. Great staff, good food...AWESOME wings!!! I always tell people to go here. I hadnt been in a couple of mths and when I went in again, they had remodeled and made it more open. Love it!"
1,The night didnt start off well at the old fashioned.  We had a . to  hour waiting time.  The restaurant calls your table by texting your cell phone.  For some odd reason they the restaurant could not get the message to send to us.  After waiting for about . hours for our table I decided to go check how long it would be before our number was called.  They had bypassed us because of the cell phone problem.  After we were finally seated we order a few beers which were great.  We also ordered the bratwurst appetizer which was amazing.  For my main course I had the bacon Mac and cheese and it was terrific.  Minus having that little mess up with our table not getting called everything else tasted so great.  Suggest to everyone to try this place out but recommend going on a less busy night.  The university of Wisconsin was having family weekend that night.  Great food though!!!!!!
1,Amazing food. nVery friendly. Our server even brought us soup before we ordered just as a welcome. This place is just wonderful. My husband and I were in town and had a craving for some pad thai and he found this little place on Yelp. The sheer number of positive reviews had our mouths watering and we were not disappointed. The food and pricing were perfect for us. Everything was served fresh and quickly. It was a good family made meal. We are going to be in Vegas this next weekend and cannot wait to go back and visit!
1,"Life in the Suburbs is lot different than the famous Strip away from the Night Clubs, which are traps, established by Venture Capitalists, to part the money from the tourists mostly unsuspecting Japanese tourists, for promises of paradise, that was never deliveredonly the paradise rd.  When you are driving North on Durango and just before Sahara, you notice an ordinary looking Greek Cafe and the lure of the Gyro entices you to go in. When you are in you realize this is not a Cafe but a Greek Palace. The ornate and classy furnishings reminds you of  Caesars Palace off the Strip. The Aegean Aesthetics is pleasing and soothing.nnThen you see if the food matches the decor. In my opinion of all the Greek places I have eaten...Yes. The gyro is a culinary invention  like the Chicken Tikka and Pizza. A vertical spit that is openly displayed at other cheap Greek places like the rotating spectrum in barber shops is hidden.  It is the best gyro I had, other than Nicks Gyro on Touhy and Harlem, in Park Ridge, Illinois. The Gyro is well done, the pita bread crisp not soggy, right amount of onion and the zatiziki sauce...oh the sauce. How did mankind exist without this sauce? The taste is just out of this world specially gulped down with a Greek red wine not beer beer tends to fill you up and takes where as a chilled red wine before and during the meal is better for the digestion. The other item I tried was Chicken and Lamb Kebabs. The only other place I have had that kind of kebabs was at Marrakesh on Paradise Rd. They even have belly dancers on last Wednesday of the month with a Variety Dinner Show. Cant beat this place for the money and the ambiance.nnThe portions are huge and the food is as fresh you can get and is is fast. The bar which is one of the best stocked bars has video machines and assortment of world beers. The service can be spotty at times but if you are not in hurrywhich is a shamewhen you are dining in a classy place like this. They even have a gazebo."
1,"Muy delicioso! Ive driven thru several times and each visit has left me happier than the last. nnBrushfire offers a wide selection of tacos, each with specialized toppings. I swoon for the adobado pork, which includes juicy bits of pineapple, spicy peppers, and cotija cheese in a flour tortilla. If you want corn tortillas instead, ask. nnOther tacos include chicken, carne asada, shrimp, and veggie, which has roasted peppers, red potatoes, mushrooms, and other bits. Tacos can also be upgraded to burritos, bowls, or added to a flight. nnFlights include your entree, fresh chips and your choice of five fresh salsas, a tapas and drink...and they not only have coke zero, they also have decent unsweetened iced tea. nnTapas options seem smaller recently, but are still crunchy bliss. I love the shrimp, like the croquetas and empanadas, and havent tried the roasted potatoes. nnService is speedy and super friendly. This is a eat in the car sort of place, so ask for extra napkins and just relax. You may just want to drive thru again for churros or flan."
1,"Just got back from lunch after church on Sunday. It tells you something when the place is packed and people are waiting outside.nThis place is a gem in a fast food world populated primarily by chains serving the same ol stuff. This is a legitimate neighborhood eatery churning out food not found anywhere else...yahoo for diversity.nThis was my rd time back and I had never tried the pizza muffins and decided to give them a shot. Oh baby, an order of those and a salad is a GREAT meal! Unfortunately I ordered a calzone to split with my wife....too much food! But, was it ever good!nEverything has that handmade, mom and pop look ...and taste...to it which is delightful.nI may even go back for Senior night if I can find one of the BOGO coupons out there.nDefinately a place to put on your dining experience list. Highest praise!"
1,"Went back to this place because some friends wanted to go for fish fry.  Got to saythey do a nice fish fry.  The cod was excellent, the hashbrowns were solid, and the roll was your standard hard dinner roll, but it was nice.  The coleslaw was weird, though. It was very sweet not my favorite sort of slaw.  The price was good, the beer specials were nice, and the waitress was very good.  All in all, I cant complain.nnI do need to speak about their fried cheese curds, though.  nnI have no idea what sort of cheese comprised them.  It wasnt a standard cheddar.  They were waxy and weird, sort of like a cross between a processed cheese and cheddar.  They coated them in a thick batter that was overly spicy, probably to compensate for the weird curd taste.  nnAll in allsome of the worst curds Ive had around this fair state of ours.  Id go back for the fish, but skip the curds."
1,My son has been going here since he was  months old.  Yeah they get sick sometimes but what kid doesnt?   I enjoy the environment and staff and I know my soon to be  year old does too!  MGM and CCLC has made it easy and convenient for MGM employees to have their children taken care of.
1,"MAKE YOUR OWN SHAKES, SAY WHAAA?! Bomb.com. Went here for lunch and they are packed. I can see why. Theres was a  minute wait, but it was most definitely worth it. The person I was with order the veggie burgervery inexpensive  still good, the jalapeufo appetizer, fries, onion rings, and their special burger burger. Wow, best  burger I have ever had and Ive had Gordon Ramsay BURGR. Most def recommend if ur willing to spend  on a burger and shake!"
1,"My gf has been wanting to try Tableau since her last visit to Vegas and this time around she said shell treat my parents and me to brunch there.  My entire experience was very good except for a couple of minor blimps.nnWhen I called in to make the reservation the ladys tone of voice, personality, friendliness is what epitomizes Wynn.  I have never stayed at their hotel but that experience there tells me why they won the five diamond award.  The reservationist was polite, friendly, and just made sure to cover points that I would never have even thought of and best of all she got me excited about dining there.nnUpon arriving we arrived right on time our table wasnt ready and we waited for  minutes.  Even though they apologized a few times when we were seated I would have appreciated if they told us at the ten minute mark why the table wasnt ready or at least update us.  The only things we were told werejust a moment and we are working on it.  nnFor brunch we ordered the scrambled eggs with duck and puff pastry, eggs with elk, a traditional breakfast with eggs, toasts, bacon, a pastrymuffin basket, and a tofu napoleon.  I cant comment on the tofu but my mom liked it a lot.  The traditional breakfasts muffin basket was delicious.  It came with strawberry jam, what seems to be orange zest, and something similar to devonshire cream.  The elk and the eggs were disappointing.  The elk was just a piece of meat patty that wasnt very good.  The scrambled eggs on both dishes elk and duck were a bit runny for my taste.  The duck and egg was decent but as I said it would have been better if the scrambled eggs werent as runny.nnService is excellent.  They have notes ready for the waiters so they address you as Mr. or Ms. or Mrs. so and so.nnThe ambiance in the restaurant is terrific.  On a sunny day its like sitting inside a open window conservatory with the garden and pool right outside.  While the views can be nice, it can also be negated by out of shape men wearing their swim trunks walking around and talking on the phone.nnThis is a place you should try and Ill most definitely come back again."
1,"I wasnt offered the extra smoothie at the bottom of the blender.  I would have given this place  stars if they did.  I dont like seeing food go to waste, especially something as delicious as their smoothies!"
1,"Great service, happy hour and food! I was in Vegas for  days, had dinner here twice. I dont remember the bartenders name but he remembered me when I came in, staff was making it a fun casual atmosphere. I will be back anytime I am in the area!"
1,"Surprised so many are quick to discount a place that you can get a full meal for . Yes your chicken wasnt handed to you by a hipster in a barn that was upgraded with modern lighting and a DJ playing, but for what you pay for, Canes is awesome. If you want fried chicken fingers these have to be some of the best. nnTo clarify for some of the others, a burger king used to be here and they welcomingly bulldozed down that atrocity to burgers to the ground. And they do have modern lighting, and a disco ball for some reason, if that is what youre into."
1,"I live in Chandler and they closed down my local Souper Salad.  I was sooo incredibly sad as this was one of the weekly places I visited!!  The closet thing we have is a Sweet Tomatoes... I popped in once in hopes that it would be somewhat similar.  Never going back again.   Fortunately, I discovered the Souper Salad Superstition location which is near my friends home.  I will definitely be frequenting this place!  P.S.  Please come back to Chandler!"
1,"Its  on a Saturday night in downtown Phoenix and the boyfriend and I are hungry.  Thai food sounds good but one of my biggest issues with Phoenix restaurants is that they close too early.  You are lucky if you can find anything opened past pm.  I think I remember that Thai ESan is opened until  but I am not sure why I think that.  nnI have never been to this restaurant but I hear good things and have wanted to check it out for a long time.  We get to the restaurant and check the hours. They close at .  I hate getting a table at the last minute as I dont want to hold up the staff that have been there all day long and know that they want to go home.  I turn around to get back in my car when a nice lady comes out and asks us to come in.  Well, with that warm welcome, how can I refuse?  nnWe get seated in a comfortable window booth and look at the menu.  It is big with the usual menu items that one would expect at a Thai restaurant.  We start with Thai iced tea . the perfect drink for a hot Phoenix evening.  We then ordered the chicken Satay . Seemed high priced until the dish arrived.   large servings of grilled chicken breast perfectly grilled, served with cucumber salad and peanut sauce.  For our main dishes we both were in the mood for curry.  We tried both the Royal Curry, yellow curry in coconut milk, potato, onion and carrot . and the salmon green curry, coconut milk, bamboo shoot, green beans, Thai eggplant and Thai herbs .  Both servings were Tasty, although too large for us to finish but that did not stop us from ordering the Sticky Rice with Mango . nnThe service was exceptional as the staff treated us like family.  One warning, if you do not like your dishes spicy, do not order past a one star."
1,As good as it gets! I was so thrilled to find a columbian restaurant close by where I work. The food was excellent. I ordered the Bandeja Tipica Colombiana but got aside instead of the shredded meat. There was so much food I had the rest for dinner. Everything was tasty and fresh. The staff was very attentive. We will be going back.  thumbs up!
1,"Cant say enough good things about these guys. This was my first time ever hiring a moving company. I actually found this company on Yelp and there wasnt a single bad review. Now I know why. Steve, John and Cameron showed up  minutes before my appointment time which was great. They use that time to go over paperwork and take a tour of the house and see what you have to move so they can make a plan. Then the time clock starts. I appreciated that. You arent being charged until the actual moving process begins. These guys are pleasant and professional. Super efficient but very careful with your items. They carefully wrapped all my furniture. They come fully prepared with all the equipment needed. Steve noticed that I still had all my clothes hanging in my closet and offered to bring up  wardrobe boxes from the truck for me to use at no extra charge. I will highly recommend the guys at Christopher Moving. Please make sure and tip them in cash as there is no way to add a tip on to the credit card when they take that information at the end."
1,"Its about time I write a review for Malees!  After all, Ive been more times than I can count... in addition to the Yelp event which was fantastic, Ive been to Malees in large groups, small groups, and solo.  Ive also done takeout various times including tonight!  nnI love the Desert Ridge location because they have sushi in addition to a really large thai menu.  Its great because you can order edamame, seaweed salad, or sushi appetizers and then get a thai entree... or you can get a thai appetizer and sushi dinner.  Im a big fan of mixing and matching!  I also like that Malees is open to substitutions in dishes if necessary.  Some of my favorite thai appetizers are the siamese kisses and summer rolls.  I also enjoy the pad thai, and all of the vegetarian options.nnAs of tonight, I have a new favorite dish at Malees... the thai basil curry clam house special.  Its a mouthful, but its awesome!  I ordered it with medium spice and had them add veggies.  Wow.  Phenomenal!  I was happy it came with rice your choice of white or brown because I sopped up the broth with the rice... and I have to admit, I thought about drinking the extra broth too  it was that good!nnService is usually great and everyone is friendly at Malees.  By far the BEST thai food in the area, and the best restaurant in the Desert Ridge shopping mall.  The only suggestions I have are these  please add an eggplant entree or at least allow me to add eggplant to the dish I choose to order, and perhaps a thai garden salad with peanut dressing.  Other than that, Malees rocks and still supports my theory that I was thai in a past life.  See you again soon, Malees!"
1,"I took my  year old daughter to HTC to have a tragus piercing about  months ago. I love this place!!! Yes, I was a little scared to let her get the piercing since she had had a cartilage piercing on the top of her ear that we eventually had to take out because it was so swollen and gross. But all of the staff were extremely knowledgeable and made it a point to let my daughter know SHE was responsible for the aftercare. They gave her detailed explanations every step of the way during the piercing and detailed instructions for aftercare. A few weeks ago we needed the front of the earring replaced so it would not be visible for volleyball. We went in and they checked it out...scolded her a little cause they could tell she wasnt still soaking it and told us to come back in a week or two when there was no swelling. Again they went over proper care!! I really appreciate the attitude that if the kid is old enough to get the piercing they need to be kept accountable for the proper care. I HIGHLY recommend HTC!!!"
1,"IT IS OFFICIAL.... I HAVE AN OVEREATING PROBLEMnnBefore we get to the light bulb point, lets step back and set the scene.nnId been recommended this place by some colleagues who have been to Madison a lot for work. We looked it up and found there were a few locations for the group so we picked here as it was closer to Verona where we were staying and we thought wed be able to park easier than near the capital we were right there was a free car lot across the street.nnWe walk in and its packed! Thursday night and we were told it would be a min wait for a table for ! But they said if we could find room at the bar or the high top tables we could just sit. So we hovered and almost left but I was thinking if its this busy we really have to try it! We got super lucky and found a high top table and were set. We got our hands on the menu which was in the style of an old newspaper cool! and the menu was huge! We struggled to pick.... until I saw the fried chicken with shrimp, andoille sausage, artichoke and mushrooms with a side of mashed potatoes and jalapenos and seasonal veggies ... with a name like smothered and covered fried chicken it pretty much sums up an almost perfect meal for me.... sold! As I was ordering I was telling myself.. diet start tomorrow, diet starts tomorrow... salad only for the next week!nnFood arrives... of course as expected large serve... and it is great. Chicken is crunchy fried and the toppings work well and the jalapeno mashed potatoes are great... a really nice spice that went well with the chicken.nnNow to the official fatso moment.... the waitress comes over and sees my empty plate... it must not be a common occurrence as she looks over and audibly says wow and gives me a HIGH FIVE!... oh the shame... Diet starts tomorrow, diet starts tomorrow.nnIve said it before and Ill say it again, dam you America and your delicious food!!!!!!!!"
1,"I was very pleasantly surprised at how nice this pub is. Its roomy, the seating is set out nice for relaxing and chatting. Relaxed atmosphere with a mixed crowd in it. Leith prices with an uptown feel. The bar staff were excellent, polite and attentive. I would definitely go back."
1,Huge thanks to all the cool people over at the HiLiter for an awesome time during my best friends bachelor party!!! We had a large group and the staff at the HiLiter treated us right from start to finish!
1,This place is great.  I just dined there and had the RITA  a garlicvodka cream sauce with penne pasta and a bowl of wedding soup.  BYOB!  The bar next store has basic beer stock so bring your own wine.nnThis is excellent Italian cuisine and inexpensive.nnIts intimate seating with butcher paper lining the tables.  The staff was fun  this includes the owner.nnThere are  small cafe tables outside in front of the place.  Tonight there were  tables outside with diners  this brick road had very little traffic.  The place was nearly empty when I got there at  PM but began to fill by .
1,"Gotta love this place. I discovered it about four weeks ago based on a recommendation from a coworker. I was in the mood for a good deli, somewhere that treated the art of sandwich making seriously. nnI found it. nnSince my first visit, rest assured, Ive eaten there about  times. Tried a few different things, but their calzones, pizza, sandwiches, pastries, pasta salads, and breads are all amazing. nnUnfortunately, they could really use some help on the customer service side. Theyve had a sign on the door since my first visit looking for help, but as you can imagine, good help is hard to find. Plus, you cant just hire anyone that could possibly treat the food as well as they do. Its obviously more than business at Belfiores, its passion.."
1,"Came here for dinner on Saturday night. Didnt have reservations, but we were seated within  minutes it was past pm. Silly me  I didnt know about the outside patio, since we came in from the other side. Oh well, next time. So we ended up sitting inside, which was actually better for me, since it was still  ndegrees outside. nnThings do happen fast here and I did appreciate it. Water was served to us within a minute of seating, loaf of bread within  minutes. Its cute how they bring out the bread  warm and wrapped in a paper sleeve like it just came from the bakery. Dinner came out in what seemed like less than  minutes  wow! I ordered the Chicken Grandmere  the chicken was cooked perfectly and was delicious mixed with the mashed potatoes, bacon and mushrooms. I just had to savor every bite! Veruka had the Carmelized Sea Scallops. The scallops literally melted in your mouth! She must have liked it because there wasnt a scrap of food left on her plate after a few minutes! We were just about to skip dessert, when I noticed that bread pudding was on the menu, specifically, White Chocolate Bread Pudding. That is one of my weaknesses, so I had to try it and I wasnt disappointed! Perhaps I should have eaten it a little slower, so I could prolong the experience, but Veruka was complaining that she was tired and wanted to go home. It was a good dinner, and a good way to end the night. Wait staff was pretty attentive and friendly, although I have to admit, I couldnt understand a lot of the stuff that they were saying. Yeah, well come here again!nnJust a note to myself my new favorite beer is Samuel Smith Oatmeal Stout."
1,We have tried this spot a few times and each visit we find just enough we like to keep coming back.  The whitefish on bialy is a favorite and the selection of bagels is extensive.  Try an oversized sandwich with a vanilla phosphate... All wonderful.  The only downside is that most items are  and that adds up for a family of .
1,"My girls and I have been going to Kandy for almost  years.  Curls, long extensions, bleached layers, we have it all! We feel like the luckiest girls on the planet to have Kandy, and the team at Snapdragon tending to our hair needs.  If Kandy moved to Tucson, or California, we would be going to Tucson or Callifornia every  weeks to get our hair done!  Kandy is by far the most talented colorist we have ever met, and her cutting techniques are amazing.  It isnt often that you can go into a hair appointment, close your eyes and relax, and know that you will look amazing when you leave.  Kandy and the staff are beyond accommodating, and the salon is always full of happy clients.  There is a good reason Kandy is booked up weeks in advance.  Shes is well worth the wait.  I could go on and on about how much I love all the people in the salon, but that aside, we return again and again because Kandys talented eye for color, honest ideas, and awesome cutting skills keep us coming back for more!"
1,"First time at this brand new establishment. We had a group of ten and were treated very wonderful. It wasnt very busy which surprised us all that some of the rolls took so long to come out, but as soon we notified our waitress she immediately took care of it. The food was amazing and the staff was just as amazing. The music is dancy it wasnt too loud but if that bothers you it might not make for a good ambiance experience for you and they have kung foo on tv awesome. I would definitely hope for this place to thrive."
1,"I havent had their sandwiches but had to post a review based on the Gourmet Fries. nnIn a word Awesome!! nnThere are five options of Gourmet Fries from which to choose Original, Cheddar, Cheddar and Bacon, Ranch and Bacon or Cheddar, Ranch and Bacon. I was looking for a light snack to hold me over until dinner and hour and a half later, so I bought the Cheddar and Bacon. Oh, I have butterflies in my stomach just thinking about how good this was. Yeah, its the processed cheddar cheese and those bacon bits are certainly processed. But Im not going to a mall eatery to find something authentic. Whats tops is, I was able to get my fries to go so I could carry them with me to Sallys where Bas bought hair color that bitch is younger than me and always points it out, but is going grey already. Afterwards, we walked through WalMart where I chowed down on those fries. One would think no one has ever seen a white boy eat cheese laden fries judging by the looks we were getting. The best part was the cashiers expression as I was shovelling forkfuls of fries into my mouth as Bas was buying laxatives. Priceless!"
1,"I love My Mothers! I used to be all about their chicken fried chicken but I have moved on to their turkey pot pies. Both are sooo good.  Oh and their coconut cream pie is delicious! The reason I am writing this review is because I am currently craving a My Mothers turkey pot pie but unfortunately they are closed this late at night. But another plus is that they deliver.  Overall, great place and fantastic food. Highly recommend."
1,"Their slogan says it all  The Best Little Brewhouse in the West!  Terrif food!  Great service! Reasonable prices.  Nice combination.nnBeer is brewed onsite. Its ondraft,  they even have DRAFT RootBeer!  YUM!nnBTW, if you cant get  meals out of their Kobe beef burger, metinks youre eatin too much!   nnOnce, when the soupoftheday was lentil I love lentils in a tomato broth, it was so good, I had to order another bowl to take home it was great right outta the refrig!"
1,"I had passed by this swanky little spot many times on my way home from work and always wanted to try it. From the outside it just looked so inviting. But I never got around to it until my wife and I got married and needed a place to hold a wedding reception. We called Vogue and they were more than accommodating in helping us put this event together! And it was all for free. They let us basically rent out the sweet patio and which is very nicely set up with a fire place, heat warmers, and privacy shades. They even let is drop off the wedding cake and held it at the restaurant until we got there latter that evening. They made sure everything went off smoothly. They also had a nice sound system outside so I was able to dance with my wife to make everything official. Now the food is also very delicious! The menu slightly varies depending on whats fresh and whats in season. Which to me is awesome because you can always get something new there to try. They have a nice bar inside and the decor is very classy and elegant. A true gem in the middle of the desert! I would recommend anyone wanting something good and fresh to eat to defiantly go here. The prices are also very fair."
1,"Its a tradition to sit out on the out door patio of Fatburger located right on the Las Vegas strip, dead center of all the craziness. At night they have bartenders who flare and  play good music like Kaskade and similar artist that makes you want to get your food and fuel for the next party. During the day its just a nice shaded spot  which I can personally hang out at for hours until the sun goes down. The food is excellent but do not expect any healthy alternatives if you are watching your weight but who can stay on a diet while on vacation in Vegas, what is the point? The inside of Fatburger is for the families with childern to help shield them from the drunks and exposed bodies that walk the strip. I have only walked through to use the restroom ...which is a disaster but you win some you lose some."
1,"So many yogurt places so little time,  especially when its hot outside. This place is tiny but they have good tasting yogurt. The toppings are just ok, they could be better organized or displayed in a more appealing fashion. Now that I think about it I dont even know what the price was per ounce. They didnt give me a receipt and I didnt ask for one oh well, shame on me."
1,We just had lunch here and it was delicious!  I had the BJG Burger with the Dixie Stix and the burger was great and the fries dixie stix were amazing!  Not your ordinary country bar here people.  The Mack and Cheese looked really good too so I might try that next time.  I wanted to get the Peanut Butter Ice Cream Sandwich but I was too full.  I work in Downtown Chandler and must say this was a great quick lunch with great service as we were in and out within the hour.
1,"A Fox concepts restaurant group restaurant, Ive eaten at this restaurant many times n enjoy the seasonal changes. Some things are better than others but overall this is a nice spot. It also has the best location in the Scottsdale quarters in my opinion, I love the patio in the back by the green grass mole hills and palm trees. Very Scottsdale! Great place to eat before or after a movie at Ipic.  My favorites on the menu are, the salads!! especially Tuscan kale and the hummus..."
1,not your average Irish pub... on the weekends it can get packed... and upstars they have a DJ or band and it can get a lil crazy... on big nights it is hard to move beacuse of so many pople but i guess it is like that everywhere in CLT... i have never eaten there food... but have heard it is ok...
1,"I used to believe that you could get everything at Wally World, but thats not the case. nnSports Authority carries higher quality products at a reasonable price.  This location is no exception.  I love their sales and have bought quite a few things from them in the past few months.nnThe employees here are really friendly and answer any questions you may have.nnThe store is nicely organized, clean and it is easy to find whatever youre looking for.  I sometimes come here with my friend to loiter for a while after lunch... but then end up buying something!nnIf youre looking for work out equipment, clothes, camping stuff or something for an active sport  give this place a try!"
1,"Favorite bar! Always up to try new places and venture out of comfort zone and this was definitely the gem to find. Tender was nice, atmosphere was fun, and throw back board games while enjoying happy hour? Sold. Will be back soon"
1,"Gates  Brovi is no Sardine, nor is it Marigold Kitchen.  But, with the success of those excellent establishments behind it, this neighborhood pub with family fare, is a sure bet.  In the month since G  B opened, I have wandered down there about about a dozen times.  Am I related to the owners?  No, I am an area resident, who enjoys sitting at the bar with a great Bloody Mary and a basket of yummy cheese curds.  And the ranch dressing is not only something for the kiddies!  Sometimes Ill have the blue cheese burger, or the steamed shrimp, while watching young and old greet each in a warm and inviting atmosphere.   Any new restaurant merits a second visit, as it continues to fine tune its operation.  Gates  Brovi is no exception.  Perhaps Ill see you there."
1,"Clean, Fast, and Friendly! The store is clean and the employees are very helpful. Its nice to be approached at least once and asked if I need any help. This is my neighborhood store and I enjoy shopping in this store. The lines are short and if theyre long they arent for long. Its nice to see employees jumping on quickly to help. They value youre time at this store. Thanks!"
1,"Review actually . nnGREAT SERVICE!!! Try the chicken del sol, all options are possible vegetarian as far as I know. The garlic dip is amazing, the humus is just good not anything to write home about. Easy to have a healthy meal here and you ALWAYS have enough for leftovers!"
1,"It was an amazing show well worth the time.  I started off by falling down  stairs in the semi dark there as we were getting to our seats.  The gent asked if I was ok and radiod and I felt pretty embarrassed by it all, we sat down and the manager came over to ask if I would like an ice pack, very cool, Im sure they were worried I was going to sue, it was entirely my fault.   nnSoon after the show started I forgot all about that, the set was crazy and I cant tell you how good this show is you have to see it for yourself!   Ill try to summarize it but I might be wrong.  The scene sets up in an old run down theater and ghosts inhabit the place, the performers show up in color to differentiate from the ghosts and the acts are spectacular, I was in awe from start to finish.   nnRealtor Karl is correct, every seat has a clear view of the stage no matter were you sit.   You can buy these on the day of the event as we did, we went over to a discount ticket place near the fashion mall, very cool people there, saved us a ton of money, for  we got two tickets close to the stage and discount tickets to a buffet at the Monte Carlo."
1,Thanks to Brian and his crew...i had a awesome experience Today with my car. They were fast and efficient and my car was done in a timely manner!!!!! And love the tint job! Its gonna save us from the hot sun!!! Thanks again
1,"When I go out to eat, I rarely consider a Thai restaurant, just because everything I have had in the past is just okay. This is my go to from now on.  Its clean, fresh, and flavorful.  Kudos to the chef and staff.  I ordered the Pud Se Ew with chicken.  The veggies were not overcooked, the spicy was perfect and I was surprised at the level of presentation.  I will definitely be back!"
1,"The space is absolutely lovely, with simple colors, heavy wooden beams, some light industrial touches, and cozy nooks toothere are farm tables and tables with lake views. The food was lovingly prepared and I had the salmon which was perfectly grilled and served with delectable mushrooms and smoky lentils. The mussels came in a cream sauce that we soaked our bread inyum! Great cocktails and service, too. Dont hesitatejust go."
1,"Truly memorable. We had the Valentines Day menu offering for the whole weekend. I wasnt sure about some of the courses and was a bit surprised they didnt offer the main menu, but I stretched my palate and found there was nothing to worry about everything was cleanly presented and full of complex flavors. nnIt was five courses for  starting with an amuse bouche of a single oyster, with mango ? and salt simple and lovely and got our taste buds ready for more. nnnd course  snow crab with apples topped with a thick sour cream foam HEAVEN. It was accompanied by tiny potato chips charming. Hubby had the lamb tartar now, I dont like lamb in general, but I took a bite, and had to completely change my feelings it was luscious and divine. If I didnt absolutely love my snow crab, I would have devoured his!  nrd course I had this amazing bacon wrapped scallop with a foam sorry I cant remember what it was! with celery delicately strewn about the plate. Hubby had a miss, unfortunately it was a game meat soup ? with attractive curly pastas encased in a puff pastry. The flavors were very mild, but the soup was thin and had no actual game in it. The pastry was flaky, but when disassembled, would fall into the soup and make it soggy. nth course we shared the lobster risotto which was made with the knuckles and surrounded by the tail and claws. Beautiful presentation and it came with assorted colored carrots that were simply prepared, yet full of flavor French country cooking at its best. nth course by this time, I was stuffed! I had the fruit salad, which was a very original interpretation of your grandmas fruit salad. Cut into tiny pieces and topped with a frozen I want to say mango, but I cant be sure maybe passion fruit? It slowly melted as you ate it and it was lovely. Also had a couple of very small broken meringue cookies interspersed throughout. Hubby had the chocolate cake with what I think was a raspberry sorbet. It also had a small dollop of a light white sauce, but honestly, I took a only small bite because I was going to explode. In a good way, of course!nnEntire meal took about   hours this was both a good and bad thing for us. I know, Im a stupid American I own up to it, but felt hungry throughout until the lobster and then  bites and I was suddenly stuffed! and was always trying not to eat all the bread between courses. My American style way of eating out expects to have one course after another which, when you think about it, is pretty gross. It was nice in a way to have the advantage of lingering, but I fear I ate, not quickly, but certainly not at a snails pace. I blame my frustration on the slow service solely on me. Sit! Relax! Smoke a ciggy in between courses! Enjoy!"
1,"Very customer friendly. My inlaws have gone through LEE for years, then for my husband and his sister, and now Im going there too.  He usually has some of the best prices, and unlike most places, they do the glasses in store! You might have to wait a couple hours or a day, but no where near the waiting time if you were to go to a place like Nationwide Vision who I used to go to.  They are very knowledgeable and are concerned about what you need."
1,"BEST WORKOUT EVER!nnI consider my self in somewhat decent shape, I do  days of cardio  mins but this class kicked my ass! Its all body work and we used  lbs weights and my arms killed. Ive never had my body shake so much from working so hard.nnI was hurting but the good deep work out burn for  days after my first workout. I cannot wait to join and do this as an alternative to my current workout. It has been the best workout Ive done in a long while.nnthe people were friendly, the hour went by super fast, nobody was rude, they were helpful, I was probably one of the younger girls there but there were older ladies, which gave me a boost. Its tough so its not for the weak!! great music to workout to as well.nnI bought there  new client unlimited, which is a great deal already because it pays for it self in benefits and after  classes!! I totally cannot wait to be there almost everyday!!"
1,Sen of Japan is a neighborhood gem! If you are lucky enough to live or pass by this area often you have to stop into Sen. Youll become a regular for sure. nnThe quality of the fish that you will find here is outstanding. The food is also prepared very well. Ive never walked out of this place unsatisfied.nnThe ambiance of the restaurant is somewhat romantic...the lighting is dim and the music puts you at ease...perfect to where you can hear the other party but not have to constantly be conversing to avoid awkward silences. nnMy favorite item on the menu is the Black Cod Miso with Foie Gras. The dish is just delicious! The sauce is so addicting!!! Sweet but not too sweet where it overpowers the fish...I found myself dragging the last piece all over the plate to make sure that I had every last drop. nnTheir desserts are also amazing. They serve Bubbies mochi icecream which is a popular brand that comes from Hawaii !! Their chocolate souffle with green tea ice cream is a must try for those who love chocolate!! The souffle is made to order and served hot fresh out of the oven. Out server always suggests this to us while we are ordering our main dishes so they they could get a head start.  It is perfectly gooey and lava like on the inside and crisp on the outside like a delicious souffle should be.nnnThey also had a wide variety of Sake to choose from if you enjoy that with your meal. Overall the service is fantastic. The food is impeccable. Sen of Japan just does it right. nnn happy hour!!!
1,I tried Gannon for the first time and was very happy with the entire process from making my appointment to the finish of my complete car detail. They came to my house and spent almost  hours making my car look great.  I had the complete car package and my engine looked brand new and my car is  yrs old.  I will use them again without hesitation.
1,"I initially thought it was good but maybe not great when I first tried it but found myself going back and trying the pork instead of the beef and that is when I connected with this place. They cook the pork in a one of those rotating gyro meat cookers with a whole pineapple on top, with the outer skin removed so the pineapple juice continually bastes the outer layer of meat as it cooks. I had the burrito with pork and that was great and then...I tried the torta, that lovely Mexican sandwich. It was on this great, fresh, soft torta bread with a layer of guacamole, not to thick, and then a layer of pork, enough to provide a taste, but not too thick. I loved it! I also like their mexican corn, though it is a bit messy and I have only had it once, since you eat it right off the cob, sprinkled with white queso cheese. nnSo, a reliable place for a quick lunch. The prices seem a bit high for what they offer but...I keep coming back so they must be reasonable. I think that basically they are more of a quality than a quantity place, which is a nice thing to see in a place essentially offering fast food but not junk food like at many corporate fast food joints. Try it out, I dont think you will be dissapointed."
1,"I was originally attracted to this place by the bright color scheme, chic decor, and relaxing music. It seemed like a nice place to have lunch. Many such places use this as a ruse, then dont deliver on the menu. No so at Distrito. Everything we ordered was delightful. We started off with their fresh, crisp tortilla chips and a thick and chunky as it should be guacamole. Excellent. Then there was the ceviche the lemon sorbet they put on top added a nice texture and perfectly complimented the dish. nFor an entree, I had the carnitas and my friend had the mahi mahi fish tacos. Both were exquisite. I was impressed by how they took simple dishes and tweaked them slightly to create something altogether new and exciting.  This was a great lunch experience. I hope to return here soon."
1,"Stopped in here for some drinks after some shopping and was SUPER impressed with the beer selection at this place! They have a HUGE selection you are bound to find something to fall in love with here. I love going to places and being able to try a new beer that i have never had before and even better they had one of my favs that is really hard to come across...double score!!nninside and outside seating, bar seating as well. Did not eat during this visit but i did look over the menu and they had a lot to choose from and some things did catch my attention.nni will be back !"
1,"I guess if I had to compare this place to something, it would be Paradise Bakery, but with some differences.  For one, I like that their combo includes a full sandwich, not a half. And personally, I enjoy their soup and salad selection more.  The sandwiches are always good too, but for me, the salads are what make this place so great.  Instead of a cookie with your meal, you get a chocolatedipped strawberry  yum!  I recommend that you try it at least once."
1,"Great Sushi!  Very fresh but a little pricey.  The place has an excellent ambiance...great for celebrations!  Location at the Epicenter is great, especially if you are planning to go out for drinks afterwards."
1,"Ill start by saying the location of the casino is really good, across from the Bellagio and Cosmopolitan. nnHOTELnChecking innWe got two rooms and checked in around ish and was told to come back around  and our rooms would be ready. At our initial clerk, we asked for joint rooms too. Because Two people separately bought the rooms, I didnt want to try the  trick . We did our thing, and came back into the Keys line. The guy said the room wasnt ready yet, but hooked us up with the bigger room. From a Hollywood Hip to a Resort room fountain side. The rooms werent jointed but was one room apart. nnRoom The room itself was pretty big, the bathroom was super huge. Now here are my complaints. One night, a guard interrupted our pregaming and told me that this is a nd complaint and they can kick us out. I told him thats kinda bullshit because we never received our first complaint, so sorry we were loud. Eventually we saw who our neighbors were, some old couple. One of the rooms showers were handicap, so that rooms bathroom floor would be soaked. One of the doors on the cabinets were broken, and we figured whatever, we are not in the hotel that long anyways. nnCASINOnCasino Really confrickingfusing. Everytime I am on the casino floor, I think i know where I am going but it took all  days of my vacation to know where to exactly go. I really do not like how there is no main pathway, its really a cluster of everything in a circle.nnTLDR Got a room upgrade, but got complaints ive never received, and faulty items in the room. Casino is a cluster Fbomb. Has a good location and price, but I think i would spend a bit more and stay else where."
1,"This place is really good. So far Ive had the French Dip and the wings. I didnt like the Hill style wings, but the hot wings were delicious. The French Dip is thin sliced London Broil and it is easily one of the best sandwiches Ive ever had. The prices are reasonable, its out of the hustle and bustle, and the service is good. Cant go wrong with this place."
1,"Went for happy hour and stayed for dinner.... Happy hour specials were okay, but the beer list more than made up for the limited choices of appetizers. The food was excellent, highly recommend the crispy potatoes. The server brought out a sample of fries for us to try free sample that had powdered bacon fat on them... Where has powdered bacon fat been my whole life? nGreat place to grab a drink, amazing beer choices, and if youre in the mood for some really good food. Good location, right in old town scottsdale."
1,"Not top of the line expensive, not cheap and not in the middle. The venetian is in between the top of the line hotels and the medium grade ones...at least thats my interpretation of the venetian...nnI personally love this hotel. The room setup is great, nice and spacious, even for the cheapest rooms! nBut myfavorite part about the rooms here are the showers! There are two jets that are lower back level in addition to the super strong shower head that makes showering orgasmic!"
1,ive been here so many freakin times....nni honestly prefer carnival better.. because i am one of those little bit of everything type and they have much more there...nnbut if you are just wanting crab legs and oysters... this place would be fine! i dont remember the price difference but this one is way less packed than carnival.... so if you want to avoid massive amounts of people on a busy vegas weekend... come here instead... its just on the other side of the casino.nnalso... try the gelato with any of ur favorite toppings... its to die for!nni usually get coffee w heath bar on topnand pistachio with butterfinger.. YUM!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,The staff is always friendly and super quick. I know a lot of times people complain that non starbucks type places take too long but it certainly isnt the case here. The iced caramel is my go to and the matador is delicious but super rich and sweet.
1,"After walking The Strip with my oz of Strawberry Margarita coursing through me, the boyfriend and I decided to grab some dinner.  We headed back to where we were staying at, The Mirage, with CPK in mind.  When we got there, the line was ridiculously huge so we ended up at BLT Burger instead.nnThat was the best decision ever!nnCPK is everywhere.  I get it enough in Arizona.  But a delicious Veggie Falafel burger?  OH GAWD!  I had ordered my vegetarian burger due to feeling the greasy Las Vegas diet slowing me down.  Its seriously the best burger ever  The chickpea gave the burger a delicious crunch while the hummus gave the burger the moisture it needed.  I ordered my burger with Monterey Jack.  It was bliss!  Their spiked milkshakes sounds really intriguing!"
1,"Ive eaten here often with our family, we like it a lot for authentic Mexican.  What they do, they do well.  The guacamole, enchilada verde, beef and chicken tacos, and mole are all dishes I have sampled frequently.  The hibiscus drink they serve is also great, as are the Mexican sodas. Another poster has mentioned it as pricey but they must have been a special event or something because we find the prices reasonable.  Portions are not overly huge this not American style tex mex but more in the vein of enough.  I have never left hungry.nnI will say that because they are mostly just two who work there doing the serving and cooking the service can be a little slow.  And it seems as if it is either empty or packed, and there are not that many tables, so it can be hard to get a place sometimes.nnAlso, we go often with our kids, and the staff are always happy to accommodate by leaving out onions, etc.  Every dish is made to order hence the slowness which allows them to do this easily.  Very friendly.nnGo!  Enjoy!"
1,"Came here on a Saturday night with my girlfriends at pm. We got seated right away our waiter was nice, just slow at times. nnI got the Alaskan Halibut  which was yummy yumyum! The portion was perfect, not too much and not too little. My girlfriends got the Salmon and the pork chop which they loved as well.nnOur table next to us ordered this really huge variety of desserts for . My friends and I were debating to get it, but we decided not to get it. If there were at least  of us, I think it would have been perfect to get. nnAfter coming here, I will most likely come and try some other stuff on the menu."
1,"The service will keep me coming back, the food was mixed.nnMy date and I were running behind and Circo staff kindly honored our reservation even though we were about  minutes late.  We had a great seat by the window which allowed us to catch some of the fountain show over dinner.  The ambiance was definitely bright and festive, and while it wasnt to my particular taste, it was fun and fit in with all the overthetopness that Vegas is.nnThe cocktails were poured stiff which I enjoyed but is definitely a matter of taste.  As we were running a little late and were supposed to catch O later, we were prompt with our orders and our waitress was very accommodating and friendly given our timecrunch.nnWe started with the Beef Carpaccio and both enjoyed it.  It was a nice and light starter though slightly on the salty side.  Next up, was a Sausage and Vegetable Risotto for my date and Panseared Scallops with truffle for myself, both specials of the day.nnMy Panseared Scallops were mostly fantastic one scallop was smaller and turned out a little rubbery and overcooked, and the truffles were absolutely delicious as expected.  The green beans were simple and prepared aldente.nnThe Risotto on the other hand was pretty bad, as the rice was very noticeably undercooked.  In hindsight, given our timecrunch, perhaps Risotto wasnt the best selection we could have made, but there you go.  When the manager came by and asked how everything was, we let him know about the Risotto.  He apologized and asked if we would like a different entree instead, noting that he could have any pasta dish ready in five minutes.  We thanked him but declined as we were in a hurry.nnWhen the bill came he let us know he removed the Risotto from the bill which was entirely unnecessary.  Every interaction we had with the staff of the restaurant host, waitress, manager stood out as exemplary in an era where I find service to generally be poor.  Hence I am giving Circo the benefit of the doubt with fourstars.  I simply docked onestar for a poor dish.  I will be back and update my review at that time."
1,"Ive been going to Rachel Bonn for over  yrs and absolutely LOVE her! Shes an incredibly talented hair stylist both in cut and color! She would have to be considering my ever changing mood from wanting to go blonde, then brunette and back to blonde so often! You know how hard that is to perfect every time but Rachel somehow finds a way to do just that!  I get SO many compliments on my hair and I owe it to her!  I would HIGHLY recommend Rachel to anyone!   nn...AND shes fun and spunky!"
1,"Was my first time getting a brazillian and was using a groupon! She was very professional nice and quick. For a first experience it went fine. It hurt but nothing extreme, mind you I have never gotten anything waxed before professionally. I was in and out and it was over. She uses a combination of wax you can pull wo strips and with strips. Definitely recommend and will personally see her again!"
1,"I generally despise car rental companies and the tricks they try to pull, but I was extremely surprised with how nice Enterprise at PHX is.  Phoenix is an extremely expensive city to rent a car in taxes, fees, whatever the airport decides to milk customers for. I briefly considered taking a cab to my hotel and renting from a neighborhood Enterprise location, but found a great rate on Enterprises website a few weeks before my trip. I reserved a compact car and it was cheaper than any of the other providers, including Fox and Advantage. Reading the reviews of Fox and Advantage there was no way I would rent from them.nnI got a great deal even during the Phoenix Open golf tournament. At noon on a Friday all the rental kiosks had lines, I was dreading this. Enterprise moved quicker than any of the other ones. The check in agent at the counter was very pleasant and didnt upsell anything or try to play any tricks. Quick and painless! They swipe your credit card upstairs and you go down an long escalator to pick up your car.  At the foot of the escalator a very friendly gentleman boomed grab a bottle of water, its free! Youre in the desert, you need to stay hydrated! Very nice touch.nnThe Mike L., rep that helped me select a car was really nice and let me pick out a car in my class that fit my style. I asked if it had an iPod jack so I could plug my iPhone in and listen to music. He literally dug through the dashboards of two separate cars before finding one that did.  That right there is awesome customer service. Mike was knowledgable about local traffic laws No texting, red light cameras in Tempe and Scottsdale, etc and he spent a long time going over the car with me. Brand new car with less than  miles AND an iPod jack? Jackpot!nnDropping off the car was simple. A twosecond look over and I had a receipt in my hand before I had my suitcase out of the trunk. Boom. Done. Easy.  If every car rental experience were like this, there would probably be no wars in the world. I mean that!nnLets recapn Quick moving linen Free water, because youre in the desert, afterall!n Mike L. is the most knowledgable and patient rental agent evern Brand new car with the features I wantedn all of the above at cost LESS than any of the other other rental companies during a major event at PHX"
1,star Chicago style hot dog!! Ive been to Chicago and this hot dog is almost exactly the same.  Its a small mom and pop place with straight to the point service.  Always order the dog with everything on it otherwise youre just not getting the full pleasure of a Chicago style hot dog.
1,"If you want cheap gaming this is the spot,  blackjack, video poker, big hot dogs, lots of slots, I love the big one outside someone always win a few bucks, but skip the margaritas they really dont put much liquor in them. Its older and a little far down the strip, but you can beat the cheap gaming, also I love the fact the the machines pay coins win you hit nothing beats the sound of all those coins dropping cha ching! cha ching! cha ching!"
1,"Its been several months since Ive been here, so I dont know if anything has changed, but heres what I thought about itnLove the decor big chandelier by the dancefloor, bathrooms, light squares on the wall, everything was cool looking.nLove the music hip hop  top . I hate house music so Im glad Vanity rarely plays house music.nEvery  min or so, they blast a shot of cold air onto the dance floor great when its crowded  youre dancing up a sweat.nTheres actually places for you to sit  rest your feet you dont need a table reservation just to sit."
1,"Like many people who work or live in the western part of Mesa near the  I have driven by this place  times a day for the past  years.  I dont want to add up how many times that is but  might be reasonable. I have to admit that the location is a bit weird, its a strange little mall tucked away from the street.  The sign has letters I dont understand.  nnI went there because one of my techs was called to work on one of their refrigerated cases and told me how nice it was.   I went in there and did not tell them anything about my guys working there.  They were so incredibly nice and helpful I could not believe it.  When I told them that is was my first time there they patiently explained everything on the menu to me and even brought me samples of some items I had not had before.  nnThe shwarma is my favorite for the meats both chicken and beef but everything I have tried is fresh and flavorful.  Their kabobs use good quality meat that isnt too chewy.  I am a total hummus snob and make my own frequently.  Theirs is made fresh every day and tastes as good as my home made if not better.  In fact my wife bought some at Costco today and it was so bad in comparison that it made me remember I had to give these people a good review.   You can buy the same ingredients in the attached store and if you ask they will tell you which ones are best.   The have great pita bread in the freezer you can warm up and is better than any other pita bread around here.  Their prices in both the restaurant and deli are very reasonable for the quality of the food.nnAnother reviewer mentioned wiping the tables with the same rag as they wiped the tables.  I have seen multiple restaurants do this and as long as the rag has proper disinfectant I do not see anything wrong with it. In fact  think about it  you almost always put your hands down on a booth when  you slide in, then you eat with them!  I am GLAD they wipe down the booths with disinfectant.    I like this place because it is clean, you can see back into the kitchen and see how they keep it.  I dont think giving such a low rating for what seems to be a standard practice is very fair. nnYes, the different tiles in the dining room a a bit weird, but it is only like  difference.  The location is a little different as is the layout.  In the first of this review I mentioned I had driven buy it literally thousands of times over the last  years. It seemed a little odd and I missed out all that time by not exploring it.  If you dont like exploring a little different cultures go to McDonalds.  These are hard working people who make the best food they know how, make it fresh and are incredibly nice.  They have some very beautiful women working there who are also very nice and helpful.  The whole place is maybe a little different than we are used to in Mesa but if you want interesting and flavorful experience stop there and give them a try."
1,"Another   Star golf course in my book.....if you get a chance to play Dragon Ridge, make sure you take your time and enjoy everything this course has to offer.nnThe course is tucked atop the most exclusive area of McDonalds Ranch in Henderson.  The golf course is very challenging and the elevations and valleys will fool your eyes into believing the distances are not what they appear to be.  Despite its tough layout, its a very fun course.  The views of the Las Vegas Valley are amazing!nnThe greens are very fast on this course, so bring your AGame and make sure you hit the practice green before you step up to the st Tee!  If you play this course during the Summer, make sure you buy some water to bring with you during the round, because it gets really hot!  Im accustomed to playing in the desert and normally dont have any issues with playing in  degree heat, but this course for some reason must have a magnifying glass hovering above it.....it was a scorcher!nnThe food in the clubhouse is very good.....what you would expect for an exclusive private golf club.nnWill I return?  The next opportunity I get!"
1,"Second stop on our continuing Aria foodie crawl, part two.  This is the best restaurant of the whole bunch I dare say. nnSage has an excellent selection of beer on tap and our bartender, Brad, let us try a few before settling on a drink.  They have the Dogfish Midas Touch on tap , which is super yummy.  And they serve it in an actual Dogfish beer glass.  Classy!  My husband got a beer cocktail, which is called the European Union .  Youngs Chocolate Stout, Lindermans Framboise Lambic, and Cardenal Mendoza Solera Gran Reserva brandy.  I thought this would be awful, but I tried some and it tastes terrific!nnThey have Sierra Nevada th Anniversary Ale on tap, which is a rare find indeed!  We did not try it because we have a bottle at home but after we try the bottle, we may need to come back and compare it on tap.  Check out my pic of the menu to see what else they have on tap.nnFor food, we tried the salumi which comes with pickled green beans .  Very yummy.  We also had the poached egg  which comes with bacon yum! and bread to dip.  Very good.  Finally we had the beef tartare  which is topped with an egg perfectly cooked over medium and crispy chocolate flakes.  Sooo good, I could not stay away.  Portion sizes are reasonable.  Not too tiny, but not overwhelmingly big either.nnApparently you can only get the bar menu at the bar  and they have some really special items there so I suggest you check it out.  The bar only has seating at the bar.  There are two round tables in front of the bar but those are only for people waiting for a table.nnAlso, they serve beer in  oz growlers but our bartender did not recommend it.  First, it results in a messy pour and, second, the beer gets warm too fast.  Apparently, when the restaurant first opened they thought it would be a good idea to sell beer to go in the growlers.  But Aria put a kabash on that.  According to our bartender, its all good to have people running around with big ass margaritas in glasses or plastic yards but not beer in growlers.nnThey serve the full menu at the bar as well, and we debated trying the famed foie gras creme brulee but we were getting full and had a few more restaurants to try that night.  Next time!nnI highly recommend checking out the bar next time you are in Aria.  Its not very expensive as compared to the nearby Todd English PUB but is much nicer with much more interesting beer and food selections."
1,"Let me begin by saying that I dont want to sound pretentious but like everyone elses reviews Im reading I find it REAL hard to give such a standout score to a chain.   Yet everytime I walk into this place which is conveniently located a couple of blocks from my house I feel like quoting Randall from Clerks.  You know the scene where he asks Dante if he can borrow his car keys so he can go to the video store and Dante says you work in a video storeand he replies yeah but I work in a shitty video store and then they show him walking into the other video store with angelic music as if he is ascending into heaven ... thats the feeling I get when I walk into this place.  A major plus is it doesnt FEEL like a chain ... the aforementioned staff recommendations scattered throughout the store give it a cozy feel and make you forget its a chain.  Unlike other reviewers I disagree in that the staff is helpful and attentive ...To me however this is a plus as Im allowed to peruse at my own pace and search on my own...yet the only time I asked for assistance the  pack of guiness rack was empty they promptly filled my request.  Im more of a beer and irish whiskey guy as a rule and their choices here are varied and appropriately priced.  One of the only places Ive found where you can grab a bottle of powers and I also find the locally brewed cave creek chile beer to be a surprising treat think a nonshitty corona with a chile floating in the bottom instead of a lime floating on top.  This place has soooo much wine to choose from Ive been experimenting again lately ... current faves are zen of zin zinfandel and renwood syrah  If you like booze, cigars and cheap prices this place cant be beat even if it is a chain."
1,"I am not a fan of thin crust pizza, but I think Settebello has made me a convert!  I met some friends for lunch there this weekend, and had a really great meal.  They are experienced Settebello diners, and we ordered  pizzas to share among us.  nnWe arrived just after they opened, and were seated right away. The restaurant itself is lovely and airy. Service was friendly and conversational.  We ordered the settebello, the bianca, and another pizza that was not listed on the menu I believe it is called the Raphael.  All of them were delicious. The dough tasted fresh, the ingredients were delicious, and I didnt even mind that the crust was thin it wasnt too hard and crunchy.nnI am glad that Settebello is on the west side of the valley, and Im sure I will return!"
1,"I must emphasize that this is first and foremost a BAR. There are tables as well as the bar area to sit at, but it is a BAR. DO NOT go here thinking it will be sit down Italian restaurant like Aiellos etc. nnThe food was very good. The chicken fettuccine was tasty with the grilled chicken. The rolls? Meh. But then when did you go to a restaurant for the rolls? Unless you are a freak that goes to Olive Garden and eats their swill just to get those damn processed breadsticks.nnAGAIN, THIS IS A BAR. Dont post a review slamming the decor when you didnt do your research first."
1,"I loved this place when i was last there...a few months ago. Great burgers. I have since gone vegetarian and was looking forward to trying their veggie burger last night but when I got there at pm, they were out of veggie burgers  ? I was pretty bummed. The manager gave me a  discount on my next visit. So, I guess they handled it, sort of. Nice people, but I was still bummed."
1,"First time trying this place.  I wanted to rate it a ., just because I want to explore other menu items before raising the rating, but eff it, it was delicious.nnI opted out of going to a ballgame with my man for the night, so I decided to stay home, order pizza, do homework, and watch movies. I wanted to try out someplace new by my house, so I explored the Yelp community and their reviews, and stumbled across this place.nnI called in my order.  The man who answered was friendly when taking my order.  I had bad reception in my apartment, but he seemed patient throughout the ordering process.  I decided to go with the special, XL or L pizza with  wings for around  bucks.  Not bad, ey?  I got my regular toppings, ham on all, half pep, half pinapple.  Mild wings.  nnApproximately  minutes later the food arrived at the door.  A faint little knock almost unheard to an old person presented itself for me to answer.  HOLY CRAP, I thought when I saw the food.  The pizza box was SO damn big!  When I brought the food inside, I was still irked.  The slices were huge.  The pizza was hot and fresh.  Melted cheese.  Not a lot of grease.  I asked for extra sauce, and I got it.nnThis is the kind of pizza that is meant to be folded in half.  Do not try and eat it otherwise, it just wont work. The wings were flavorful and large as well.  These are not sissy sized wings.nnOverall, high quality pizza and wings.  I really want to try this place fresh from the restaurant.  I think it may earn an additional star.  Nothing is better than fresh of the plate, but delivery was acceptable for my current situation which apparently is free!."
1,"So while sorting out a newly purchase used car, it became evident that the deck and speakers were in need of replacement. Quality Car Audio had great reviews and they didnt not disappoint. Chase, the owner, was really helpful. The tech who installed the said items was great as well. They have earned my repeat business in the future. To me they are one of the top audio shops in the valley."
1,"Wow, good stuff!  Staff is super friendly and chef is very accomodating.  My cousin ordered the fried chicken breast as boneless and they didnt hesitate to fulfill her request.  Wow, talk about top notch southern fried chicken!  The chef came out to make sure she was pleased, too!  The cornbread pancakes were yummy as a starter.  I had the fried cat fish with sides of collard greens and mac  cheese.  There are full and half orders.  Half orders are already big in portion, so you are warned LOL  My party of  shared a sweet potato pie ... OMG to die for!!!  Highly recommended.  Enjoy the celebrity photosguests on the wall who enjoyed the restaurant, too."
1,"Cant beat this place! Excellent service, excellent food, excellent company!nnIve been a regular although not as often as Id like lately for over  years, and its always awesome.  From Brenda, to Heather, to Erin and of course Kendra, all of the staff at CKs is amazing! nnGreat place to hold a fantasy draft or just drop in for wings raspberry chipotle grilled with a side of hot! and a beer.  Youre always treated as a VIP at CKs!"
1,"Yummy!!! Oishi!!! nnLove this place. Its not pretentious and the food is good. I wish the restaurant was bigger so I dont have to wait in line so long! As well, a bit bigger so I dont feel like a freaking elephant when I try to squeeze by to get a seat.nnI like their shrimp burger and their salmon tartar bowl and their salmon salad for that matter was extremely tasty.nnDont go there with children. Not enough room!"
1,"Best day to come to watch movies. Cheap movie night. . what a deal at what movies cost regular days. ncheap popcorn too, if you have a regal card you can get a small popcorn for . and you can earn rewards with that card on every purchase.nI think they also have . hot dog or Nachos for the same price.nNow days y I u have to find deals that offer you more for your money especially ent"
1,"We have been here twice now. nnWhat I like  service is excellent. Ask to be in Jays section! nThe overall vibe, music, ping pong, cornhole, TV screens, seating areas  beer selection. An excellent place to hang with friends!nThings that could improve  very spendy for the qualify of food, if you sit in the outdoor area this time of the year prepare for your food to arrive a little cold, if going for a football game they have great TV screens the visibility on the outdoor screens is a little off in each of the areas."
1,"Great decor for the themespiderwebs, some shorts in beakers, random scientific looking stuffand also great music for the themeits back from the dead s music. Not sure if they always play music by the decade, but they should. You would need to be in a certain mood to go there there thoughnot your average night outand, because of the decor, I felt like I should have dressed up more."
1,"Divertido is one of those little boutique shops that is always full of the weird and interesting. Ive purchased a few things from here and like to go in every few months just to see what new stuff is in stock.nnThe owner is very friendly. My fondest memory of Lawrenceville is when my girlfriend and I walked around the neighborhood right before moving in. We got to talking to the owner of Divertido for about half an hour and when we left the store, we pretty much knew we made a good choice moving into the neighborhood.nnNow, with the likes of Wildcard moving in, Lawrenceville is starting to become a less upscale version of Walnut Street in Shadyside. Something I dont mind at all."
1,"Great service, friendly staff. Hash browns were tasty and kids loved the waffles. nnDiner styled atmosphere. Safe area. nnWaitress gave us a free waffle which was nice. Coffee was good. nnVery satisfied for what it is."
1,"Outstanding food. Make sure to wear stretchy pants because you will walk out of this restaurant  pounds heavier. One of the best BBQ places Ive ever tried. I highly suggest making a reservation because it can get busy in there. Ive gone with friends and we share the Whole Hog Heaven which gives you the opportunity to try  different meats on their menu plus  sides. But the best part is defitnitely their bbq sauce so make sure to ask for extra because they will gladly give it to you! Their roasted corn is my favorite side dish and the mac and cheese is really good too. nnAlso, try the Qrolls as a starter. The chipotle dip is delicious! And make sure to get an order of the cornbread too..you wont regret it!"
1,If you are looking to get off the strip and chill at a trendy spot this is a must try.  The barlounge area gives you a lot of versatility for people watching and mingling.nnThe happy hour offers  off on all appetizers.  Score!
1,"After lunch with my family, we wanted to get something sweet. We were gonna go to Slickables like we always do for some ice cream, but I remembered driving by this palace and always wanted to stop by. I checked in on Yelp, like I always do when I go somewhere and they had a deal,  for  worth of goodies, so I thought why not thats a SUPER deal. My cousin and I split the voucher so we each paid  for  worth of goodies. I got some sugar free chocolates, which also happened to be  off, coconut caramel candy apple, which was  off, a bottle of water, a bag of honey roasted peanuts, a cup of gelato, and  packs of pop rocks. The candy apple was DELISH! They also had home made fudge, different varieties and the good thing was that we were able to sample all of them! I recommend the Rasberry Swirl, that was pretty good. If your looking for some good gelato, try the mango! I also like the fact that they had unique drinks and chocolate. They had bacon soda to beef jerky chocolate, I dont know if I would ever try them, but I know someone out there would!"
1,"My first nonfoodrelated review. nnFive stars! What can I say, I brought my bike in to the service department. The guys were cool with me, I dont know much about bikes, and they treated me with respect. Scot Hefington was the guy that helped me and he was very knolegeable and really cool about my ignorance with bikes. He took care of things fast, but not rushed. Way above my expectations. nAfter I left service, I walked around the showroom and the sales guys were cool too. Not pushy, no bullshit. It was the first time Ive been to a dealership and didnt feel like hiding from the sales people.  nAfter the showroom came the softgoods. Huge selection!  The girls over here were friendly, hot and helpful. nnEverything about this dealership screamed  stars!! Too bad I can only give ."
1,"Looking for that unique and entertaining idea for your next event? Everyone has that one party that keeps coming up for years to come as the one everyone remembers. Brett brought the party tonight for our event. He is engaging and kept the crowd in awe. He enchanted us with his simplistic but unexplainable performance. Dont trust the Rubiks cube it will give you away! nI would recommend Brett highly for any party, large or small, and all ages. He is quite gifted and will leave you pondering..."
1,"Great experience so far! They really bring in a new look to downtown. My friends and I usually go for The Griffin by default, but Im so glad Commonwealth opened so we can migrate from The Griffin! nnThe decor is fun and open and the ceiling high. The upstairs is really lovely, I feel like Im in a different city to be honest. The atmosphere is fun and you can see all kinds of people about! nnDefiantly a favorite bar in Vegas so far!"
1,"We knew Maggie and Toshi since they were still in running a restaurant in CA. We knew them for great food and great service. And when we got a chance to visit AZ, we made a special trip to visit their restaurant, and they are still pretty much the same. Serving good food! We enjoyed their sushi creations as well as their other dishes Toshis japanese curry is my husbands fav dishes. They have more sushi than before, and it seems  week is hardly enough time to try everything on the menu. I wish I can pack some and bring it to CA. nAnyway, we recommend this restaurant for people that simply want to get a good Japanese food!"
1,"I always love coming to the Chandelier for drinks. The ambiance is exactly what Im looking for when Im visiting Las Vegas. Since its within the Cosmo, youll still get the upscale chic vibe that youd expect in a boutique resort. Its usually easy to find space to occupy since this lounge spans  stories."
1,"This is the BEST cirque show Ive seen, well actually my FIRST and I LOVED IT!  With the greeters and ushers dressed in costume when you walk into the theatre you get excited to see whats going to happen.  Loved the storyline, acrobats, costumes, stunts and that massive stage.  I seriously cant get over that rotating stage.  My fave scene is the simulated sea scene it really looked real.  Even the battle scenes when they moved in slow motion was kind of cool too.  You must see this show if you havent yet.  We had awesome seats really comfy and i dont think theres a bad seat in the house.  Now im hooked I MUST see the other Cirque du Soleil shows and I WILL!!nThe only annoying thing is the ding dongs who come in late and block your view."
1,David over there at My Computer Bytes has the best costumer service and level of professionalism that I have ever experience.  His knowledge is unsurpassed and has been able to easily solve and fix many computer issues of mine.  This is the guy that helped laptop xchange get off their feet.  Now he has his own shop and its x better!  I suggest if your computer bites sucks take it to David for a tune up!
1,"OMG! I finally checked this place out a few months back and cant stop talking about it! Its like a freakin Goya warehouse!  Asian, Indian, Jamaican food..The only place I can find pre made Jamaican beef patties. There are tons and tons of  refrigerators filled with an unlimited supply of various potstickers. It doesnt get any better than that! Also all sorts of fun cookies and wafers from the orient. This place is freakin awesome AND its not expensive in the least bit to boot!"
1,". Stars nI stay at Ballys for a week and got to say it was good. If you looking for a hotel on the strip that near everything and dont want to pay a arm or a leg for it then stay at Ballys. Services was excellent and everything was close by. When I got there I ask if I could get a two queen bed instead of one and they upgrade me to the North tower deluxe room it was spacious, nice, and clean, and updated. No extra charge. The only draw by at that time was there was no refrigerator or microwave, but hey it Vegas I was going to eat out most of the time anyways and my friend gave me her cooler to keep all the drinks cold. Anyways if you need a refrigerator it  a night if you wanted to know. I pay about  something a night, Sunday to Saturday. I had a promotion code I got off the Internet. Also on the second day the house keeping staff notice a little wet spot on the carpet and got this air blower in the room when I came back they left me a message to call the front desk. When I called they ask if I was ok if they upgrade me to the honeymoon suite with a jacuzzi  and the view of the strip and the dance fountain show. It was nice got to say Ballys is a good hotel if you looking for a nice clean place to sleep on the strip and the price is just right. It also connected to Paris and in walking distance to everything. There pool isnt the greatest pool thought, but I went to other pools but for the price and everything I think it great. Oh yeah the Wi fi isnt free you have to pay for it so that might be a draw back for some."
1,"This place is great for a craft beer to stay or to go!  nnThey have  good craft beers on tap obvi. nnIts in the heart of the NY NY hotel, overlooking the casino area which is fun while youre sitting enjoying your beer!  nnWorth a stop for sure!"
1,"Came here for a birthday dinner because of the belly dancing entertainment they had.nnThe restaurant was empty upon arrival, but we were seated very quickly by the owner.nnThe owner and his wife are very friendly. He was very informative in explaining all the menu items and specials, and even recommended a Lebanese beer to try.nnThe appetizers came out quickly. We ordered the hummus to start which was made very well and had an addicting flavor. Their pita bread tasted a bit more authentic than most places and complimented the hummus.nnThe lentil soup that came with the meal was excellent, I wish it was larger because I could have eaten a huge bowl of it.nnSoon after the appetizers the belly dancer started, she was very friendly and was very good at the same time. Even brought up the birthday girl to the front and danced with her.nnOur food came out in adequate time. I ordered the combination kabob plate. All the meat was very tender and extremely juicy. The rice pilaf had amazing flavor and everyone at the table loved it.nnAt the end of the meal I ordered a cup of coffee which was pretty much the icing on the cake for me, and instantly made me a fan of this place.nnFor a place that has been here  years I am surprised I have never steeped foot in here before. I can guarantee I will step foot in this place again very soon."
1,"Best mac and cheese around, interesting and delicious drinks, and awesome wait staff. This is another dogfriendly gem. They have water bowls for your dogs and a huge patio thats beautiful in AZs nicer months. The building is really architecturally interesting  it has a huge window that makes you feel like youre in the biodome. If you come here enough, you can definitely feel at home in this place and the wait staff will quickly become your friends."
1,"This place never gets old! Ahhhh so drunk, where can we go sober up and eat Pho at the same time!  Ill tell you where, Pho Kim Long!  Its like the hangout for people that just went clubbing.  Girls stumble in drunk in short skirts and guys chatting about girls drunk in short skirts.nnService is very good. The Pho in my opinion are pretty good as well.  Sorry I cant really put much info on the menu bcause Ive always ordered by numbers in a Pho Restaurant. But all the Pho are pretty Phoking good. Best remedy to prevent a hangover."
1,"I personally love Pei Wei. It may not be authentic but it is delicious!nnThis location always has helpful staff and consistently wellmade dishes. It can be hard to find a table during peak times, but the staff is good about clearing tables quickly. nnI find that Pei Wei offers ample portions more so when dining in and quick takeout. You can call ahead or order online. nnI highly recommend honey seared chicken on white rice with extra sauce no charge. The spring rolls are also a favoritelove that chili sauce!  The only downside to the spring rolls is that they dont do too well after being refrigerated. Eat them while theyre still warm!nnMy parents and brothers are all vegetarians so we always get tofu when eating as a family.  Lately, the tofu at this location has been subpar.  They dont seem to cook it quite long enough, and that has definitely cut back on the frequency of our visits.  Hopefully this changes, because the tofu here is usually amazing!"
1,"Earl of Sandwich is probably one of the spots I go to eat whenever I am in Vegas.  Its open  hours, which is great for after clubbing eats or even a quick meal before clubbing andor a night of bar hopping.  I have been here a number of times and always try something different.  So far everything has been really good with the exception of one sandwich that i think was given to me in error.  Overall, I think this place is a gem of a place because its cheap, tasty, quick, lots of different hot sandwiches, salads, and wraps to choose from, and is open  hours a day."
1,"I never knew of a Thelmas in Waipahu, but apparently its popular enough to open up a store here in the th island. nnI went  days ago to try it out and I am so glad I did!nnWent there for the lunch special. . for your choice of entree, that comes with rice, mac salad, a drink, and fruit salad for dessert! WOW. I was already impressed when I saw that near the register. I opted for the PInakbet, and my boyfriend got the Thelmas Special. They had ran out of mac salad that day, but the friendly lady at the register offered to give us some mixed pancit in place of it. I was cool with that! So we pay and take our seats, and dabble in the ridiculous game shows that seem to be endlessly playing on Filipino channels... well that and then a drama shortly after! nnWe get our lunch plates, and they are decently sized! For . including a drink, I honestly think its a steal! nnI had a taste of my boyfriends Thelmas special and had to restrain my fork from ravaging his plate again! IT IS SO GOOD. I dont know about you guys, but thats the closest Lechon Kawali that I can get here in Vegas, and ALMOST identical to the dish I remember at my family parties in Hawaii! YUMnnMy pinakbet was... average, to say the least. The tastes were okay, I was expecting a very soupy dish, with A LOT of soft vegetables, but it was just okay. The eggplant in it had too toughthick of a skin, and I just think it needed to be cooked a bit longer.nnIts okay, we both finished our plates, down to the last rice grain!nThen, our waitress came out with our fruit salad! Yay! Although it was a bit sweet for my taste buds, I am glad that it comes with some sort of dessert!nnAll in all, I would come back to this place to sample their other popular items! Service was great, and the restaurant was clean and inviting. Recommended for a fast, affordable meal."
1,"To be nobody but yourself in a world which is doing its best, night and day, to make you everybody else means to fight the hardest battle which any human being can fight and never stop fighting.  e.e. cummings, nnBikini is a true dive bar.

Bikini tries to live up to no ones standards and despite the array of negative things one can say about the place, it is part of its charm and its charm will win you over. nnMy friend ordered a tequila the other night. nnDo you want the Well or Jose Cuervo? nnI was shocked so I made the inquiry. Pardon me out of curiosity what is your well tequila? What can you possibly have worse than Jose Cuervo?nnTwo Fingers.

1,"Had my daughter check Yelp before she took in her truck to get brakes done. It was narrowed down to Professional Brake Service based on the reviews it received.  After picking up her truck today, I can verify and say all the previous reviews were spot on. Honest people, they know what theyre doing, they dont cut corners and everything is explained in detail and easy to understand.nnJeff the owner kept in contact and called with the diagnosis within the hour, explained everything to Miss B. and to her dad on what needed to be done. I wont go into detail but know Miss B.s truck needed major brake work done. see pic  httpimageshack.usaimgpicsay.jpgnnRepair was done and got the truck back the next day as promised. When we came in Jeff and staff took time out to show us all parts that they replaced.  It clearly wasnt your everyday two hundred dollar special brake job. Her truck had some serious brake damage and they did a great job replacing everything. Truck was now good to go and Miss B. said her truck has never been so quiet.nnIve had nightmare issues with chain brake shops in the past that didnt care after you left their shop. I got a sense Jeff was concerned for our familys safety.  He kept emphasizing and told Miss B. to come in or call if she has problems and to come in and have her brakes checked in a year. Even gave her some driving tips!  I have complete confidence in this shop and will most definitely look them up again."
1,"Every time I end up going to Casa Don Juan, which is pretty much every First Friday because theyre right down the street from where Im hanging, there is an encounter with a crazy person or two.  Sometimes the crazy people are in my group yakking on and on about riding sheep, sometimes theyre in the form of a large, older woman showing us the tattoo on her breast.  And in case you were wondering, yes it involved a rose.  Because of this and this alone, this very mediocre place gets an extra star.  I loves me some crazies!nnThe food is OK.  Its not scary or anything, and when youve got a Friday night, beer fueled hunger on it can be damn fine.  Its better than Macayos even though the waitresses share uniforms, I think.  The service is pretty universally crappy.  Maybe its because Im there on what has to be their busiest night of the month, but seriously, one should not have to wait  minutes for a check.  nnI would like to kiss the man who brought a fellow diner a side of sour cream on a plate.  A few minutes later, he reached for what he thought was his napkin and got a surprise.  It gave me a different crazy to look at to distract me from that ladys boob."
1,"Went again tonight. This place is great. Great service, not overbearing, not aloof, good drinks, not crazy, no mixologist jerkoffs just really honest drinks. Sake, sochu is great as well. Selection of ramen is really good Paitan was really great, Tan Tan Man is pretty awesome. Again people on here giving anything less than four stars, I have to call you out. Ive had the best in the US, from Momofuku, to Oiister, to Tatsuya, to Yamadaya, to Slurping turtle and this shop good. Owner is always there and is super cool and knows what he is about, what he can do, and he serves people. Talk to him about food and ask him about his ramen. Enjoy the experience and honestly just get plastered, bring a big group of friends, enjoy the noodle and try and have a good time."

It does get kinda crowded and chaotic on weekend nights. The grocery store in pretty cool but didnt buy anything. Like a previous review, it did feel like a upscale Cracker Barrel. All around a great place to eat. Also, Take a camera so you can take pictures of all the lame hipster clowns that try to make it all about them. They are the only downside to LGO."

1,Cheuvronts is a nice little spot in Downtown Phoenix and a perfect place for a date night. The wine and cheese was fantastic. I was also very impressed by the attentiveness of the wait staff. Ill definitely be going back!
1,"Never having been to Wisconsin, I was pleasantly surprised to find this clean, spacious and well organized store. Virtually a onestop shop for all your grocery needs with a number of bonus points including a photo lab, US Postal Service, wine  spirits, bulk foods, Caribou Coffee counter, hot food  deli, plus a drivethru pharmacy. They even had some Badger gear. If I wasnt in such a hurry to catch a plane i could have spent the whole afternoon there."
1,"I was referred to Roland by my good friend Dean. Im glad he did so. What I thought was going to cost me a fortune was only a fraction of my estimate. I had GFIs tripping all over the house at an alarming rate. So much so, I thought I was going to need some serious electrical work done, and when I say serious I really mean . He discovered the problem quickly and was in and out just as fast and was very professional. A less reputable person could of milked me for a lot of time and work that simply was not needed. Even though I did not find Roland on Yelp I felt compelled to share my experience."
1,"I found her on Groupon and I was pleasantly surprised considering the low price. Shes kind, doesnt make the wax awkward whatsoever and does a great job with the actual wax. I would absolutely recommend her."
1,"Tom Colicchios Heritage Steak is a wonderful new addition to the Mirage hotel.  Located where Kokomos used to be near the front of the hotel, the dining room seems to be tucked away from the slot machines and tourists meandering about out front.  Inside is a nicely designed  seating area, where steaks are flame broiled in plain view.  The appetizer list makes for a tough decision, with so many great choices to choose from.  The Hamachi with beet and caviar is a wonderful combination of sea and greens, refreshing and flavorful.  The grilled peaches with jamon iberico and pepper arugula salad is a MUST!  Best grilled peaches I have ever tasted.  The octopus was a bit lackluster.  Could not really find the main focus of the dish.  A bit mush and the flavors did not blend well.  The steaks are great.  Prime cuts, beautiful look, and extremely flavorful.  The desert menu makes for a hard choice, but I tried the corn fritters which I think were more like corn beignets or doughnuts with blueberries and corn ice cream.  Wish I could have gotten a pint of the corn ice cream to take home.  Overall, this place is great!  The only reason I am not giving  stars is because the staff will bring your plate and drop it off and then leave.  No explanation of the food so keep a menu nearby during the meal!.  Other than that, this a must goto for any foodie and should become a regular spot for any local fan of good food!"
1,"So the Soba is the specialty here along with a lot of little plates.  There is NO alchohol here, at least when I visited about a month ago.  The food is well prepared, and really enjoyed the wasabi relish, was so tasty, reminded me of my little sushi place back home.  It is a small place but I am definitely coming back as everything was made to order with love.  If you are a serious FRESH fish person, then dont know if you will get the selection you are looking for, but still very tasty for what they have and the method by which they prepare."
1,We have been here many times in the past and have been very satisfied every time we have dined. Emphasis is more on the food than service. I have not ordered anything that I was not satisfied with. The other day we went for Sunday lunch and was kind of surprised that it was not that busy. Overall I think this is one of the best places to eat in the Southpark area.
1,"Weve been here a few times but have never had the ribs until this visit. WOW ! Unbelievably awesome. Ive had a lot of ribs from other places and these were some of the best Ive had. Really enjoyed the smokehouse habanero sauce. nnWell done, Hammered Hog !"
1,"This place is so fresh and so green green!!!  n  I loved my chicken wrap, to bad their so close to my official work place or else I would eat this over Jimmy Johns and Subway any day!! This time I was luckily around the area getting training done at another work location nearby this little bad boy!! n How lucky was I, I had heard of this place from an old classmate from Tempe, he used to work here and also had invited me over to try some of their goodness, plus the prices are affordable and understandable to their selections!! nI truly loved the flavors in my wrap, so full and bold, I was satisfied and still feeling healthy in the end!! nWay to go ZK Bistro!!!!!! You rock!!!  I look forward to coming here more often!!"
1,"Renting a car from Hertz in Las Vegas is a snap.   Since I am a Gold Member, I make my reservation on their website and the car is waiting for me when I arrive.   No fussing about.   In, out and off to some new adventure.  nOn the rare occasion when they are having difficulties, they have done their best to make things right.   The crew there is pretty good.   Returning the car is a snap as well.    The return lanes are clearly marked and the check in process is pretty quick.   It takes about as long to get your stuff out of the car as it does for the crew to print out your receipt.   nWill I be back?   Of course, places are too far to walk in Las Vegas!"
1,"My wife and I had dinner on Wednesday  and all I can say is WOW WOW WOW!nnI had the bone In New York Strip and it sets the standard for all New York Strips that Ive ever had.  The secret is the aging of the beef and the type of salt they use to age it with.  It was so tender, I could have cut it with a butter knife.nThe breads that are standard before the main course were incredible, four different types and all very tasty.  The Market Green Salad was excellent and the dessert, Blueberry Tarts, was terrific.nEating at this establishment is highly recommended.  The one thing I will let you know, this isnt an inexpensive place to eat.  Our total, with one alcoholic drink and one non alcoholic drink, set us back  before tip.  It is well worth it for the quality and quantity of food you get. nThe best for last here.......this establishment knows how to make the customer feel welcomed.  The complete staff was the best Ive encountered in very long time.  Tip them at least .....they deserve it."
1,"I had lived in the Phoenix area since , and always loved the food and service at Bobby Qs.  I recently sold my home in Glendale, retired from teaching and married the love of my life, living in Cabo for  months in the winter, and traveling the world the other .  My husband loves ribs, so where ever we land, we try that areas ribs. I have always bragged about Bobbys ribs, so since were here for a hip replacement  and PT, I suggested going there this Sunday evening, I was a bit nervous, but I was right in my judgement. My husband thought they were  the BEST ribs he had EVER tasted! The ambience is romantic, and beautiful, the service perfect, moist cornbread, and the most delicious meltinyourmouth babyback ribs and St Louis ribs, that we have ever tasted. Thanks for not disappointing me, Bobby!  You just keep up your tradition of fantastic restaurants! Oh yes, and you dont leave without being given free donuts hot out of the oven. My husband has a sweet tooth, so he loved your place even more. Delicious!!!"
1,"I have been here in years past, and this place has gotten better.  Pulled pork was good, brisket and pork drummets were very good.  ok mac and cheese, I would get something else next time. The chocolate covered donuts were really good.  Ribs were overcooked, people say fall off the bone ribs this usually means overcooked and it was definitely the case here.  The sauce was good enough to cover up the dryness, but there are good things on the menu besides the ribs."
1,"My husband and I dined here for lunch on a recent trip to Vegas and we were very impressed! We just sat in the bar area, but the ambience seemed very nice, the decor was eye catching, and the service was excellent. We both ordered the bento box lunch, my husband got his with the sushi and I ordered the miso cod with mine. My husband was extremely jealous of the AWESOME miso cod that I was able to devour! I order miso cod quite often when its on a menu, and this is one of the best Ive ever had. It was a good sized serving, especially considering all of the other items in the bento lunch, all for only ! I found it to be a great deal for what it was. We were already inebriated from the gigantic drinks at Fat Tuesday, so we didnt get to sample the libations at Social House, but we WILL be back next time were in town!"
1,"These guys are great, even work on Saturday!  I have used them a few times and the do come all the way out to the NW valley.  I was referred to them and have been pleased.  They always call when they are on their way just like they said they would and their prices are fair.  What else is there?  Ive had them rebuild a few of my toilets and now are bidding a gas line for my stove since it is currently electric and we want a gas stove top.  Price was very fair."
1,"I want a new car and Audi Henderson have the car Im looking for. I show up at . on a Tuesday morning. I am immediately greeted by a friendly salesman named Nial. He offers me a test drive and indeed quite a lengthy drive. He is very knowledgable and clearly loves the Audi product. nnAfter the test drive we sit in the extremely luxurious showroom and negotiations begin. I meet a manager named Matt, who despite being an Arsenal fan, is actually an extremely nice guy and we agree a deal in just a few minutes. nnI am not financing so I hope I can just pay and leave, this is where things slow down. I have to wait while documents are printed which seems to take forever. Eventually they are ready and I then go to Finance manager, again another great guy who is super friendly and professional. His paperwork is immaculate, accurate and after about  signatures I am allowed to go to the bank and fetch the check. nnWhen I get back, the car is cleaned, gassed and beautiful. I am very happy, the dealership was outstanding and I am loving the car. I eventually leave at ., I just wish it could be a speedier transaction."
1,"Take notice Vegas, this is how a hotel is supposed to be. I have only been absent from this place for  days now but I am so ready to head back. I stayed here for  nights and  days and enjoyed every minute of it. We arrived here on at Thursday afternoon and were originally dismayed when they said our rooms were not ready and that we would have to wait. This isnt exactly the thing you want to hear after traveling  miles but the situation was quickly corrected after our check in lady talked to management. Not only did they get us room upgrades but they were able to get me and my friend rooms on the same floor. Score!! Ronnie our check in lady was also gave us the lowdown on the hotel and told us the best places to eat and shop. First and foremost everything in this place is absolutely stunning of course its new but its much more than just that. No expense was spared in design or materials. Jesus, they even hired a world famous graffiti artist to spray paint the walls in the parking garage. nnThe room was tastefully decorated, comfortable, and spacious. They have kitchenettes which include microwave, fridge stocked with ultra expensive goodies but still enough room to store some private items, coffee maker, and a sink. They also have a dishwasher and not sure what you would need that for even though one of my lascivious friends told me that sometimes people stick their sexy toys in there. The room has a freaky vibe since anyone in the Japanese soaking tub could be seen from the bedroom due to carefully placed window. The also have a window in the bedroom that opens up to view the shower. The lesson here is to not take any of your horny friends to the Cosmo they also have a pleasure kit in the room which probably costs  and includes some intimate items that could make your night a good one. Ok this sex stuff caused me to digress. The bathroom is very large with nice toiletries.  The closet is also huge. The bed was very comfortable but the pillows werent firm enough. Other high pointsnnBarsLounges  the place to be right now in Las Vegas. The crowds tend to be younger and the bartenders here are exquisitely skilled. Every drink I ordered was fantastic. They also dont hold back on the alcohol. Visited The Chandelier a few times and Bond. Didnt make it to Marquee since Benny Benassi and Kaskade were there the weekend I was there and I didnt feel like fighting the crowds. The Chandelier is a nice place to people watch as they pass by all hoed up to go to Marquee. nnRestaurants  Tons of great places to get food here. We visited Holsteins, The Wicked Spoon, and Pizzeria. The more expensive joints are on the rd floor and we didnt make it here even though we had planned too. If you look at all the ratings collectively for the Cosmopolitan restaurants I dare you to find another hotel on the Strip that beats them currently. This place knows how to do good food.nnCasino  Small as compared to others on the Strip. Limited selection of machines but everyone playing the tables seemed to be having a good time. Dont go to Cosmopolitan if gambling is your sole reason to stay at a hotel. nnConference Rooms  I actually attended a conference here and it was one of the best conference centers I have been in. The AV was top notch. We had catered breakfast from the hotel each morning which was fantastic. Beautiful interior. Cant wait until they offer another conference here.nnThe Cosmopolitan clearly has a antiugly hiring policy. Everyone that works there is gorgeous. Hell even the maid staff seems to look like one of the first few contestants knocked off Americas Next Top Model. I had to do a double take because I thought the bartender one night was Alexander Skarsguerd. The staff there were also wired with blue tooth headsets. We called down for toilet paper one night and had it there in  minutes. Sydney Bristow couldnt have been that fast. These people dont play when it comes to communication or customer service.nnFREE WIFI!! Take note other Vegas hotels. Its fast as hell too.nnA few gripes. The pool area is very small. Definitely not equipped to handle the amount of rooms they have. Our room was on the st floor of the East Tower but we could clearly hear club beats all night. Had we not been so tired at the end of each day this could have put a serious crimp in my sleep schedule. nnI am absolutely in love with this place and will be back. Cant miss if you are planning a trip to Vegas."
1,I kid you not this is by far the best middle of nowhere rest stop. Weve been traveling for days now and have stopped a countless rest stops with nasty bathroom. This place is totally different. The bathrooms are new and CLEAN. Not at all what youd expect to find at a has station.
1,"BRAVO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!nnOK If you have seen the show you dont need my opinion, and if you havent seen the show I wont ruin it for you.  So whats the point of my review?  Besides sharing my insightful words with you in Yelpland?  Is to tell you what experiences made this show amazing for me,nnOK, so first.....  As we were walking in to the stadium late there was a Tall HANDSOME italian man eying me.  I gave him the eye and smile and darn near ran in the place to take my seat.  Well, it worked.  After the show was over there he was waiting for me and my mom.  He said he bought a ticket to see the show just to meet me.  OMG!  Well he took us both to a late dinner and drinks.  And I saw him everyday for the remaining of my trip.  After the trip was over we never spoke again, but he swept me off my feet.  And that accent.... Yum.nnNext, and this is the big one.  So like I was saying we were late.... as we were running to our seats i noticed the spotlight was on.  OK, show is starting hurry mom come on. Oh wait, is the spotlight on me?  OMG what do I do what do I do.  Well i put my head down and try and scoot by the people in my way.  Hey, what is everyone laughing at?  Well let me tell you what everyone was laughing at.  The MC followed me the whole time and pulled a fake bra from behind me.  The WHOLE stadium was laughing and I was ready to cry.  Lol, during intermission everyone in the bathroom kept saying You are the girl with the bra.  HAHAHAHAHAHAHA It was embarrassing but a once in a lifetime experience.  nnSo go, and be late lol."
1,"So, this last Sunday, I was at the gym working out.  And, then it hit me! Uh Oh  its Fathers Day.  I knew we were going to have a huge BBQ, as we had family in from out of town.  I was in need of a card and a bag of my pops favorite candy Orange Slices.  So, I made a quick stop at this CVS because its on my way home from the gym.  I walk in and Tracie, who is running the front counter, smiled at me and gave me a quick Hello!  I walked over to the card section, which was extensive, and chose out a card.... well... more like grabbed a card and an envelope.  Im a guy, and we dont go through the cards carefully looking for the right words that fit our feelings.... blah... blah... blah.  Anyhow, I grabbed a couple of bags of Orange Slices, which is way more important than the card to my father.  I get to the front and I had to wait for a couple of Chatty Cathys to get through the line.  Man, they could talk and then having to wait for them to try and use their gift cards.  ETERNAL!!! But, I wasnt really in that big of a hurry, but its still a little annoying.  They ended up paying in cash and left.  What took them  minutes  only took me .  Tracie said, Thanks for coming in, Hun and off I went.nnSo, I give CVS  stars... mainly because of the selection they had in Fathers Day cards and Tracie."
1,"Whether you want to go for lunch with your colleagues, happy hour, a few drinks after work, Vidas a great place. I know because Ive done all of that multiple times and was never disappointed.nnVida Chicken, the tacos, sandwiches are all good. Drinks are good too. Personally, wasnt so crazy about their Enchiladas but it could have been that I wasnt so hungry. Id say the best thing about this place though, is that if you are looking for a place to eatdrink as a group in center city, and theres no consensus, this place is perfect.nnNow, I must advise you to make a reservation if you are heading over for lunch on a weekday. It will be packed! If you dont youll most likely wait. But luckily, the servers are nice so it makes up for the wait. Thanks."
1,"Having travelled the U.S. extensively as an aficionado and connoisseur of hot wings , when my business brings me to Phoenix, all I can think of is the hot wings I will be getting.  It is to that little obscure place located at rd and Indian School behind some Car Wash known as Long Wongs that I will head. It has been there for  years. Primarily a callin and takeout establishment with very limited seating, you wont get Chinese food but you will get the meatiest and crunchiest wings dripping in one of Long Wongs own secret hot saucesfrom mild to suicide at your own risk including honey BBQ made with REAL honey and a house made ranch to die for,. Long Wongs also features the usual made UNUSUALLY delicious  all beef dogs, burgers, and REAL HOMEMADE curlyQ fries. Great place! nnLT"
1,"So much has been said already, and I agree with all of the positive points.  One recurring negative is the menu on the wall.  I can see how it is somewhat annoying, especially for those sitting right under it, being constantly crowded by other customers.  nnThe reason for the  star rating is directly related to the choices I made.  The double down foie gras was tasty but over the top rich with the deep frying and breading.  Then I had the bacon rib.  Delicious again, the veggies and apples went well with the dish.  The rib itself is a thick, boneon slice of bacon slowly braised  addictively rich rich rich.  Tasted great!  Dessert, fantastic.nnComing back home, however, I could feel the fat, the richness rolling in my mouth you know what I mean right?.  Somewhat unpleasant.  nnThe menu is full of dishes that are not as rich as what I sampled.  I will return and be more diligent in my selections not to exceed the overrichness threshold that even a few shots of grappa could not temper.  nnDavid McMillan stopped by to say hi, that was neat!"
1,"i really didnt expect the setup inside when i walked in. instead of a get in and get out type joint, i found a pretty nice, casual sit down restaurant with an attempt at a loungebar area. not bad. nnthe menu was extensive and offered a variety of vegetarian options im a meat girl so i went for the gyro. service was fast and friendly. not a bad place to go for lunch, but if you want to take out i suggest calling ahead first and putting your order in."
1,"We stopped here for a tasty lunch one afternoon and had a pretty charming experience.  The food was delicious, albeit the lunch portions seemed smaller than common sense would dictate, even at the reduced prices we were charged.nnThe booze was expensive, but the service was impeccable and it made for an enjoyable lunch. Id go back and pay dinner prices for a little more hearty meal.  My first taste indicates it might be worth the price."
1,"This place is GORGEOUS.  The beautiful layout of this place and the different rooms... love it.nnFood is awesome.  We had the November  course meal with the wine pairing and it was GREAT.  Hubby and I really enjoyed ourselves.nnWe got to sit out on the patio next to the fire pit... thats the best spot if you ask me.  I was wearing something sleeveless and it was slightly chilly out, but the fire pit and the warmers around kept it perfect.nnI did have one of their pomaritas... pomegranate margarita and it was EXCELLENT.  The mixture was great... thats one of those drinks that you could keep drinking, and then stand up to leave and fall over. hahannThe bathrooms are beautiful.   Each stall has its own sink!  Love it.nnWhat was even cooler was that the server and the hostess even addressed us by name we had a reservation and also congratulated us on our marriage and wished my hubby happy birthday.   It was a nice touch.  I also got a call the next day from Sassi to make sure that everything went well.nnBTW... before I went here, I was looking thru Yelp for the dress code for Sassi... I did see some go in there in some nice jeans and nice shoes... but no tennis shoes, no tshirts.  I wore a very nice black sleeveless top that was revealing with a nice black skirt and heels, and I felt perfectly comfortable."
1,"I love this coffee shop  its what I imagine Madison should be. Mermaid is small, relaxed and slightly hipster. Its a great place to grab a coffee and sandwich, and chill for an hour or two doing homework. The menu is more exciting than typical coffee shops sandwiches  soups feature Indian, Vietnamese and Caribbean touches. nI wish it was walking distance from campus, but then I fear itd lose its charm and turn into an undergrad hangout. Im happy to abide by its cashonly rules, since it adds good karma to the neighborhood. Yay, Mermaid!"
1,"The Chandelier is a multistory love bar in the middle of the Cosmopolitan Hotel. Its a memorable setting with memorable drinks and plenty of unique couches, seats, and tables. Its easy to find a spot just right for you and your friends.nnPlus one star for having several flavors of Hangar One Vodka available!nnAnother bonus star for super friendly, but efficient servers. No complaints at all.nnMy wife rated the Cosmopolitan hotels house Cosmopolitan  her favorite drink in Vegas. If shes happy, then Im happy. nnI was looking for something different and tried a cocktail called Bruce Tea  with Kai Coconut Pandanus Vodka, St. George Thai Basil Eau de Vie, Lemongrassinfused Coconut Cream, Birdseye Chili, Ginger Puree, Kaffir Lime Leaves, and sprinkled with Matcha Tea Powder. It was too different. I switched to Hangar One Mandarin and Tonic  for the rest of the evening.nnIf you are staying or visiting the Cosmopolitan Hotel, it will be hard to miss the giant crystal strands of the Chandelier. It may not be a destination bar, but it is the best bar at the Cosmopolitan. Dont miss the opportunity to relax for a few rounds of drinks."
1,"Stopped in Suarez after another great lunch at flying biscuit. SO GOOD. Cupcakes were great, strawberry lemonade was perfect with the surprise strawberry filling inside. The cookies were great too. Cant beat a chocolate chip cookie. We had a snickerdoodle as well, I liked it my friend said it was on the edge of being too dry. Cannoli was decent too. Worth stopping by if youre in the area."
1,"Came here for a facial last week, I had a great experience. I unfortunately have problematic skin and my Esthetician provided me a great facial to eliminate all problems. She also suggested I purchase some items from the salon to use at home. The facial was very relaxing and painful, as all facials should be! For only  I left very satisfied. I suggest this place highly."
1,"Culinary genius . Atmosphere was buzzy but I had a slight suspicion that it was for the food and it sure was. I found out this man that owns this restaurant has an empire of them . The reason being the food is simply done they way a hearty chief with soul Intended.  Its amazing the salad ouef and then the double cheeseburger , have u wonder what a macdonalds cheeseburger would taste like if the ingredients were real and fresh? Fresh? Fluffy?  well this is the winner, I was moaning amazballs. Yyyyyyuuuuuummmmmiiiii"
1,"Today I had an opportunity to try a veggie sub. Id always been unsure about it but today was the day to give it a try. When the sub arrived at my table after being crafted by Greg Gimon the first attribute that caught my attention was the aroma. The sub almost demanded to be eaten,  not only eaten but devoured. And it was not to be denied. It tasted great. It also fell apart very nicely. All in all it hit the spot nicely."
1,On my way to vega I wanted to have some fresh juice and healthy food. So I stopped here at elixir. It is clean and spacious although the decor is not really very appealing. I ordered fresh carrot juice with ginger my kids got a smoothie And a Mac n cheese. So far just ok until the coconut squash soup came...omg delicious. Nice to have some fresh foo before heading into Vegas. Also the server was super cool an friendly.
1,"Stacey is a sweetheart! Everything is very clean. I have been waxing for years I am Brazilian and it is hard for me to be satisfied with a wax job, but I am! I really recommend her and I will go back."
1,"It was a pleasant dinner away from the busy strip. We made a reservation for our anniversary a couple weeks in advance. The restaurant is small, so reservations are a must. We ordered the omakase and it did not disappoint. The fish was very fresh and high quality. All I can say is kamashita! Wow. Melt in your mouth. Ikura marinated in dashi was also delicious. Both service and food were excellent. I would give food . stars and services  stars. Cant wait to return the next time Im in Vegas."
1,"a great place to pregame before heading out on the town. the signature cocktails, at a  price tag, are unique and well worth it! to my surprise the appetizers offered were delicious! favorite pick is definitely the pigs in a blanket."
1,"My husband and I live right across the street, and after months of driving by and commenting how we should try the Rusty Onion, we finally pulled the trigger last night! We split the Rusty Onion app, he got the Eyetalian sandwich with fries, and I got the Portobello Pie with the house salad also came with bread. I loved my meal it was unique, delicious, and filling! He loved the fried but wasnt crazy about the sandwich said it was salty but it could have been because of the Italian meats which can tend to be salty. The app was delicious sauteed onions and a garlicky cream sauce over toasted pita bread I could have eaten that pita bread all night! Yum. Overall we left happy and are planning to go back to try more of their menu. The total for our meal was  including tip."
1,"Ill start of by saying this is the first Brazilian BBQ place I have been to. nThe food, taste wise was excellent, although I was expecting more meats or selections. Their pork was excellent, as was the spicy chicken and roast pineapple, maybe something exotic even. The meat buffet includes the salad bar and the options were awesome. Lots of different options without being over bearing.nPS check in with yelp and everyone that orders the meat buffet gets  off nTry the fried bananas too!"
1,"Great place, just had some awesome stuffed mushroom with gorgonzola cheese,tomatoes with mozzarella on top. Tried the Rigatoni Bolognese and it is the best sauce and the amount served was perfect. My friend had the spaghetti and meatballs and raved about them. They include a great salad. The bread and dipping was great too.. I will be back with friends. Cant wait to try their other items on the menu.nThanks to Lou the owner And Sabby our waitress for a great meal."
1,Known about Venezias ever since I was in high school. Would goto the one on pecks and McQueen that recently moved to Cooper and ray I think.  I was excited to find one near my work on the was side.  Been here many many times and have never been disappointed.  My favorite and beat pizza in Az.  I compare all other pizza restaurants  I could live off pizza and none have surpasses venezias!
1,"The first time I came here, the vendors for vegetables and fruits was plentiful. There were some essential items here and there that are priced within reason and budget, and out of the farmers markets this one is in my top two. I bought several ears of corn earlier in the summer of this year, and have to say it was the sweetest, best tasting corn Ive ever tasted in my life. All of their produce is high quality.nnTheir vendors seem to switch themselves, for the several other times Ive visited, there were some vendors I liked that werent around. Its a quite a bit of a drive for anyone who isnt located in or near Henderson, but is worth it for anyone looking to support you local growers and markets. Youre always bound to find something new here!nn BRING CASH WITH YOU ONLY!"
1,"Ive always wanted a family friendly jeweler.  Esp. if my at the time boyfriend was going to buy me an engagement ring.  It means so much to me to have the true customer service when buying fine Jewelry, someone I can trust.  And when I found this place one day while I was at CVS I knew I had found a Gem pun intended! Peggy really made me and my now finance feel like we were family.  She helped him pick out my fabulous ring and answer every single one of his questions.  Im so proud to tell everyone where we got the ring from because I think everyone should know about this place!  If your looking for great jewelry with a warm smile, head on over.  They are so excited to help you!"
1,"Its Easter Monday, you ate watery soup for lunch, youre starving but have an appointment in  minutes after which youre going to pints. WHAT DO YOU DO??nnIf youre me, you go to the nearest cafe and get a brownie. If youre my beloved, you have a lightbulb moment and suggest Hendersons for something rather healthier and, as I discovered, just as tasty as a brownie. nnWe split the bean wrap.  The Man thought we should each get our own but I thought sharing would be perfect as we were just there for a hearty snack to keep us going. The wrap was FILLED with tasty bean pate ie, smooth beans and roast veggies. It HIT THE SPOT.  He even agreed that half a wrap was the perfect amount of food. nnIt was absolutely the best thing we could have chosen and we both felt our rumbling tummies soothe and thank us for the deliciousness.  nnHendersons will definitely be our goto place for a quick bite whenever were stranded in the New Town area."
1,"I have been here several times now. Every time it has been really good.nFor starters it is a great price, then they always do a great job.nThey do nails and waxing as well. Which saves you a lot of time.nIt is very clean, and the staff is very nice. nThey are always happy and not complaining about their boss or co workers.nThey have upgrades but, they dont try to push them on you. Only if you want it. Parking lot is a good size and the bathrooms are clean. nI never have to wait very long to be helped. Or not at all.nAgain did I mention how good the price is?? Awesome!"
1,"Yep.. Yep. Yep.. Solid meal....nnTried the ahi with noodles, both of the soups, the salad with crab and shrimp and of course the hot bread..nnAll were very good.nnThe mojitos were tasty as well."
1,"Two words Rocket Wrap. I was over the moon for the Rocket Wrap during lunch a few days back. Pardon the pun. Or not.nnYes, Ms. Tonya P and I met for lunch and both decided that the Rocket Wrap was our meal of choice and it was damn tasty falafel, halloum cheese, lettuce, tomato, cucumber and tahini sauce. The falafel was nicely put together, the tahini was on point but the halloum cheese was magical. It was like a mozzarella stick gone wild. LOVE.nnWhile the wrap is generous in size, I have to whine a bit about its price . That seems a bit steep for just a wrap...no side item. However, my dining partner did mention that halloum cheese is pretty pricey, so thats cool. I also had the chance to try a bit of tabouli which was flavorful and nicely seasoned. nnThe interior of Kabob Grill isnt much to look at, but with a really delicious Rocket Wrap, I could care less. Service was fine and we never went without beverages! Ill be back, Kabob Grill."
1,"We came here for breakfast and I liked this place. I ordered the eggs Benedict and it was perfect. The taste was great and the size was good maybe too small for others. The bread was absolutely fantastic I ordered a side since it was THAT good. My wife had an omelette, which was good but nothing extraordinary. nnThe atmosphere was a bit too big and open for me. For breakfast, I tend to like more quaint, homeyfeeling places. This atmosphere was a bit cold for me but the food distracted me enough to where it wasnt an issue. nnI havent been here for other meals but Id recommend it for breakfast!"
1,OMG!!! I love this Chanel store. The service here is way better than the one in SF. Lol. My sales lady was Jacqueline and she was beyond good. She helped me with everything. My hubby got me the jumbo flap bag and Im loving it. I cant wait to go back and treat myself with another Chanel bag. Lol
1,"The service was great. Responsive and friendly. So we started off the the yellow curry crab cakes. I mean potato cakes. The flavor was decent but I felt cheated because I kept feeling like the old lady on the Wendys commercial wheres the crab?!. If they just renamed the appetizer I would not have felt like I was duped. However, when my duck entree came out it certainly made up for the loss. The sweet chili flavor was spot on! The rice was topped off with a fried egg. I would definitely order it again. My wife ordered the Pad Kee Mao with chicken, mild and sweet. She liked it as well. The sticky rice was like a cozy warm sweet coconut kiss. I would recommend checking it out."
1,Cons the gold shock! is incredibly tacky  offputting and the gift shop is basically a shrine to Trump and his family.nnNeutral pro or con dependent on who you are children everywhere esp in the pool and jacuzzi petfriendly no casino.  nnPros  the rooms were comfy  large included a kitchentee freebottled water in the room staff was friendly and approachable no crazy cab line out front the hotel was a stones throw away  from the Fashion Show Mall and the Wynn affordable when compared to other like hotels on the Strip healthy options cafe onsite.
1,"Really good Philly Cheesesteak sandwich. I wasnt sure what to expect from a fast food chain like that but the resulting sandwich was VERY good. Filling enough, but not so much that you feel stuffed.nnAmbiance is...similar to any fast food restaurant. Loud and sometimes not as clean as youd like. However, you have to kind of temper your expectation since a fast food experience isnt going to be some star restaurant.nnGood food, reasonable price even on the strip and it was made quickly and efficiently. Ill definitely go again."
1,Wonderful mojitos here. We got a few and walked around the shops with them after wed spent enough time watching the gondola trips going around and around. Nice. Id come back for drinks since the setting is so great.
1,"Wolfits is one of many sandwich and salad bars in Edinburgh, but it is worth a visit. Situated on Rose Street, Wolfits is right in the centre of the city and it is just around the corner from the main shopping area in Edinburgh, Princes Street, and so it is a convenient place to reach. nnThey serve a whole range of sandwiches, baguettes and rolls, as well as lots of salad options and soup. I have been here several times over the last few weeks to buy my lunch. They have a deli type section displaying a range of filings such as meats, cheeses and salad. I have played it pretty safe here and stuck to their steak and cheese baguette, which is really tasty and very well priced at less than ua! Breakfast rolls are also available here so it would be a good place to stop by for a bacon roll in the morning. nnThis store is pretty much an extension of the big sandwich chains such and Quinzos Subs and Subway, but if you want to buck the trend and buy your baguette from a local business, Wolfits is definitely the place to go."
1,"I was so jetlagged when I ate here....nnBut I loved loved loved the food!nnI had the pigeon with haggis, and then the scallops with more haggis, and a bunch of beer.  So great!nnThe food really was artfully done.nnOn tip though.... we were in our touristy garb, jeanssweaters... and everyone else around us was rather dressy.  Made me feel like such a scrub.nnId come back here next time Im in Edinburgh for sure."
1,"This place is great! nnIts a cozy little hometown restaurant that has fantastic and friendly service along with delicious food.nnMy husband and I went after having read about it here on yelp, and it really was a great spot to grab a bit to eat. I tried one of their burgers and it was delicious. It tasted homegrilled and not processed. My husband had the pear sandwich that everyone talks about and he really enjoyed it. nnThe service was also incredibly welcoming and friendly. I highly recommend our waiter, Tanner, as he had great suggestions for the food as well as some great conversation.nnI advise everyone to check it out. I cant wait to go back, especially considering it is easy on the wallet!"
1,"Ive been there more times that I can count. nThe main reason is that the people there work so hard and so well. nThe food is great for pub food, better than many restos.nThe alcohol can get a little expensive and its unfortunate you can only buy beer by the glass but I can see a few reasons for that other than the obvious lucrative aspect for the owner. nWaiters are always there to check if youre ok and need anything else and make you feel looked after and appreciated. nQualityprice the best place in the entire area."
1,We ordered a cake for our sons wedding in September. William was very helpful and professional.  The cake was so beautiful and delicious that we ordered another cake for my husbands th birthday celebration.  Once again the cake was a hit! Delicious moist vanilla cake with raspberry mousse filling.
1,"If there is ever a time to cry because breakfast is so darn good, this place will have you bawling your eyes out! The food was perfectly prepared, beautifully plated and most importantly, AMAZING!!! The restaurant was a hip little place with enough color to wake up the eyes but the smells of the restaurant is what wakes up the rest! I had the gypsy steak skillet with a side of lemon blueberry frenchtoast. My girlfriend had the toasted coconut mango crepe. Both plates made the table fall silent since all we wanted was just to keep eating! SO GOOD! Definitely my new favorite place for breakfast!"
1,"My friend and I both agreed to meet in Montrueal to spend some time exploring the city. We found a Groupon online for Kaiji. Both of us being world travelled and avid lovers of food, the groupon being a great deal and the menu looked great, we sought it as a new adventure.nnWe were not disappointed. As we are staying in a downtown hotel, we required to plan our transit journey as the restaurant seemed to be a bit out of the downtown area. Walking from the subway to the restaurant, we were a bit unsure. The neighbourhood seemed relatively quiet and uneventful.nnArriving at the restaurant, we were immediately pleased with the decor, the settings, the volume and any initial doubts were soothed. The staff greeted us pleasantly and we started out menu selections.nnThe food was prepared very well and served at a great pace. The rich blends of flavours, combined with an amazing display met for our delight. Having lived in Vancouver, BC for sometime now, we were extremely delighted to find this sushi restaurant and with the menu.nnOne thing to note is, it is BYO Bottle and we forgot this. So, if you choose to come hear, BYO Bottle.  nnHighly Recommend, Worth the Effort."
1,"This Urgent is by no means the closest to my home but it got the best reviews and after a visit, I can see why.  You can book an appointment online which eliminates the hospitalwaitingroomesque quality of many urgent cares.  The facility is new and well maintained.  nnThe nurse practitioner was very thorough in treating me.  Its obvious they are very patientcentered here and thats nice to see."
1,"I patronize this place for one primary reason the coca pina cocktail. ITs overpriced for sure, but is ohso delicious. Delicious! And its served in an actual coconut. Do you like coconut? Then you should come drink this cocktail. Its everything a coconut drink should be. Its so yummy that I can down  before realizing I just drank that many. Its sweet and smooth and is just plain yummy. So come on in to the bar and devour a few of these.nnOh, and they have food too. The food is pretty tasty as well. Seems quite authentic and worth the price. Plus, the service is very attentive."
1,"First time visit last weekend. We were a party of . I had the steak au poivre. OH SOO YUMMY! The sauce was to die for. THE FRIES.. you have never had fries like this.. and they went so well with the sauce. Someone ordered the muscles and the sauce and the muscles were also delicious!nThe French baguettes they serve with your meal was great. WE had Different sides and all were good. We ordered a few desserts and also all were devoured..nI conducted a survey of our party of  and everyone LOVED THE PLACE!nThe service was great too.nPlace is a bit noisy, though I am sure our party added to the noise!nYou can sit outside and have a beautiful view of the Bellagio fountains!nBon Appetit!"
1,"Ive been in this place often for their happy hours, but never for their Brunch.nYesterday I tried their brunch with low expectation reading the reviews, but I found it quit acceptable! Yes  there is nothing exceptional but my egg Benedict was well prepared and loved the spinach and salmon coming with it. They also serve very good coffee!nAnd most importantly they have a great wine list you can have with you brunch ... why not .."
1,"I lived in New York for  years and ate a lot of bagels, and I have to say this bagel is as good as it gets. Gotham rivals, if not beats, any bagel Ive ever had in New York and I cant believe I was lucky enough to find this place here in Madison when I came to Wisconsin. I stock up on bagels as much as I can whenever I visit to bring them back Milwaukee.nnI have visited the Park Street location a few times and I have spoken with the owner more than once. He has always seemed amiable and eager to talk to me about New York and whatnot. I see people on here complain about the rude service but I have to say, I havent really experienced that. Sometimes the conversation at the register is a bit more terse than maybe people in Wisconsin are used to, but I have never found it to be flat out rude. Ill be back to Gotham for sure."
1,"I have now become a loyal Lightning Lube customer! The service is fast and friendly and they dont try to rip you off! What more could you ask for in an oil change? The waiting area is clean and I love how they keep it simple! I dropped in they took my keys,  minutes later they charged my card and gave me the keys! It was affordable and didnt include an awkward sales pitch on oil, tires, filters etc. Perfect!"
1,"This may be my new favorite airport simply because of this cafe. I didnt think I would find both vegan and gluten free options at an airport but this place has it all. The food was delicious, reasonable prices, great service and so many options. It was such a blessing to be able to sit down and enjoy a nice, hot meal. nnI had the Zuni burrito no egg, no tortilla. It had tofu, potatoes, spinach and mushrooms. It was hot and scrumptious and only .. I also decided to try the Spicy Chickpea Lettuce Wrap which had two pretty big sized lettuce wraps topped with mashed garbanzo beans made with olive oil, red onions, celery, red bell pepper, cayenne pepper and paprika. It was all topped with fresh avocado and sundries tomatoes. It was only .. nnI also loved that this place had lots of sit down seating. You just get in line to order, then they call your name. There were several lines with different options. There was a pizza station with vegan and gluten free pizza!, a sandwich salad line, breakfast foodburgers and this place even had a coffee bar with specialty drinks and baked goods I didnt see vegan gluten free baked goods. I will definitely try to get more layovers at this airport so that I can eat here again."
1,"Found out about this place via a Yelp email that was advertising places in my area. After checking out the reviews and the menu, my wife and I decided to grab a late dinner here on a Friday night. As soon as we arrived I noticed this place just had an awesome vibe to it. Friendly staff, laid back patio seating, and the food is beyond amazing. We had the Fried Green Tomato sandwich, Little Birdy fried chicken biscuit, Fries, and a glass bottle Coke the kind sweetened with real sugar. nnIn a nutshell Love this place. Well be going back again and again."
1,"Tonya has been my hairdresser for   years.  Very reliable and flexible, has accommodated me at last minute many times.  She is now turning my red hair which was beautiful to blond.  Ive gotten two complements and it was just done hours ago.  I love the way she can show me what will look good on me and my kind of hair.  All I have referred to her have been very happy and have stayed with her. She has made my husbands Valentines Day a happy one with his new blond wife!"
1,Really beautiful  minute nature cruise. We went on Sunday morning May th. Its a real deal at . and we had an Entertainment Book Coupon for Buy One Get One Free. Bald Eagle nest with babies  rare Crested Saguaro. Priceless. The captain and crew are great and they have a little snack and drink bar. They play the song I Love You Arizona and it is really touching. Very fun time  Highly recommended.
1,"Ive not been back to one of these kinds of places for a couple years since getting heartburn from the combination sauce. Knowing the garlic gets to me, I knew what to stay away from. nnI ordered the shrimp currently . lb in Cajun medium. Dont let the medium fool you, its spicy, and really good. IMO the crawfish is too much work for little meat. nnThe gumbo without rice was tasty and filling. nnChicken wings were straight forward and were pretty large in size. nnThe oysters were from the gulf and they were the big ones... and is was fishy to me. Not a fan. nnI would definitely come back and like another Yelper tipped, its awesome and convenient take out."
1,"Las Vegas Jewelry and Coin Buyers helped me get a diamond for my engagement ring. They were awesome from beginning to end. I live in Chicago, but had a relationship with the sister store in Westmont, IL. When it came time to purchase an engagement ring, I knew who to call. They worked tirelessly to make our big day a success. We show off the ring every chance we get. I highly recommend Las Vegas Jewelry and Coin."
